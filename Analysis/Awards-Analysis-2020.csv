Smooth dynamical systems may exhibit chaotic behavior, this is where the future evolution of the systems is strongly independent of its present state and the evolution behaves like a sequence of independent coin tosses. The principal investigator plans to study such chaotic behavior for a wide class of natural dynamical systems. The developed methods will result in progress in the understanding of fundamental dynamical phenomena, with possible applications to other mathematical fields such as geometry and number theory, and also to the natural sciences.  The principal investigator also plans to be involved in synergistic activities including organizing conferences and working with graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>Chaotic properties of (uniformly) hyperbolic systems are by now well understood. Much less is known for partially hyperbolic systems, especially those with non-trivial (fast) growth on the center space.  The principal investigator plans to create a general framework for studying K and Bernoulli properties for partially hyperbolic systems, and also plans to study mixing and spectral properties of parabolic systems, trying to further develop a general theory for systems of polynomial orbit growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The particular class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems is especially important from this perspective. For instance, such equations and systems play a role in the theoretical study of composite materials. This project will contribute to a basic understanding of fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems, thereby providing scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the quality of consumer products manufactured from composites. As part of the project, the principal investigator will train Ph.D. students, many of whom are expected to continue their careers as educators and help convey the long-term value of mathematical research not only to science and engineering but also, in the end, to society.<br/> <br/>At a technical level, this project is a natural continuation of the principal investigator's earlier work, which includes valuable contributions to this research area. One part of the project concerns a longstanding open problem on the existence and compactness of solutions to a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem. This is equivalent to solving, on a Riemannian manifold, a fully nonlinear elliptic, but not uniformly elliptic, partial differential equation of second order. The current understanding of this type of equations is insufficient, especially compared to what is known for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic second order equations, where theories are much more mature. The study of this open problem should lead to a better understanding of these elliptic, but not uniformly elliptic, equations. It will also lead to a better understanding of degenerate elliptic fully nonlinear equations of second order. This project will provide new analytical tools for the study of these and other important nonlinear partial differential equations arising from geometry and physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That is, given knowledge of the present, what can we say about the distant future or distant past? In most situations, the answer must be given in terms of probability.  This leads to the question of identifying and studying natural (invariant) probability measures. Thermodynamic formalism, which is a dynamical theory originally inspired by statistical mechanics, is a framework for answering this kind of question. The geodesic flow is the dynamical system given by moving at unit speed along paths that minimize distance. This flow has special importance because of its relationship with the geometry and topology of the underlying space. The geodesic flow has inspired many important developments in dynamical systems theory, in particular leading to the definitions on which hyperbolic dynamics is based. This research project pursues a distinctive vision for progress in this area, with focus on developing novel techniques suitable for application to geodesic flows in more general settings. The award also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The project has four parts. Part 1 develops fundamental results in thermodynamic formalism suitable for applications to dynamical systems of geometric origin. The focus is on the non-compact world, building on previous advances made for closed non-positive curvature manifolds. Areas of interest include non-compact CAT(-1) spaces, non-positive curvature manifolds with cusps, and as a long-term goal, thermodynamics for the Weil-Petersson geodesic flow. Part 2 considers statistical and dynamical properties for equilibrium states, particularly Central Limit Theorems and second order differentiability. Part 3 develops a deeper dynamical understanding of geodesic flow for CAT(?1) spaces. We investigate analogues of the SRB measure, particularly in the setting of CAT(?1) metrics on closed surfaces. Part 4 concerns questions about Katok entropy rigidity in dynamical systems, particularly for non-compact surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS) is a two-week summer school and workshop that aims to provide early-career graduate students with an introduction to the fundamental techniques and current research in operator algebras. In addition, GOALS aims to increase, in this field, the participation and retention of persons from traditionally underrepresented groups by removing technical barriers to the field and building a strong community of support among the participants, contributors, and organizers. <br/><br/>The field of operator algebras is a branch of functional analysis, which has a long-standing dialogue with various fields of mathematics and physics, such as topology, group theory, conformal field theory, probability, and logic, to name a few.

Operator algebras is an area of mathematics which began with the work of Murray and von Neumann in the 1930's motivated in part by Heisenberg's approach to quantum mechanics in terms of infinite matrices.  Von Neumann's development of operators on a Hilbert space put Heisenberg's ideas on rigorous foundations.  In this theory, the observable data is represented by certain operators (i.e. infinite matrices) on a Hilbert space.  One of the most famous concepts of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that the speed and position of a particle cannot be known simultaneously.  The mathematically rigorous version of this statement is that the operators P and Q which measure position and momentum do not commute; i.e. PQ and QP are not equal (there is, however, a precise formula relating P and Q).  Operator algebras is the study of algebraic relations between collections of operators.  Amenable operators algebras form a particularly important class of operators algebras.  In recent years, there has been a substantial work in classifying simple amenable operator algebras. In a certain sense, the simple examples are the basic building blocks of the theory.  The goal of this project is to understand the relations between the simple amenable operator algebras (such as ways one can be embedded into the other) and the symmetries of such algebras and to exploit these ideas to uncover structural information about operator algebras as a whole. This project also will be contributing to the education of the US workforce through the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More technically, recent progress in Elliott's Program shows separable, simple, nuclear, regular C*-algebras in the UCT class are classified up to isomorphism via their operator K-theory groups, their trace simplex, and the pairing between them.  This should be viewed as a direct analogue to the Connes-Haagerup classification of separably acting injective factors in terms of their type and flow of weights.  The Connes-Haagerup classification has become a corner stone of modern von Neumann algebra theory, and the C*-algebraic analogue may be expected to have an equally important role in C*-algebra theory.  In recent joint work with Carrion, Gabe, Tikuisis, and White, the PI showed that embeddings of ""classifiable"" C*-algebras are determined up to approximate unitary equivalence by K-theoretic data.  The aim of this project is to refine and expand on these techniques with an eye towards equivariant classification and non-simple classification, as well as applications to the regularity theory, such as computing the nuclear dimension of a new classes of C*-algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Moreover, complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. The primary aim of the efforts of the PI is to further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. <br/><br/>The PI will advance the understanding of the behavior of holomorphic maps between bounded domains in higher dimensional complex Euclidean space. In the field of several complex variables, there have been many deep investigations into when holomorphic maps extend continuously to the boundary, the behavior of iterations of holomorphic maps, and the properties of the biholomorphism group of a bounded domain. The standard approach to studying these problems uses methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This part of the activity will enhance knowledge about the biholomorphism group of complex manifolds, connections between the boundary of a domain and its complex geometry, the iterations of holomorphic maps, continuous extensions of holomorphic maps, realizations of Hermitian symmetric spaces, and the complex geometry of certain smooth quasi-projective algebraic varieties."

A good number of the issues the PI plans to address are a natural continuation of problems he has explored recently that keep progressing and diffusing through a wider mathematical community. The questions to be studied have a certain universality in the sense that the same paradigm reappears from geometry and analysis, to fluid dynamics and material sciences, to financial mathematics and, more recently, biology and stochastic geometry. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The first project concerns compressible flow (for instance, a gas) in porous media, in particular when the flow has a ""history"" that clogs with time the porous media (the Caputo diffusion model). Some important aspects of the Caputo diffusion model are being studied by the PI and an advanced graduate student, in particular when it occurs through two media with different porosity (transmission condition). Related mathematical phenomena concern the saline flow through semipermeable membranes (where the salt can flow only in one direction through the membrane). Another case where the flow is induced by global considerations concerns the quasi-geostrophic equation: this equation describes the evolution of the temperature on the surface of the ocean, and here temperature is influenced at a distance though the atmosphere. In collaboration with a graduate student the PI is working on the time evolution of this process in the land-sea interphase. Another interesting problem considered is concerned with ""overlapping"" interactions. An example is the structure of pricing for buying vs selling of goods. There is an area of ""values"" of the underlying good where the two prices diverge, and one where they come together. Mathematically, these are very interesting problems concerned with the stability of the configuration, in particular for the edge dividing one behavior from the other in a nonlinear way. In a different area, the PI is studying issues of segregation and predator-prey models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, stars are essentially plasmas - that is gases of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons attracting and repelling one another according to the Coulomb force. The formation of crystals, which are periodic arrangements of atoms, can be roughly explained via repulsive electrostatic (Coulomb) forces coupled with a binding force. In Physics, a ""two-component plasma"" is a large collection of positively charged particles and as many negatively charged particles; a ""one-component plasma"" is a large collection of positively charged particles with the negative particles replaced by a uniform neutralizing background. Such systems are also called ""Coulomb gases,"" and they are quite important in theoretical physics. Physicists predicted that in two-dimensional Coulomb gases, a new intermediate state of matter - formed of dipoles of oppositely charged particles - should exist between the totally ordered (solid) and disordered (liquid) state, once a certain critical temperature is reached. This was a new type of phase transition in statistical physics. It is specific to dimension 2 and an important example of two-dimensional physics. This project is particularly concerned with the analysis of large Coulomb gases in dimension 2 and higher, both one-component and two-component, in the framework of statistical mechanics (that is, with temperature), and using the techniques of mathematical analysis and probability theory. Also motivating such questions are the study of energy levels of large atoms (spectrum of large random matrices), vortices in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates, the fractional quantum Hall effect, and more loosely questions in biology or hydrodynamics. The project also contains a component on the mathematical analysis of vortices in superconductors in the context of the famous Ginzburg-Landau model, another and related instance of two-dimensional physics, with the investigation of this phenomenon in dimension 3. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>This project is about the mathematical analysis of large systems of points, or lines, with Coulomb  interactions. Such systems are ubiquitous in physics models, ranging from quantum  mechanics, statistical mechanics to plasma physics and condensed matter physics, but also in random matrix theory and approximation theory. The main part of the proposal concerns the statistical mechanics of classical Coulomb gases. In a first part it deals with positively charged points. The main questions are to investigate the  effect of temperature on the  local structure of the point configurations, in broad temperature regimes, as well as to understand their possibly universal features. While a lot has been understood in dimension 2, much remains to be done to understand which properties persist in higher dimension, in particular to understand the order of the charge fluctuations and their possibly Gaussian nature, as well as the long-range correlations of the system and free energy expansion. The proposal also aims at understanding  how much of the features are specific to the Coulomb interaction by investigating the same questions for  Riesz gases. A second part concerns the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with opposite charges (or two-component plasma). This is a very important model, related to the XY model in which a similar transition happens, itself an approximation for two-dimensional systems in condensed matter physics  including Josephson junction arrays and thin disordered superconducting granular films. This BKT transition is charcterized by the emergence of dipoles and the transition from exponentially decaying to algebraically decaying correlations. A lot of this behavior is awaiting further mathematical proofs and this is what the project will try to address in the context of the two-component Coulomb gas. Finally the last part of the proposal concerns lines with Coulomb interactions, which arise as vortices in three-dimensional models from superconductivity and superfluidity. The geometry of the lines makes the analysis much more delicate than for points. While many mathematical tools originating in geometric measure theory have been developed for dealing with that aspect, the Coulomb interaction of the lines, the characterization of the onset of vortex lines under an applied magnetic field, and their collective behavior still need to be further investigated. The project's goal is to study all these questions with rigorous mathematical proofs and tools that will mix analysis, PDE, calculus of variations, and probability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is the reason why matrices, which encode noncommutativity in mathematics, are omnipresent in science. In many areas, such as control theory, quantum information theory and random matrix theory, the emerging questions about matrices and their ensembles are phrased so as to be independent of the matrix size. For example, a control system is designed as a black box, and its stability preferably does not depend on size of the input data (matrices) but only on the design and the structure of the system (a function of matrices). The common framework for such problems is provided by free analysis (""free"" as in size-free), which studies functions in matrix variables. When such a function is built using only variables and arithmetic operations, it is called a noncommutative rational function. This project focuses on analytic, algebraic and geometric aspects of noncommutative rational functions and their evaluations on matrices. The goal is to apply novel synergistic techniques to answer fundamental open questions about noncommutative rational functions, apply their resolutions to semidefinite optimization and control theory, and accompany these theoretical results with efficient algorithms.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is twofold. On one hand, it considers questions about noncommutative rational functions that arise from free analysis and real algebraic geometry. Their common thread is the following: given a geometric feature of matrix evaluations of a noncommutative rational function, what can be deduced about its structure? This research focuses on positivity and singularity sets of noncommutative rational functions, their symmetries and existence of rational maps between them, with a view towards transforming non-convex (hard) problems in control theory and optimization into convex (easy) ones. Furthermore, this part of the project addresses natural extensions of noncommutative rational functions, such as noncommutative meromorphic functions and rational functions on operators acting on infinite dimensional spaces. On the other hand, noncommutative rational functions form a free skew field and are therefore related to several fundamental purely algebraic topics, such as the automorphism group of the free skew field, the free Lüroth problem, and the characteristic-free Freiheitssatz in a free algebra. The second part of this project proposes to apply ideas and techniques from free analysis to overcome these challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical physics is one of the oldest scientific disciplines and is very active worldwide, with researchers working in both mathematics and physics departments. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in this country. The GLaMP conferences meet the need for a regular annual meeting in mathematical physics in the US, specifically in the greater Midwest. The main goals of the meetings are: (1) to provide a forum for young researchers in mathematical physics in the US to present their research, as well as to foster their professional development; (2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in the field of mathematical physics throughout the United States; (3) to encourage participation by women and under-represented groups in the field of mathematical physics; and (4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States. Besides its location, the distinguishing feature of the GLaMP meeting is its emphasis on promoting and showcasing the scientific work of young researchers (graduate and advanced undergraduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early-career faculty) in the field. <br/><br/>The GLaMP 2020 and 2021 conferences each consist of a three-lecture mini-course (one lecture each day) on a topic of current high-profile interest, five invited 50-minute plenary talks from leading researchers in their respective fields, and sessions of short 20-minute contributed talks given primarily by young researchers. To increase the visibility and participation by women and under-represented groups in mathematics, the organizers strive to have at least half of the invited plenary talks (including the mini course) be given by researchers from these under-represented groups. As in the past, the organizers will hold the meetings in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). To further highlight the focus of the meeting on the support of young researchers in their professional development, each GLaMP conference features a roundtable discussion on early-career development. The panel of the round table consists of researchers representing both careers in different types of academic institutions (for instance, private and public research universities, four-year liberal arts colleges), as well as in industry. <br/><br/>Details about the meetings will be posted on the conference websites: https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2020 (for GLaMP 2020) and https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2021 (for GLaMP 2021).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optimal transport models have been successfully applied in fields as diverse as atmospheric sciences, surface matching, data clustering, and manifold learning, among others. The theoretical study of optimal transport has greatly advanced in recent years and calls for improved numerical tools that can be mathematically guaranteed to have good performance. This project is aimed at the development of improved numerical methods for optimal transport calculations and variants, employing partial-differential-equation techniques to produce computational tools backed by rigorous theory. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will also engage in outreach by supervising an undergraduate team through the university's Summer Undergraduate Research Institute in Experimental Mathematics program, aimed at students who are at an earlier stage of study, with an eye toward recruitment of students from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. <br/> <br/>Specifically, the project aims to exploit the geometric information that can be discerned from the regularity theory of the Monge-Ampère type equation that arises naturally in optimal transport, in order to develop numerical algorithms with proven convergence rates, error bounds, and computational complexity. The project will also undertake a systematic study of singular behavior when full regularity is unavailable to develop fast and accurate numerical schemes in such difficult cases. One intended application of this latter direction is toward a theory of manifold learning that can be applied to data sets coming from singular geometries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Operator theory began with the study of matrices (arrays of numbers), and by the early twentieth century, had given much of the mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. Since then, operator-theoretic techniques have had several applications, especially in constructing and studying a variety of useful functions, i.e., rules that encode specific types of information. For example, in control engineering, setups such as autopilot systems that accept inputs, receive feedback, and release outputs can be modeled with general matrices (or operators), while a system?s key information is often encoded in its transfer function. Recently, operator theory techniques have also been used to decompose signals into simple pieces, via something called a wavelet construction. In this project, the principal investigator will use operators to study problems related to a specific class of functions, called rational functions, which appear in such applications. Many of these problems have parts that are amenable to undergraduate research, and much of the research in this project will be explored alongside diverse groups of undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>More precisely, this project concerns rational functions in one and more variables that are bounded on certain domains. Such rational functions include finite Blaschke products (FBPs), which have played significant roles in factorization, interpolation, and approximation problems in complex analysis. Recently, FBPs have arisen in the context of a famous open problem in operator theory called Crouzeix?s conjecture, which basically says that the numerical range of a bounded operator on a Hilbert space is a 2-spectral set for that operator. The first goals of this project are to use FBPs to investigate and solve various cases of Crouzeix?s conjecture, use Crouzeix?s conjecture to ask and answer new questions about FBPs, and to explore related questions about spectral sets, compressed shifts, and truncated Toeplitz operators. The second topic of this project concerns multivariate (rational and non-rational) functions on the bidisk and polydisk. Specifically, the second main goal is to use model/realization theory to systematically characterize the structure and fine boundary regularity of bounded analytic functions on the bidisk and polydisk. This goal is motivated by recent work on both the structure of rational inner functions near boundary singularities and new canonical realization formulas for general bounded analytic functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The beauty of the problems is that the formulations of many of them are ""intuitively clear"" not only to graduate students, but also to undergraduates, and in some cases, even to high-school pupils. On the other hand, the answers are very often counter-intuitive, requiring the use of the most advanced and sophisticated tools belonging to the different branches of modern mathematics. Many problems take their origin  not in pure mathematics, but in medical imaging and tomography and the solutions might find very interesting biomedical applications.

The PI and co-PI will continue to use and develop the methods of harmonic analysis to solve the problems arising in convex and discrete geometry. These problems include  a new set of Bezout inequalities for mixed volumes, originating from classical Algebraic Geometry. The inequalities involve the size of projections of convex bodies and lead to very unexpected results in Information Theory and Probability. The principal investigators also plan to continue their work on the set of  problems in Geometric Tomography proposed by Busemann and Petty in 1956. Only the first problem in the list has been solved so far. The PI and co-PI have made progress on a number of problems related to this list using the idea of the iteration of intersection  and projection body operators.

These activities are designed to foster a rich educational environment for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs at UT by increasing introductory research opportunities for undergraduates and research-level training for graduate students. The overall goals of this initiative are to increase the number of math majors going to top-tier graduate schools, increase the number of Ph.D.s obtaining top-tier postdocs, improve the career placement of postdoctoral fellows after their time at UT, and increase the number of women and minorities pursuing advanced degrees and careers in mathematics research and education.<br/><br/>The UTGD is led by seven faculty members at UT Austin. The group brings a wealth of different viewpoints and motivations together, from low-dimensional topology and geometry, to amenability, representation theory, random walks and ergodic theory. Building on a departmental Group Theory and Dynamics Seminar that has run for the past five years, the emphasis and resources of the grant will bring together expertise in the many areas represented by the research group while providing an arena for new mathematics and for the training of new mathematicians. To increase the number of graduate students entering into fields involving higher mathematics, UTGD will provide a summer Directed Reading Program (DRP) designed to prepare undergraduates for graduate school. UTGD will create a course, Experimental Mathematics, and enhance another, Discrete Math, to help prepare students for research. To improve the placement of graduating UT Ph.D.s, this award will enhance the UT graduate program by providing graduate fellowships/traineeships and travel funds and support for graduate mini-Schools and a Groups and Dynamics junior seminar. To build the departmental activity centered around Groups and Dynamics, this award will add four postdoctoral positions and provide visitors to work with postdocs, graduate students, and faculty. In the use of these resources, the management team will actively seek to increase the proportion of members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. The grant also proposes a number of ways to impact mathematics outside the department. The materials resulting from any of the projects will be made available through a dedicated website. The mini-Schools will draw from graduate students nationwide; the undergraduate  conference, and the summer DRP will draw broadly from Texas schools. The Julia Robinson Math Festival will bring engaging and new mathematical experiences to K-12 students in the Austin area.

Harmonic analysis is the study of the scale invariant properties of functions such as the oscillation of violin strings; it underpins much of modern image and signal processing. The calculus of variations is the study of energy minimizers; for example, a soap film hanging off a wire forms a shape which minimizes the surface tension. The purpose of this project is twofold: first to use harmonic analysis to study the behavior of energy minimizers under perturbations (like a soap film in a mild wind). Second, to use techniques from the calculus of variations to study a central problem in harmonic analysis, namely how does diffusion (i.e. heat spreading through a room) detect geometry. This synergy should not only lead to mathematical breakthroughs but also refine our ability to use these mathematical ideas to predict physical phenomena. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The investigator is interested in singularities of minimizers (places where the minimizer fails to be smooth, like the corners soap bubbles form when they touch each other). In particular, the investigator wants to develop tools to study these singularities which are persistent under perturbations (either of the energy or the initial conditions). To develop these tools, new ideas from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory are necessary. The investigator is also interested in the problem of how solutions to elliptic differential equations (which model diffusion) detect the geometry of domains in Euclidean space. Recently, there have been major breakthroughs showing that homogeneous diffusion can detect some geometric features. The investigator believes that ideas from the calculus of variations can extend this breakthrough to understand what finer geometric details inhomogeneous diffusion can detect.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a classical number associated with a dynamical system, called its entropy, that is a quantitative measure of the complexity of the system. An important problem in dynamical systems that has been unsolved for many decades is called Shub's entropy conjecture. It aims at understanding the lower bound of the entropy of a system using asymptotic information of the system. Due to the nature of this conjecture new multi-disciplinary tools from topology and dynamics are needed to fully solve the conjecture.  This project is concerned with developing a tool in dynamical systems, called index theory, in order to advance our general knowledge about the dynamics around fixed points, and with an eye to solving the entropy conjecture. Since this proposal integrates ideas from several branches of mathematics, it will further encourage interactions and collaborations among students and faculty. <br/><br/>The specific research goal of this project is to study the following projects using index theory: 1) entropy non-degeneracy between equivalent analytic flows; 2) the relationship between the growth rate of periodic points and the growth rate of the Lefschetz for analytic maps; 3) the relationship between the growth rate of periodic points and the degree for maps with sufficient regularity on a sphere.  Through these three projects, we will show how to use the index to get entropy non-degeneracy and present how powerful index theory is in finding a topological lower bound for the growth rate of periodic orbits.  Since the three projects are all of a strong topological flavor, these projects are closely related to the entropy conjecture.  As a package, they will provide potential approaches and tools for the entropy conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical physics is one of the oldest scientific disciplines and is very active worldwide, with researchers working in both mathematics and physics departments. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in this country. The GLaMP conferences meet the need for a regular annual meeting in mathematical physics in the US, specifically in the greater Midwest. The main goals of the meetings are: (1) to provide a forum for young researchers in mathematical physics in the US to present their research, as well as to foster their professional development; (2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in the field of mathematical physics throughout the United States; (3) to encourage participation by women and under-represented groups in the field of mathematical physics; and (4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States. Besides its location, the distinguishing feature of the GLaMP meeting is its emphasis on promoting and showcasing the scientific work of young researchers (graduate and advanced undergraduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early-career faculty) in the field. <br/><br/>The GLaMP 2020 and 2021 conferences each consist of a three-lecture mini-course (one lecture each day) on a topic of current high-profile interest, five invited 50-minute plenary talks from leading researchers in their respective fields, and sessions of short 20-minute contributed talks given primarily by young researchers. To increase the visibility and participation by women and under-represented groups in mathematics, the organizers strive to have at least half of the invited plenary talks (including the mini course) be given by researchers from these under-represented groups. As in the past, the organizers will hold the meetings in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). To further highlight the focus of the meeting on the support of young researchers in their professional development, each GLaMP conference features a roundtable discussion on early-career development. The panel of the round table consists of researchers representing both careers in different types of academic institutions (for instance, private and public research universities, four-year liberal arts colleges), as well as in industry. <br/><br/>Details about the meetings will be posted on the conference websites: https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2020 (for GLaMP 2020) and https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2021 (for GLaMP 2021).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop will provide an opportunity for the dissemination and discussion of many cutting-edge results and new techniques in the study of partial differential equations related to fluid dynamics. In particular, the workshop?s participants will benefit from the make-up of the group of speakers which incorporates researches working on theoretical, numerical, and applied aspects of fluid dynamics. One of the difficulties faced by researchers in the field is that the wide range of techniques employed in the study of PDEs arising in fluid dynamics can lead to fast specialization, many times preventing researchers working on similar problems from communicating with each other. This workshop will help overcoming such barriers, assuring that the vast amount of techniques available in the field are shared among its members, and giving incentives to researchers to pursue future collaborations.

A basic consequence of the theory is that observables cannot commute with each other, and so the mathematical basis for quantum mechanics must be within a noncommutative framework. Based on this constraint, in the 1930's Murray and von Neumann provided a rigorous background for quantum mechanics using algebras of operators on a Hilbert space now called von Neumann algebras. Recently, these objects have provided a precise framework in which to study quantum computing, which has enormous potential application to breakthroughs in cryptography. Another area where von Neumann algebras have given tremendous insight is in the study of random matrices. Random matrices themselves are used in nuclear physics to model the nuclei of heavy atoms, as well as in theoretical neuroscience to describe the connections between neurons in the brain. This project will also contribute to US workforce development through diversity initiatives and training of graduate students.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to study group von Neumann algebras through two different approaches: Voiculescu's free probability theory, and Popa's deformation/rigidity theory. In Voiculescu's free probability theory, the PI plans to use the theory of random matrices to attack a well-known conjecture of Peterson and Thom on the structure of subalgebras of group von Neumann algebras of free groups. The random matrix approach uses so-called strong convergence, which demands that eigenvalue distributions converge weak*, and that the spectrum converges in the Hausdorff metric.   Building on the 1-bounded entropy theory due to the PI and Jung, the PI establishes that if a natural strong convergence results holds for tensors of random unitaries, then one is able to deduce the Peterson-Thom conjecture as a corollary. Importing insight from sofic entropy theory into Popa's deformation/rigidity theory, the PI recently showed with de Santaigo-Hoff-Sinclair that given a (s-malleable) deformation of a tracial von Neumann algebra, and a diffuse, rigid subalgebra, one can necessarily extend it to a maximal rigid subalgebra. A potential avenue for exploration is in generalizing these results to approximately rigid subalgebra. Such a generalization gives a second approach to the Peterson-Thom conjecture. It would also provide a way to show that nonamenable groups with nontrivial cohomology in the left regular representation do not have Cartan subalgebras, a problem in the subject that has been open for the last decade. The PI also plans to study the implications of this theory to the case of von Neumann algebras of equivalence relations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, shuffling a deck of cards or rotating an atom around its nucleus.  Over the last 200 years, Group Theory has been spectacularly successful in using symmetry to study a wide variety of problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  More recently, starting in the 1980s, mathematicians and mathematical physicists have developed a theory of Quantum Groups and Quantum Symmetry which adapt ideas from Group Theory to more general settings appearing in quantum physics and related mathematics.  The first spectacular application of what we now call Group Theory was Galois' use of symmetries of number systems to explain why there's a generalization of the familiar quadratic formula to solve equations using third or fourth powers, but no such formula for solving equations with fifth powers.  Galois's number systems are parallel to von Neumann factors developed to study quantum mechanics, and several of the first spectacular applications of what we would know call Quantum Groups or Quantum Symmetries appeared in Jones's study of subfactors.  More recently Quantum Symmetry has become central to certain approaches to constructing quantum computers using so-called topological phases of matter.  The main techniques used in this project involve higher dimensional algebra.  Here the idea is that we typically write mathematical symbols on a line when doing calculations, but in many settings it is better to use the whole plane to draw pictures, or to do the calculation on ""paper"" in more interesting shapes like circles or spheres.  Sometimes the geometry allows for insight into the mathematics, for example you can ""rotate"" a calculation taking place in the plane.  The goal of this project is to use higher dimensional algebra to study questions in quantum symmetry. The project will also contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of Ph.D. and high school students.<br/><br/>In more technical language, we use planar algebras, topological quantum field theory, and higher categories to study questions coming from von Neumann subfactors and tensor categories.  These include very example-driven questions like constructing and studying exceptional small index subfactors, as well as more theoretical questions like understanding the structure of the 3-category of fusion categories (where subfactors appear as 1-morphisms).  More specifically, this project focuses on four closely related research programs.  First, we will develop a purely algebraic analogue of the author's previous work on the classification of small index subfactors. Second we will use module categories more systematically to approach analytic questions about reconstructing subfactors from their standard invariants.  Third, we will use skein theoretic approaches and Jones's planar algebras to study tensor categories, including non-semisimple tensor categories.  Finally, we study tensor categories and braided tensor categories using higher-categories and local topological quantum field theories building on the Lurie-Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to analyze how some fundamental physical objects interact with fractal structures.  For instance, suppose we know that a field associated to a body in space (for instance its gravitational field) is well-behaved (say, has bounded magnitude), then what can we infer about the geometry of the body?  Does the condition upon the field preclude the surface of the body from having a fractal type structure?  A second topic considered concerns understanding signals whose frequencies have a self-similar or fractal behavior.  More precisely, one is interested in the extent to which the signal can be reconstructed uniquely from a ""small"" set of values.  The principal investigator (PI) will incorporate both graduate and undergraduate students into the research program, training them for future careers in STEM fields.  The PI will organize annual undergraduate research symposia that will bring together undergraduate students interested in mathematical research across southeastern states to present their undergraduate research, build a network with others interested in pursuing research in the mathematical sciences, and provide information about research opportunities at the graduate level.<br/><br/>This project concerns the analysis of operators when the geometry underlying the problem is rough or fractal in nature.  The first question considered is: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that a Calderon-Zygmund operator associated to it is bounded?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz submanifolds of appropriate dimension? This basic question in analysis has found applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundaries, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  Despite intense study over the last thirty years, the tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the field to the geometric structure of the measure are currently underdeveloped, something that this proposal aims to rectify.  The second question is: How sparse must the support of the Fourier transform of a function be to ensure that the function can be uniquely reconstructed by its values on a ""thick"" subset?  Although this question is a classical form of the uncertainty principle, it is not yet well understood, especially in several dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even the simplest families of examples, such as the well-studied family of quadratic polynomials, exhibit complicated dynamical features that we have yet to understand.

The quantum states or waves are described as solutions of partial differential equations and their properties are often determined by the properties of underlying classical (particle) systems. The subject has its origins in geometric optics (going back to the 17th century) and quantum mechanics (going back to the first half of the 20th century) but the numerical, experimental and mathematical advances provide a new range of challenges and research opportunities. For instance, quantum resonances, which in chemistry can describe transitional states in chemical reactions, are now more accessible experimentally, and mathematically, compared to the time when they were introduced. Quasinormal modes, which are an analogue of these resonances in general relativity now have a chance of being observed for the first time, thanks to the LIGO experiments. At the same time, the methods originally developed to study differential equations using insights from classical dynamics, are now successfully used to answer questions about chaotic systems or geometry of geodesics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Among the specific problems studied by the PI are: (1) distribution of scattering resonances for classically chaotic systems; (2) understand dynamical zeta function (generating function for periods of closed orbits in much the same way as the Riemann zeta function is a generating function of prime numbers); and (3) spectral problems arising in fluid mechanics, specifically in the formation of internal waves. The concrete problem about chaotic scattering concerns the existence of a spectral gap for any (hyperbolic) configuration of convex obstacles in the plane. Since the late 80s it was proposed in the mathematics and physics literature that the gap is determined by the ""topological pressure"" of the trapped reflected rays. Recent advances on the fractal uncertainty principle should imply that there always is a spectral gap. For dynamical zeta functions, one of the goals is to understand the Fried conjecture which proposes a relation between dynamical (value of the zeta function at 0), spectral and topological quantities (corresponding torsions) for general manifolds with chaotic flows. The microlocal tools developed, among others by the PI, are particularly promising here. Internal waves in fluids, theoretically described by spectral methods, have only been observed, in a controlled experiment, 25 years ago. The importance of viscosity and nonlinear effects (on both classical and wave level) is still to be fully understood. The PI and his collaborators made some advances here but many questions, such as the analysis of the physically relevant boundary value problems, remain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important to ?average? those small scales through suitable mathematical models (called ?homogenization?) and investigate resulting macroscopic structures (?effective quantities?) that are approximations of original systems. A particularly interesting and physically relevant question is to understand how those effective quantities depend on original physical systems. Effective Hamiltonian arises from homogenizing Hamilton-Jacobi equations, which are partial differential equations (PDE) that play fundamental roles in control theory and the modeling of things like crystal growth, flame propagations, etc. For example, effective Hamiltonian serves as an important approach to model turbulent flame speed, one of the most important quantities in turbulent combustion (e.g., the spread of wild fire fanned by strong wind, the burning inside an engine), via the popular G-equation model. One goal of this project is to understand how the turbulent flame speed depends on the strength of the flow (e.g., wind velocity) and other important physical quantities like curvature effects, which could provide theoretical justifications for phenomena observed in experiments. The curvature effect is a phenomenological way to capture variance of burning temperature along the flame front. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The first part of the project aims to identify optimal convergence rate in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As the principal investigator and his collaborators have revealed in previous works, the optimal convergence rate is closely related to the shape of corresponding effective Hamiltonian. The second and third part of the project focus on studying important properties of effective Hamiltonian from perspectives of both the mathematical interest and practical applications in turbulent combustion. Although the existence of effect Hamiltonian has been established in many situations since the fundamental work of Lions-Papanicolaou-Varadhan (1987), understanding finer properties of effective Hamiltonian remains a major open problem in homogenization theory due to limitations of standard methods in PDEs. There are deep connections between properties of effective Hamiltonian and dynamical systems. In particular, the principal investigator needs to employ substantial tools/methods from ergodic theory, Aubry-Mather theory/weak KAM theory. In addition, dynamics associated with two-person zero-sum differential games is also important in dealing with non-convex Hamiltonian and the presence of curvature term (curvature effect).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The questions that the project plans to study have applications whenever storage of three-dimensional information (landscapes, faces, human brain surface) in a two-dimensional image is desired without loss of information. While in the case of ""smooth"" objects (objects that are not modeled using fractals) the corresponding mathematical theory is well understood, this is not the case for fractal objects, which require the development of new techniques. This project aims to develop mathematical theory for such fractal spaces. Another focus of this project is the study of removable fractal sets. Fractal sets appear sometimes as boundaries of otherwise ""smooth"" objects, and for many problems it is useful to know that these fractals are removable, in the sense that their presence can be ignored for some purposes. Removability of fractal sets has applications in mathematical problems that require ""gluing"" together two functions, or two dynamical systems, or two surfaces, and could result in the better understanding of dynamical systems in physics.<br/><br/>This project consists of three parts, concerning the uniformization of Sierpinski carpets, the uniformization of two-dimensional metric surfaces, and the problem of removability of fractal sets for conformal maps.

The PI will also work in questions related to Hausdorff dimension distortion under the uniformizing map and in generalizations of this planar uniformization theory to abstract Sierpinski carpets. Another focus is the problem of uniformization of two-dimensional metric surfaces. In this direction, the PI will investigate possible generalizations of uniformization theorems for two-dimensional surfaces by Euclidean space and concentrate efforts on weakening the existing geometric assumptions. Finally, the PI will work on extending earlier results on the removability of fractal sets, by finding topological criteria for fractal sets (resembling the Sierpinski gasket or carpet) to be non-removable, studying the equivalence of Sobolev removability and conformal removability, and exploring the connections of removability to the problem of rigidity of circle domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A principal goal of this project is to understand, in a quantitative way, how the geometry of a region influences the conduction of heat through the region, and across its boundary. This project will contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The project has three main areas of focus: 1) the Neumann Problem. The PI plans to solve the Neumann problem for Laplace's equation, with p-integrable data, in domains satisfying a quantitative, scale invariant version of a measure theoretic condition which is equivalent to the existence of a measure-theoretic outer unit normal at almost every boundary point; thus, the condition is natural for the Neumann problem, and may be sharp. Eventually, the PI seeks to characterize geometrically the domains in which such solvability is possible. 2) Parabolic quantitative rectifiability. At present, the theory of quantitative rectifiability in the time-evolutive parabolic setting is quite rudimentary in comparison to the rich theory available in the steady-state elliptic setting.  In recent work of the PI and co-authors, elliptic quantitative rectifiability has played a central role in the characterization of those domains for which the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation is solvable. The PI expects that the proposed work would be a first step towards an analogous characterization in the parabolic case. 3) The Kato square root problem for non-divergence form elliptic operators.  The solution of the square root problem for divergence form elliptic operators has enabled significant progress in the theory of boundary value problems for divergence form equations.  As a first step towards opening up the analogous theory in the non-divergence setting, the PI proposes to treat the Kato problem for non-divergence elliptic operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to understand which universal mechanisms explain that transition, and how one can describe systems that operate in a region between order and complete chaos, where the complexity is maximal. In other words, the goal is to understand the processes by which a system evolves from periodic toward chaotic behavior as one or more parameters governing the behavior of the system are varied. This has only been understood in low dimensional dynamics (which are as simple as a system involving one variable). The present project presents a novel approach that allows us to move away from those limitations.

The project will also support the training of graduate students, directly involved in this research.<br/><br/><br/>The current project presents a tentative global framework toward describing a large class of area contracting surface dynamics of the disc with zero and low entropy, inspired partially by the developments in the one-dimensional theory of interval maps.

Examples include the equations for fluid flows or the equation describing the distribution of stress in various structures. In practice, the equations are often solved with the use of computers and a good theoretical understanding of the equations is important for finding effective algorithms. At present, our theoretical understanding of many PDEs is incomplete. There is an important difference between linear models (for which our understanding is better) and non-linear models. In linear models, the reaction of the system to a disturbance is, roughly speaking, proportional to the disturbance. In non-linear models, this is not the case, and many of the mathematical difficulties can be traced to this effect. Linear regimes are often relevant for small disturbances from equilibria, whereas large disturbances are often governed by non-linear phenomena. This project will focus on the non-linear phenomena. In particular, one of the most serious effects in the class of equations which will be investigated is the formation of singularities and the related loss of predictive power of the equations. This will be studied in the context of fundamental equations (such as the equations of incompressible fluid mechanics) and also for various model equations, which can provide suitable stepping stones towards making progress on difficult open problems. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the project focuses on the following areas: (i) One-dimensional models exhibiting features of PDEs of fluid mechanics. These include the De Gregorio model (which can be thought of as an extension of the Constantin-Lax-Majda model), equations modeling boundary behavior of 2d systems, and vector-valued Burgers-type equations. In spite of their simplicity, such models can be a good source of ideas and their improved understanding can lead to progress on the fundamental equations. In fact, ideas going back to these models have already proved important in the context of the full three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations; (ii) Equations arising in physics and geometry for which we have a satisfactory chance of obtaining a fairly good understanding. These include the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, the 2d harmonic map heat flow, and some classical non-linear elliptic systems arising from multi-dimensional variational integrals for vector-valued functions. (The last theme has connections to non-linear elasticity.) All these are important equations in their own right and the PI believes that some of the long-standing open problems related to them can be successfully addressed; (iii) Approachable aspects of the full equations of the incompressible fluid dynamics (the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations). This includes investigations of the solvability of equations describing generalized self-similar singularities, relations between possible non-uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf solutions and questions about instabilities, the stability of the double exponential growth for 2d Euler near the boundaries, and other issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are intriguing for both their aesthetic appeal and for the fact that despite their high complexity they often arise as the result of very simple mechanisms. On the mathematical side, such structures arise when repeatedly applying a simple rule such as a quadratic polynomial. In nature and in statistical physics models, very similar patterns and shapes emerge from randomness. The Principal Investigator's research is mostly concerned with two-dimensional fractals that possess some form of scale and rotation invariance, both in the deterministic and in the random setting. Using methods from complex analysis, the principal investigator and his students will work towards answering foundational questions and an understanding of why the deterministic and random patterns are so similar. The project also supports the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>Conformally self-similar two-dimensional sets can often be described through conformal welding. Conformal welding is the process of gluing two Riemann surfaces along their boundaries to form a new surface. It is instrumental in Teichmueller theory, of independent interest in geometric function theory, and has recently been intensely studied in the context of the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) and Liouville Quantum Gravity (LQG). The PI will explore the recently found connections between Teichmueller theory and Loewner theory. He will apply his new conditions on weldability to the setting of SLE and LQG, aiming at an analytic construction of SLE by gluing quantum discs.

The goal is to understand how topological solitons influence the dynamics, and to resolve two long-standing, open questions. First, the investigator will try to prove that nonlinear waves can be uniquely continued past a singularity that develops in finite time by concentrating energy (bubbling) in a soliton. Second, the investigator seeks to show that multi-soliton collisions are necessarily inelastic for non-integrable wave equations such as the phi-4 scalar field model and the wave maps equation.

Today, the study of Laplace eigenfunctions is a fast developing field which lies on the intersection of the theory of partial differential equations, differential geometry, and spectral theory. Numerous connections to other areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, ergodic theory and number theory make this field attractive to researches with various backgrounds. The principal investigator (PI) plans to continue working on a number of longstanding problems on behavior of Laplace eigenfunctions on compact manifolds and solutions to elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), using local techniques and methods that already led to a number of interesting results. One of those is called quantitative unique continuation. The PI's research on quantitative properties of solutions of elliptic PDEs has numerous applications in other areas of mathematics, including nodal geometry, geometric measure theory, and mathematical physics. A number of research problems for current and prospective graduate students are formulated in the project. The PI is active in disseminating the results obtained as part of this project through series of lectures and mini-courses. One of the goals of the project is to support activities that introduce junior researchers with various backgrounds to the theory of Laplace eigenfunctions. The PI is committed to encouraging full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, promoting diversity in academia. <br/> <br/>Recent progress in the understanding of the behavior of the doubling index of harmonic functions and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator led to a proof of Nadirashvili's conjecture and a partial solution of Yau's conjecture. The PI will continue to collaborate with A. Logunov on problems related to Yau's conjecture. In particular, they plan to study the nodal sets of the Dirichlet-Laplace eigenfunctions on domains on manifolds with smooth Riemannian metric and on surfaces with smooth metric. In many questions, Laplace eigenfunctions behave as polynomials of a corresponding power. For example, Donnelly and Fefferman proved that the vanishing order of an eigenfunction is bounded by a multiple of the square root of the eigenvalue. The PI and A. Logunov showed that the BMO norm of the logarithm of an eigenfunction is bounded by the same quantity. The PI will continue to study this analogy; one of the open problems is to obtain dimension-free Bernstein's inequalities for eigenfunctions, generalizing results of Donnelly and Fefferman. Local methods developed to study eigenfunctions are connected to more general problems on the properties of solutions of second order PDE. The PI plans to continue this research, first addressing questions of quantitative propagation of smallness for the gradients of solutions. Another goal of the project is to study the order of vanishing of solutions to Schrodinger's equation with bounded potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some well-known examples where wavelets are a key tool include the JPEG 2000 digital image standard and fingerprint compression for data storage. The broader impacts of this project include education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the area of harmonic analysis and wavelets.<br/><br/>This project aims to answer some of the most fundamental questions in wavelet and frame theory. One of the main research directions of the project is the development of techniques for the construction of well-localized orthogonal wavelets for large classes of non-isotropic expanding dilations. A closely related complementary topic is the study of wavelets for non-expanding dilations. The problem of characterizing dilations for which there exist minimally supported frequency (MSF) wavelets is connected to the geometry of numbers; more specifically, to the estimate on the number of lattice points of dilates of balls. An analogous problem of classifying dilations for which there exist well-localized wavelets has implications in the study of non-isotropic function spaces. Another direction of the project is the construction of frames with certain desired properties, such as prescribed norms and frame operator. This line of research is closely related to infinite dimensional generalizations of the Schur-Horn theorem. The problem of characterizing diagonals of self-adjoint operators not only has implications for frame theory, it has also been studied extensively in the setting of von Neumann algebras.

As this field of study has grown, it has expanded to include more general types of systems that, rather than changing with time, are transformed by more general groups of symmetries. This would apply, for instance, to the study of information spread over a large and highly regular network. In this general form, dynamical systems has significant connections to other branches of mathematics and science, such as number theory, geometry, combinatorics, statistical physics, operator algebras, and data science. One fundamental tool in the study of dynamical systems is the concept of entropy, which is a measurement of how chaotic or unpredictable a system is. This notion was first introduced in 1958 by Kolmogorov in the case of time transformations but was soon after extended to systems with an amenable group of transformations, i.e. systems where boundary phenomena are mostly inconsequential. For systems having a non-amenable group of transformations, the concept of entropy was formalized only a decade ago. This new terrain of entropy theory is still in its early stages and has not yet become as well understood or as powerful a tool as in classical settings. The goal of this project, broadly speaking, is to further the development of entropy theory in the context of non-amenable groups so that it may become a widely applicable tool like its classical version.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to improve our understanding of entropy and widen its scope of applications. In particular, the principal investigator intends to address whether sofic entropy and Rokhlin entropy coincide for principal algebraic actions of sofic groups, to investigate whether tailed-percolation entropy is a lower bound to sofic entropy, and to determine whether completely-positive-entropy actions are uniformly mixing. Historically, the most potent applications of entropy theory have been to the study of Bernoulli shifts. Specifically, entropy played a significant role in the development of Ornstein theory - a theory that completely characterized and classified Bernoulli shifts over countable amenable groups up to isomorphism. In recent work, the principal investigator established a generalization of Sinai's factor theorem to all countably infinite groups. As part of this project, the PI plans to utilize and expand upon this recent work to make initial steps towards an Ornstein theory. As part of this goal, the principal investigator plans to further generalize Sinai's factor theorem to the settings of f-invariant entropy and naive entropy, to study the properties of finitely determined processes, to investigate whether the high temperature Ising model over the rank 2 free group is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift, to determine when Popa factors of Bernoulli shifts are isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts, and to investigate the orbit equivalence class of Bernoulli shifts over free groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, a new set of ideas and techniques are needed to strike a delicate balance between the known theory for the homogeneous situation and the one related to the oscillating phenomena. The dynamics of liquid crystals that are widely used in display devices will also be studied. This involves fascinating and diffcult theoretical questions that deal with the nonlinear coupling of fluid dynamical equations and flows of certain geometric objects that may lead to a new direction of research.

A tremendous amount of knowledge has been accumulated on this topic under the general theory of (periodic and stochastic) homogenization. However, there are many interesting and deep open problems such as those related to quantitative (for both large and small scales) unique continuations, uniform and exact controllability of evolution problems, and stability estimates on the related inverse problems in such highly oscillatory medium. The second set of problems are a continuation of the PI's earlier studies on the hydrodynamics of liquid crystals with an emphasis on the exploration of the underlying nonlinear coupling structure. Of particular interest are global existence of suitable weak solutions in 3D and the existence of finite time blow ups in 2D for the Ericksen-Leslie system.

This project is a mathematical analysis of certain topological dynamical systems via C*-algebra theory. C*-algebras are infinite dimensional linear algebras. The project is an attempt to use a few computable data to determine the structure of certain C*-algebras arising from the dynamical systems. The project also studies closely related C*-algebra theory which will be used in the computation of data generated by dynamical systems. The success of the project would reveal the deep internal relationship between the theory of dynamical systems and theory of C*-algebras and pave the way for further applications of these theories.<br/><br/>The project may also be described as a study of theoretical applications of the classification of simple amenable C*-algebras to the study of topological dynamical systems. The central goal of the project is to use K-theory related data to analyze the structure of minimal dynamical systems and to develop new general methods to compute K-theory related groups for separable amenable C*-algebras. Let G be a group acting on a compact metric space X. The algebra of continuous functions on X together with the group action generate a crossed product C*-algebra. One specific problem that the project will study is to determine when two such actions are asymptotically conjugate. Closely related problems include the study of automorphisms on C*-algebras. It is proposed to use K-theory and KK-theory as well as tracial information to characterize the group actions. Methods developed in the theory of classification of simple amenable C*-algebras will be further enriched. Moreover new bridges between dynamical systems and C*-algebra theory will be built. The project will also study irreducible representations of certain simple C*-algebras. It is the proposer's long term goal to provide, from this project and related research as well as via related studies by other researchers, some deeper theoretical understandings and wider applications of C*-algebra theory and its interplay with the study of dynamical systems to various other related research areas, such as ergodic theory, non-commutative homotopy theory, abstract harmonic analysis, as well as physics and biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to combine tools including deformation-rigidity theory, ergodic embeddings, approximation and simulation techniques, and reconstruction methods to study rigidity in factors and to tackle several longstanding questions in this area.  Rigidity results can be relevant to many areas of mathematics and its applications, including computer science, complexity theory, quantum information theory, the design of computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes.

This work developed several important techniques to study II1 factors: finite dimensional approximation and reconstruction methods in subfactor theory, deformation rigidity theory, intertwining by bimodules, and incremental patching.

Inverse wave problems investigated in this project have immediate applications in photoacoustic and thermoacoustic tomography and will contribute to the advancement of new medical imaging methods with significant potential in clinical applications. Medical imaging methods are crucial for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. Undergraduate students, and high school students from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds will benefit from the proposed research, educational, and outreach plans. <br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) aims to study symmetry and uniqueness of solutions of mean field type equations by developing new functional inequalities in the spirit of the Sphere Covering Inequality. The Sphere Covering Inequality was recently discovered by the PI and his collaborator and has since led to solutions for several open problems. The PI will develop singular versions of the sphere covering inequality as well as inequalities with improved constants on non-simply connected regions, and extend such inequalities to higher dimensions. The project has important applications to various problems including Nirenberg's problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on the sphere, Moser-Trudinger inequalities, self-dual and Chern-Simons gauge field theories, rigidity of Hawking mass in general relativity, Keller-Segal type free boundary models for cell mobility, Onsager's vortex theory, Toda systems, and cosmic string equations. In the second part of the project, the PI will investigate the inverse problem of determining both the sources of a wave and its speed inside a medium from the measurements of the solutions of the wave equation on the boundary, which is a long-standing open problem and has important applications in medical imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first question considered is to what extent can the geometry of a body be determined from information about a force field associated to the body (for instance its gravitational field)?  Such inverse problems in potential theory have a rich history, but the mathematical tools needed to answer this question are currently underdeveloped.  The investigation will focus especially on what can be said if one only knows that the field has bounded magnitude, which is of particular interest in applications.  A second question to be explored is how, and to what degree of accuracy, can one determine the asymptotic (or long term) behavior of a random function that evolves with time, based on certain empirical measurements?<br/> <br/>More specifically, the principal investigator proposes to research several questions concerning the relationship between the geometrical properties of a measure and the regularity properties of an associated operator. The primary question of interest is the following: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that singular integral operator associated to it has good regularity properties?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz sub-manifolds of appropriate dimension? Attempts to solve this problem has led to theory which has found recent applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundary problems, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  The principal investigator intends to further develop tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the singular integral operator to the geometric structure of the measure. A second topic of research concerns understanding the long-term behavior of a stationary Gaussian process given information about its spectral measure, building upon recent work involving the principal investigator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A complete mathematical understanding of these systems is useful in addressing biological and engineering problems of mechanical nature, as it allows investigators to obtain analytical predictions on the implied consequences of physical theories motivated by such systems. At the same time, obtaining such predictions requires one to address hard mathematical challenges, which stimulates the growth and development of new and useful mathematical tools and methods, thus advancing the field of mathematics as well. The project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>A first series of questions addressed in this project concern the use of minimal surfaces as models for liquid films at equilibrium. The classical idealization of liquid films as two-dimensional surfaces cannot account for liquid films properties where the thickness of the film plays a crucial role (e.g., the relation between the stability of a given geometric film configuration and the size of the diameter of the film itself). This project intends to develop a model for liquid films as three-dimensional regions with a small volume, which was recently proposed by the principal investigator and his collaborators, and which is capable of explaining physical features not accessible by classical approaches. A second direction of investigation includes rigidity theorems for minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces possessing physically meaningful singularities. This project investigates the possibility of systematically developing them into quantitative almost-rigidity statements, and of extending their applicability to non-smooth settings, with motivations in the description of equilibrium configurations in capillarity theory and in the asymptotic behavior of extrinsic curvature flows. Finally, the vast reach of this circle of ideas naturally leads to an investigation of related problems for isoperimetric clusters, fractional perimeters and fractional mean curvatures, and for geometric flows and equilibrium shapes in diffused interface models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is closely related to the solution of the Plateau problem, which requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given shape in space. This problem is a classical question in the Calculus of Variations. The area is an energy functional, and the expectation is that minimizing it will lead to a stable configuration. In this project the PI addresses questions concerning the minimization of certain energy functionals that take into account noise and small random fluctuations of the phenomena being modeled. The expectation is that this theory will be better suited to reflect actual minimization questions arising in nature. A fundamental feature of the area functional is that it is invariant under rotations of space (if that space is homogeneous). The PI will address geometric and analytic questions in inhomogeneous and crystal-like spaces providing a model that reflects nature more accurately. This project will contribute to US workforce development through training and mentoring of graduate students and post-docs.<br/> <br/>One of the PI?s goals is to show that ?almost minimizers?, which are minimizers to noisy variational problems inherit some of the properties of minimizers of the same functional without noise. This study requires using tools from calculus of variations, harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. The expectation is that the new ideas developed along the way will find applications in other variational problems with free boundaries. The aim of the project concerning further developing analysis on non-smooth domains is to characterize the geometry of domains in Euclidean space in terms of the properties of solutions to canonical (anisotropic) operators.

High-dimensional probability is proposed as a natural framework for the mathematical exploration of deep learning. This project has a double benefit. On the one hand, it is aimed at theoretically explaining the successes of deep learning. On the other hand, the project will inspire future theoretical developments in high-dimensional probability, especially in random matrix theory.

A unifying theme of most of the problems in this proposal is nonlinear random matrix theory, where random matrices are transformed by a nonlinearity, which alters their spectral and geometric behavior. Nonlinearities empower neural networks and quantizers, underlie the concepts of random Boolean threshold functions, random tensors and geometric graphs.

The mathematical discipline of matrix analysis can be used to simplify or better understand questions about such inequalities. This project will continue the development of the systematic manipulation of matrix inequalities and study related mathematical questions in several complex variables, many of which are of independent theoretical interest.

Recent development of the subject has concerned the study of free noncommutative functions, the natural class of functions used to perform such manipulations in a dimension-free way. A qualitative understanding of the free noncommutative functional calculus is important for applications; it is a tool to work around the fact that matrix calculations, such as inversion and multiplication, are computationally expensive and sometimes unstable. Much of the study applies techniques developed in systems and control engineering, such as realization theory and sums of squares, whose mathematical theory is currently undergoing a rapid development.

The project provides research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more concrete terms, the investigator will perform research on spin glass, interacting particle systems, and random growth models with a focus on the fluctuations of large systems. In particular, the investigator will study the free energy and overlaps of the two-spin spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with critically-tuned external field, the random field for periodic KPZ universality class, and also the last passage time for a class of directed percolation models. There are deep connections to random matrix theory which the investigator will utilize and also expand.

The principal investigator will continue to maintain an intellectual environment fostering student involvement and development, providing the students with the skills, experience, and confidence to successfully pursue a career in the mathematical sciences. Thus, the project will yield both new, impactful mathematical results, as well as highly trained mathematicians prepared to join the scientific and educational workforce crucial to this nation.<br/>   <br/>Many questions in system and control theory, filter design, signal and image processing come down to function theoretic questions. The case of several variables is a highly active research area where the techniques of multivariable operator theory are highly effective.

The precise rate at which the sampling needs to be done to guarantee stable recovery depends crucially on the band-limited nature of the signal.

The settings for these problems involve geometric manifolds of dimension two or more.  Associated to a given manifold are fundamental objects called eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it emits.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and the project aims to study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the resulting eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the PI also wishes to study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity. The PI will be supervising graduate students in domains related to the proposed research. Such activities will be supported by the award.<br/><br/>Among the specific problems to be studied, the project aims to obtain improved estimates that measure the size and concentration of eigenfunctions.  In order to do this, the PI will develop what could be called ""global harmonic analysis"", which is a mixture of classical harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis and techniques from geometry.  The basic estimates to have in mind are Lp-estimates for eigenfunctions and quasimodes, and related highly localized L2 estimates that are sensitive to concentration.  The main questions center around how the geometry and the global dynamics of the geodesic flow affects the estimates and the kinds of functions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much studied (but still not well understood) questions of concentration, oscillation and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  These questions are also naturally linked to the long-time properties of the solution operator for the wave equation, Schrodinger equation and resolvent estimates coming from the metric Laplacian.

While the theory of linear wave equations predicts that waves spread out and decay as time goes by, once nonlinear effects are taken into account, this changes drastically. In particular, linear and nonlinear effects may balance out to create so-called soliton solutions, whose shapes persist and refuse to disperse. It is widely believed that solutions to most nonlinear wave and dispersive equations with ""generic"" initial data should eventually decompose into a finite number of solitons plus a radiative term that goes to zero. This project concentrates on two themes that play an important role in the quest to understand this grand picture how waves propagate overtime. The principal investigator (PI) will develop new methods and techniques for the study of the asymptotic stability of solitons in the presence of strong nonlinear interactions. Asymptotic stability refers to the phenomenon that if a soliton gets pushed a little bit, it may wiggle for a while, but ultimately return to a form similar to the one it began with.

The class of integrable systems includes several fundamental equations of nature, and the mathematical foundations of integrable systems go back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and Poincare. In our days, the theory of integrable systems has become an expanding area which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for the study of some of the fundamental mathematical models arising in modern nonlinear science and technology. In addition to the traditional domain of differential equations, integrable techniques are becoming common in such diverse fields as orthogonal polynomials, string theory, enumerative topology, statistical mechanics, random processes, quantum informatics, and number theory. Many of the problems considered in this project have direct connections with these disciplines. The project also includes several educational activities such as training of Ph.D. students at IUPUI and co-organizing of the international research/educational program on universality and integrability in random matrix theory which will be held in the Fall of 2021 at MSRI, Berkeley.<br/><br/>This project continuous the PI?s long term research efforts in the theory of integrable systems. The principal goal of this research program is to address various new analytical questions of the theory of integrable systems which have emerged from recent developments in random matrix theory and in the theory of exactly solvable quantum models. In this project, the PI will concentrate on three directions of research: (a) The general beta-ensembles and the Calogero-Painleve system; (b) The study of the isomonodromic tau functions, their asymptotics, Fredholm determinant representations and their relations to conformal field theory; and (c) The asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz + Hankel determinants emerging from random matrix theory and statistical mechanics. Each of these directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems, and they will be investigated within the same analytical framework, viz., the Riemann-Hilbert method. Success in part (a) of the project would have a notable impact in the development of the general concept of universality and integrability in  both the random matrix theory and in the theory of interacting particles as well as in the modern nonlinear science at large. The part (b) of the project will further enhance the ""nonlinear special function"" status of Painleve transcendences, which are also sometimes called ""the Special Functions of 21st century"".

Coherent structures, such as vortices (eddies) and shear flows, are prominent features in fluid dynamics. The formation, stability, and evolution of coherent structures are critical fluid phenomena to understand in order to reduce drag, oscillation, and instability in scientific and engineering applications. The PI will develop new, innovative mathematical methods to analyze the dynamic properties of physically important coherent structures, which can resolve theoretical difficulties as well as provide powerful mathematical tools for practical applications. The PI will also study the interaction of radiation and particles in the context of wave maps, which have a deep connection to the classical field theories from mathematical physics. The proposed projects provide an ideal training ground for junior researchers in applying cutting edge mathematical analysis to study sophisticated physical phenomena in fluid dynamics and wave propagation.

Roughly speaking, this field keeps track of the position and frequency, or momentum, of waves (or more generally, functions) simultaneously. The planned applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as inverse problems for determining a function from integrals along curves (X-ray transform) and related problems for determining the structure of a material from boundary measurements. Although the proposal concerns their mathematical theory, these problems are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with electromagnetic waves, such as light, being one of the most prevalent examples. The theory of general relativity is another important physical example via (the not long ago detected) gravitational waves: the PI?s recent work with Hintz showed that in a universe with a (possibly small, as our universe is currently understood) positive cosmological constant, perturbations of black holes decay to a slightly different black hole, emitting gravitational waves in the process. Scattering theory of quantum particles (such as protons and electrons) is another subject governed by microlocal analysis: these aspects enter both into the description of quantum waves at large distances. The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance: an application of the theory developed here is the determination of an unknown variable speed of elastic waves in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, which for instance is relevant to imaging to interior of Earth using the travel times of earthquake waves. Many of the projects are suitable for research by doctoral students, and the PI strives to contribute to the education of a new generation of mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>Some of the proposed projects describe the long-time or far field behavior of waves on curved space-times. Physically these arise in general relativity, including electromagnetic waves on a curved background. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in the PI's work on linear and non-linear (with his former PhD student, P. Hintz) problems on asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) spaces as well as Kerr-de Sitter (KdS) space (rotating black holes in a cosmological spacetime), culminating in the proof of the stability of slowly rotating KdS spaces with Hintz. More recently, with Hafner and Hintz the PI extended some of these tools to the vanishing cosmological constant case (Minkowski, Kerr). The projects here aim to extend these tools to further spaces, such as perturbations of Kerr spacetimes, and also to study other equations on cosmological spacetimes. Other projects study basic objects in quantum field theory, in particular the Feynman propagator. Another main area is inverse problems, where the PI, together with Uhlmann, has introduced new tools for the spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform, and with Stefanov and Uhlmann extended this to the boundary rigidity problem. One project here aims to extend this to anisotropic elasticity which plays an important role in the interior of the Earth.

The famous Atiyah-Singer index theorem computes the Fredholm index of these differential equations when the manifold is compact. This theorem has numerous applications to geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. If one takes symmetries into consideration, then there is a much more refined invariant of the differential equation called the higher index. When the higher index vanishes, a new subtle higher secondary invariant naturally arises. These new invariants have powerful applications to mathematics and physics. The PI and his students plan to study these invariants and their applications. This project will contribute to US workforce development through mentoring of graduate and post-doctoral students.<br/><br/>The higher invariants of differential equations or operators live in K-theory of certain geometric operator algebras in the context of noncommutative geometry. It remains a major challenge to compute these higher invariants. Part of the underlying difficulty comes from the lack of understanding for the universe of groups, which plays the role of symmetries here. The PI and his students intend to devise new methods to compute these higher invariants and apply these computations to solve problems in analysis, differential geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A main goal of this project is to study a particular class of these equations that can be used to model the behavior of vibrations of a drum or an inhomogeneous material, the temperature distribution of a thermal conductor, or the distribution of the random motion of particles moving in a region of fluid. Other than in a few simple model cases, this behavior is still far from understood. By reformulating these problems in terms of partial differential equations, this project will study this behavior. One particular question of interest is how does the shape of a drum influence which part of the drum its vibrations are typically localized to. Another aim is to study free boundary problems. A free boundary is the region separating two different materials, such as the interface between water and the air in the ocean or between an insulating material and the air. The free boundary can be modeled via solving differential equations, and understanding its shape and the scale at which it appears smooth has applications to optimal shape design, electromagnetism, and fluid flow. This project contributes to the development of the US workforce through mentoring of undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>In this project, the PI will study eigenvalues and eigenfunctions on convex domains in Euclidean space and the sphere. A main goal of the project is to further the understanding of the level sets of the eigenfunction. The starting point is a quantitative property, namely the convexity of the level sets, and the aim is to use and develop techniques from elliptic and differential geometry theory to establish quantitative properties involving their shape and location with the domain. This would lead to understanding the region of the domain where the eigenfunctions localize in cases where no explicit formulae are available. Another part of the project involves variants of the classical Friedland-Hayman inequality concerning eigenvalues on the sphere. This will involve developing tools from convex geometry, isoperimetric inequality theory, and Brenier's optimal transportation mappings. This will be applied to prove regularity properties of minimizers of associated free boundary problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2021 and 2022 it will alternate between different colleges and universities in the Carolinas and Georgia; the location is determined at the previous conference. The topics of the conference are in the modern theory of dynamical systems. This is an area of mathematics that has had applications in computer science, cryptography, data analysis, physics, and biology and uses a variety of different branches of mathematics including analysis, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, and rigorous computation. This conference is important because it is the basis of much of the dynamical systems community in the Southeast. Many attendees come each year to continue ongoing collaborations, begin new projects, and hear from experts in the field. In addition to the traditional lively interaction among mathematicians from the Southeast there have been hour talks by invited leaders in the field from outside the region. The Carolina Dynamics Symposia feature one participant who will deliver a public lecture on the Friday before the conference begins, as well as about three hour-long plenary participants giving lectures during the conference weekend. All meetings will also have twenty-minute to thirty-minute contributed talks, and invited talks. A significant number of talks are given by (graduate) students and young researchers. The conferences have led to successful research projects and publications in the past. This continues a very successful model with participants of diverse levels and backgrounds, among those a particularly large number of female participants and organizers.<br/><br/>Participants of the Carolina Dynamics Symposium include mathematicians at all levels: senior and junior faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates. The range of topics is broad, including more theoretical areas such as symbolic, complex, and topological dynamics, ergodic theory, and geometry, as well as more applied areas such as celestial mechanics, differential equations, numerical methods, mathematical biology, and rigorous computation. More specifically, some recent topics include complexity of subshifts, entropy, odometers in a variety of settings, mixing properties, substitutions, Bratteli-Vershik systems, cellular automata, and 3 body problems.

This is a result of a growing number of possible configurations as well as a lack of intuition, which is primarily built on low-dimensional examples. Sometimes, due to certain underlying fundamental properties such as symmetry or independence of these objects, we witness an order and universality present in high dimensions. This project aims to deepen our mathematical understanding of such phenomena in several contexts, such as volumetric aspects of high-dimensional random polytopes (geometric objects with ""flat"" sides), or the sums of many random quantities in which each quantity comes with a deterministic weight. In addition to their fundamental interest, such problems are motivated by, and often find applications in, related areas of statistics, computer science, big data and machine learning. A vital part of this project is the student training and educational activities that will result. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project is devoted to three topics related to analytic, geometric and probabilistic aspects of high-dimensional phenomena: estimates for moments and tails of sums of random variables, thresholds for the volume of random polytopes, and efficient coverings of convex sets with its homothetic copies (the Hadwiger covering/illumination problem). Our work on probabilistic comparison inequalities, involving analytic and probabilistic techniques such as chaining, will help us understand the concentration of measure phenomena for random sums, with applications to the geometry of Banach spaces. Volume threshold phenomena of random polytopes in high dimensions have been established and satisfactorily understood only in the presence of a product structure or rotational symmetry. The lack of these two in our problems creates a need for new, more robust techniques and approaches. The illumination conjecture touches upon very basic concepts: coverings and intersections of convex sets.

Complex analysis in one variable is a mature and beautiful subject. It has broad applications to various branches of mathematics and physics, including algebra (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra), topology (Riemann Mapping Theorem), number theory (Prime Number Theorem), fluid mechanics, optics and electrostatics (Conformal Mappings).  Holomorphic functions in several complex variables were studied more recently, in the past one hundred years. Function theory in several complex variables is fundamentally different from the theory of one complex variable. Its development has influenced modern analysis in partial differential equations, harmonic analysis and complex geometry.  The results of the project will have wide appeal to a large section of the mathematics community. It has already found applications in modern technologies that involve non-smooth boundaries such as electrospray and scattering. The principal investigator is engaged in the development of a textbook on one complex variable theory for partial differential equations to make these interesting topics more accessible to a wide range of students not just in mathematics, but also in physical sciences and engineering. The project provides training opportunities for graduate students and the principal investigator  is actively involved in teaching and training students at all levels.<br/>       <br/>The goal of the project is to explore several diverse and interconnected areas in several complex variables. The focus is on two of the most important equations in several complex variables: the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.  Classical results on these equations require that the domains have smooth boundary, or the ambient spaces are Euclidean or Stein.  A large part of the project is on domains with non-smooth boundary and on complex manifolds.  The principal investigator has initiated the study of the Cauchy-Riemann equations on Lipschitz domains using harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory.  The problems include the Hausdorff property of Dolbeault cohomology groups, Levi-flat hypersurfaces and complex foliation, Runge approximation and function theory on non-smooth domains and complex manifolds.

The purpose of this project is to build a new theoretical foundation for the hypoelliptic Laplacian, and then develop its applications in harmonic analysis and elsewhere.  Expected outcomes will include a clearer and deeper overall understanding of the the hypoelliptic Laplacian, and a broadening of the range of applications to which it may be applied.

Turning to applications, in principle the hypoelliptic Laplacian offers a new approach to Harish-Chandra's Plancherel formula for real reductive groups, and an early priority will be to explore this application further.

A fundamental feature of quantum mechanics is that if you perform a measurement on a physical system, it has the effect of permanently altering the state of the system.  This means that the order in which one performs measurements on certain physical systems matters.  In this context, we say that measurement is ""non-commutative"".  The inherent non-commutativity of quantum mechanics is described by the theory of operator algebras, which is the branch of mathematics that investigates how to efficiently manipulate and encode arbitrarily large matrices of numerical data.  Today,  operator algebras and quantum theory are both well-established and independent branches of the mathematical sciences. However, in recent years, with the advent of quantum computation and quantum information science, there has been a resurgence of fruitful interactions between the more mathematical theory of operator algebras and the more physical theory of quantum mechanics.  The primary goal of this project is to explore and deepen the emerging connections between operator algebra theory and quantum information theory (QIT).  The central objects of study in this project are quantized symmetries in operator algebras and QIT.  Understanding the symmetries of systems has long been a powerful tool in mathematical and physical problems, and the highly non-commutative nature of both operator algebras and QIT naturally leads to the discovery of more flexible notions of symmetries, called quantum symmetries.  In this project, we will use various mathematical incarnations of quantum symmetries to provide a link between operator algebra theory and QIT, and we will use this link to provide new insights into both of these important fields. This project will contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project breaks up into two main directions. The first direction concerns the structural theory of some new and interesting classes of operator algebras arising from quantum isomorphism spaces.  Quantum isomorphism spaces appear naturally in the study of quantum teleportation and super-dense coding schemes in QIT, and also in the representation theory of quantum permutation groups.  The study of these algebras leads us to propose a quantum analogue of Lueck?s determinant conjecture from geometric group theory and investigate its potential applications to constructing new examples of strongly 1-bounded and strongly solid von Neumann algebras. The second direction of this project relates to the Principal Investigator's pioneering work on the interactions between quantum symmetries and QIT. Here, geometric and representation-theoretic tools will be used to find applications of non-local games arising in QIT to the construction of new examples of hyperlinear discrete quantum groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Usually data is endowed with a natural distance or metric (degree of dissimilarity) of its elements. One of the useful approaches to analysis of such sets of data is to use some low-distortion embeddings of the set into a space whose structure is well-known; for example, into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. The more general spaces considered are called Banach spaces. After that one can use many algorithms available in computational geometry and many tools from classical parts of mathematics such as Calculus.  If a low-distortion embedding into a plane is available, one can even visualize the structure of the set; for example, it is possible to see its clusters. Another application of embeddings is to construction of approximate algorithms. This means that in cases where the algorithms for finding the exact solution of a combinatorial optimization problem are not practical (i.e., consume too much time) we are looking not for the optimal solution, but for a solution close (in one or another sense) to being optimal. In many cases, the best known approximate algorithms for exact solutions are based on metric embeddings. The main goal of this project is to study embeddings of discrete metric spaces into Banach spaces. Such embeddings form a well-established tool in Theoretical Computer Science and Topology. <br/><br/>The existence of a low-distortion embedding into a plane is rather rare in applications. In many contexts, weaker types of embeddings are still useful, and even embeddings into high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional Banach spaces lead to important results. The PI will study embeddings of discrete metric spaces into Banach spaces. This project will contribute to the following general problem: Find new classes of embeddings of finite and locally finite metric spaces into Banach spaces and find new types of obstructions to such embeddings. The main directions of proposed work are: 1. Study relations between embeddability into different classes of Banach spaces, expansion, and girth of graphs. 2. Study geometric properties of transportation cost spaces, known to contain isometrically metric spaces on which they are built. 3. Find characterizations of well-known classes of Banach spaces in terms of embeddings. 4. Study relations between embeddability of metric spaces and embeddability of their parts. The methods are expected to be a mixture of methods of geometric functional analysis and graph theory, with occasional usage of methods of probability theory and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Related questions such as variable coefficient analogues and averaging operators over degenerate manifolds will also be studied. The research will also investigate regularity properties of those maximal functions for functions in first order Sobolev spaces. This connects with the second theme of this project, establishing endpoint Sobolev regularity properties of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function and its fractional counterpart. The techniques here are non-Fourier analytic.

A central theme is to explore problems which have known applications to the mathematics underpinning models for physical materials called quasicrystals. The research goals are to use tools from number theory, probability, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory, to prove new results about a number of long standing open problems with significance in the world of pure mathematics, which also have the potential for real world applications. The Principal Investigarot will mentor graduate students on topics related to this award.<br/><br/>Quasicrystals are physical materials with highly ordered molecular structures, causing them to produce pure point diffraction patterns, but which also possess rotational symmetries that are forbidden by the classical Crystallographic Restriction Theorem. The discovery of these materials in the 1980's by Dan Shechtman revolutionized the world of crystallography and later earned Shechtman a Nobel prize. In the mathematical world the study, and even the existence, of quasicrystals is intimately related to the theory of aperiodic tilings of Euclidean space. Quasicrystals are often modeled by cut and project sets, which give an abundance of examples of such tilings and which, generically, are good examples of systems which possess `aperiodic order'. In the last decade there has been an explosion of insight linking problems in number theory with problems about cut and project sets. A number of unsolved problems in Diophantine approximation have been reformulated, and some have been solved, using ideas from the theory of mathematical quasicrystals. Major problems about sets with aperiodic order have also been solved by understanding the reverse connections. The research in this project is centered around well-known open problems such as the Littlewood Conjecture and the Pisot Conjecture, which are sitting on the border of these subjects. It aims to develop the theory around them in order to create progress in both the realms of pure and applied mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is often important but quite difficult to use such moment-to-moment rules to predict the state of the system in the relatively distant future.  Will a change in regulation lead to a speculative bubble?  Will present interventions suffice to stop an outbreak?  Will the solar system fly apart?  In a broad mathematical sense, all of these questions reduce to understanding whether some aspect of the dynamical system in question is 'stable' or 'unstable'.  That is, does it vary slowly and predictably as the system evolves, or is it prone to change rapidly and chaotically with a small variation in the system.  The research in this project aims at better understanding the mathematics of dynamical systems, and in particular at determining and describing those parts of a system which are most unstable.  Funding for this project will, among other things, support the principal investigator's graduate student as well as several undergraduates who are helping to run math circles for local K-12 students.  It's broader impact will be further felt through the principal investigator's involvement with the Riverbend Math Center, which is a local independent non-profit organization dedicated to promoting math education at all levels.<br/><br/>This project concerns problems in the intersection between analysis, complex algebraic geometry and dynamical systems. The problems stem from a very general program for constructing and analyzing measures of maximal entropy for rational self-maps of projective space. The work will prominently feature the particular case of rational maps preserving a meromorphic two form.  Specific issues to be investigated include `algebraic stability' for degree growth of maps, the manufacture and intersection of dynamically natural closed currents to produce invariant measures, and combinatorial `train track' models for the dynamics of real automorphism on rational surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These conferences have been held every three years starting in 2002. The five-day meeting will be structured in three parts: half-hour talks in the mornings by leading researchers in the field to describe recent important advances; mini-courses in the early afternoons to enable advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from related fields to learn some of the foundations of the area and discuss important open problems, and 20-minute talks in parallel sessions in the late afternoons to allow all attendees to present their research. A large number of early-career researchers, including members of underrepresented groups and undergraduate students, from both the Cornell SPUR and University of Connecticut REU programs, are expected to benefit from these courses. A number of applied mathematicians and theoretical physicists attend these conferences, so the conference will help foster the growing interactions between the mathematics and physics communities with interests in these areas.<br/><br/>There are many ways in which fractals appear in current mathematical research. The topics of this conference are those where the underlying space is fractal, and the subjects studied include the analogs of differential equations, random processes and models of physical interactions taking place on these fractal spaces.

Harmonic analysis involves breaking up a mathematical object such as a function into pieces that are easier to understand.  The beauty of this area is that the pieces are oftentimes simple, yet represent the whole with accuracy.  Number theory involves deceptively simple statements about the integers, easy to test, yet often difficult to prove.  Though seemingly disparate, analysis and number theory share many interactions. For instance, one can use intricate analysis of complex functions to answer fundamental questions about prime numbers.  This project explores a variety of problems at the interface of these two areas.  In particular, the PI will consider discrete variants of operators in analysis, which enjoy applications in fields such as medical imaging and cosmology.  To analyze these operators, continuous techniques often fail, and one has to develop number theoretic techniques adapted to the underlying geometry of the analytic problem. The PI seeks to provide new bounds, new techniques, sharper analysis and broader connections.  The PI also plans to bring Fourier analysis, a fundamental decomposition of the time-frequency domain, such as that used to understand waves, into the emerging field of arithmetic statistics.  Here she seeks to provide sharp counts of a wide variety of objects of arithmetic interest, such as elliptic curves used in cryptography.  As a broader impact, the PI will spark new mathematical conversations between analysts and number theorists and also improve the educational and scientific climate for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project addresses several fundamental questions at the interface of analysis and number theory.  Firstly, the PI pursues bounds for discrete variants of continuous operators in harmonic analysis that involve integration over a curved subvariety.  These bounds provide quantitative distributional facts about the underlying Diophantine equations that define these varieties, which makes them different from their continuous counterparts.  In particular, since continuous techniques usually do not carry over in this setting, the PI will develop refined number theoretic techniques to bound several operators, including multilinear spherical variants, variants defined over the primes, and higher codimensional analogues.  In particular, the higher codimensional study should open new avenues of problems as very little is known in this setting. Solving these problems has connections to discrete geometry, lattice point counts of surfaces, and Falconer's distance conjecture.  In another series of problems, the PI will pursue ""sparse bounds"" for both continuous and discrete operators.  Sparse bounds are a refinement of Lebesgue space bounds that allow one to deduce weighted estimates.  Finally, the PI plans to pursue a far reaching program in arithmetic statistics.  This is an area greatly developed on the algebraic side recently. The PI plans to inject Fourier analytic techniques to obtain precise lattice point counts that are adaptable to take advantage of the power of the algebraic techniques and push those bounds even further.  In particular, the PI hopes to obtain counts on certain objects such as elliptic curves, with an eye to not only developing techniques, but also fostering interactions between number theorists and analysts in new ways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the continuous case, this phenomena has been intensively studied for decades. If we average over objects in a discrete setting like the integers, or some other high dimensional lattice, the smoothing properties of the average have only recently started to be studied.  A natural object to study is the average over a discrete sphere in a five dimensional lattice. The proof that the average improves functions engages a range of deep aspects within number theory and analysis. However, resolving the natural limits for this question still seem difficult. In this project, these questions will be explored in a setting that involves both continuous and discrete phenomena.  These questions are also elementary to state, which makes them amenable for mentoring programs, from undergraduate through postdoctoral levels.  <br/><br/>An improving inequality in the continuous setting has been widely studied since the 1970's. However, the corresponding questions in the discrete setting have only just attracted attention. For instance, averages over the discrete sphere in the d-dimensional integers, with d at least 5, have a rich theory of improving inequalities, paralleling the much better known continuous case.  The proofs however involve complications arising from multi-frequency analysis, as well as fine estimates on Kloosterman sums. There is a richer theory, the outlines of which are appearing, giving a sharp range of inequalities for some arithmetic varieties.  This subject also allows for the proof of certain sparse bounds. The latter are scale-free versions of the improving inequalities. A sparse bound immediately implies other weighted and vector valued consequences.  The latter are new in this subject. These questions reveal new aspects of these averaging operators, and require new modes of investigation, deepening the connection between harmonic analysis and number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the quantity under study, these PDEs reveal the relation between the rates of change in different directions, and dictate the properties and evolution of the quantity. At the heart of the study of PDEs is a particular characteristic of solutions known as regularity. Theoretically, regularity is necessary to justify the models, and is the stepping stone for other properties of the solution (existence, uniqueness, and long term behavior). In practice, applications of the models involve numerical solutions of the PDEs and to obtain reasonable results requires stability of the solutions, which is often a consequence of regularity. Broadly speaking, objects that might seem rough often turn out to be regular if they satisfy an elliptic equation or constraint. The investigator will investigate three specific phenomena under this general philosophy: free interface problems, optimal transport maps, and free boundary problems. The results of this project will have numerous applications in other fields such as computer vision, data mining, machine learning, material sciences and biology.<br/><br/>The first project will investigate interfaces arising in the study of liquid drops exposed to electric fields. The goal is to show that these interfaces are smooth in low spatial dimensions. This is related to an important conjecture in the physics literature. The second project concerns the optimal transport map between convex domains in Euclidean spaces. The plan is to show that without any extra assumptions on the domains, these maps can be very regular ""up to the boundary"".

Later mathematicians considered several such functions that were put together in group of transformations and studied what are called group actions. The goal of the conference at Wesleyan is to bring together a variety of researchers and students whose work connects to the study of group actions in dynamics to discuss the latest research findings and to seek collaborations to attack open problems in this area. <br/><br/>Homogeneous dynamics has proven to be a powerful tool in the study of number theory and geometry. Although in many cases qualitative results already suffice for applications, there are situations in which it is essential to obtain effective, quantitative results in homogenous dynamics. It usually involves giving estimates on the rates or error terms which concern various aspects of group actions on spaces. The conference will discuss recent progress on effective equi-distribution and shrinking targets in homogeneous dynamics, and study how these results could help advance the understanding of problems in number theory. Another main topic of the conference is the behavior of dynamical systems modeling a ball bouncing around inside a polygon. This research subject has found exciting connections and applications to algebraic geometry, rigidity theory in geometry, Teichmuller theory, and other areas of mathematics. The conference will host talks on recent works in this direction and discuss their applications to the geometry of tiling, translation surfaces, interval exchange transformations, and related topics. The conference will also include research talks in probability theory and random walks on groups, geometry of nilpotent groups, marked length spectrum, and rigidity of surfaces. It will provide a great opportunity for graduate students to be exposed to different perspectives of the modern theory of dynamical systems and to communicate with conference participants.

Composite materials, for example, are manufactured by intermingling two or more constituent materials and often have very different physical properties (heat or electrical conduction, for example) from the individual components. Surprisingly, the properties of the composite material are typically not a simple average of those of its components--it matters greatly how the (microscopic) intermingling is arranged. We want to understand precisely how the large number of microscopic interactions give rise to the macroscopic behavior of such systems, to be able to predict the macroscopic properties of the system by carefully looking at the microscopic arrangement of a sample, and to know exactly how large such a sample must be before our predictions are accurate. We proceed by developing and analyzing idealized mathematical models that display the key features and complexity of real physical systems, but still simple enough that they can be studied mathematically. Very often, our models are partial differential equations with stochastic coefficients--that is, the underlying microscopic behavior of the system is assumed to be random--and the goal is to understand the statistics of the system. Our objective is to develop mathematical approaches that are (i) informed by the physics of the systems, (ii) robust--they can help us solve a variety of other, similar problems arising in, for example, statistical physics and probability theory, and (iii) quantitative--they lead to quantitative estimates of the uncertainty and insight into the development of numerical algorithms for simulation and prediction. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Obtaining an ""averaged"" partial differential equation that describes the large-scale behavior of an underlying highly heterogeneous equation with many degrees of freedom (for instance, one with random coefficients) is referred to as ""homogenization"" in the mathematical literature. The homogenized equation is typically much simpler than the ""true"" heterogeneous one, and hence easier to work with. It is therefore important to understand precisely how well the homogenized equation approximates the true equation, and this is the goal of homogenization theory. Mathematicians have recently developed a complete quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for elliptic equations, and this theory has already been shown to have some surprising and important applications to probability theory and statistical mechanics. The present project aims to continue in this direction, by applying and developing homogenization techniques for gradient lattice models and related models in statistical physics, to the study of hypoelliptic diffusions arising in kinetic theory (modeling gases and plasmas) and toward understanding the behavior of diffusions forced by random vector fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis is an extension of the Calculus that accommodates imaginary as well as real numbers, and several complex variables is the part of complex analysis that is applied to higher dimensional problems featuring imaginary numbers.  Despite the terminology 'imaginary' numbers have actually increased the applicability of Calculus and are ubiquitous in areas such as electrical engineering and signal processing.  Important recent work in several complex variables touches on geometry, differential equations, and dynamical systems among others.

While some of these connections are centuries old, there have been exciting developments in recent years. The award will allow a diverse group of mostly early-career mathematicians to interact with more established researchers. Bringing together this group will provide an excellent opportunity for interaction, shared insight, and further development. The organizers expect this to be a valuable educational opportunity as well as a research conference. Holding this conference at the SCGP will make it accessible and visible to the physics community, leading to interactions that might not occur as readily otherwise.<br/><br/>The workshop will bring together experts from interconnected fields. One example is the connection between Brownian motion, harmonic measure, analysis of singular integrals, and geometric properties of domains. This topic relates how a randomly-moving particle sees the boundary of the region in which it moves, the equilibrium charge distribution on the boundary of this region, and classical questions in analysis. Another example concerns function theory and dynamical systems: which geometric properties of functions are most important in studying the associated dynamical system formed by the iterates of the function, and on the other hand, what can the dynamical system tell us about the geometry of the initial function? The speakers include prominent researchers from a wide range of areas, including computer science, applied mathematics, dynamical systems, probability, analysis, and geometry. Many speakers have a history of making good use of such interchanges for groundbreaking work, some with important practical applications. Some specific examples are Ingrid Daubechies? work on wavelets and their numerous applications (for example, image compression), Peter Jones? work on diffusion geometry for data analysis, Svitlana Mayboroda?s work on localization of waves (used in LED light design), and Assaf Naor?s work on metric embeddings and algorithms, with applications in computer science.

It embodies many challenges and new, exciting mathematics. The conjecture was originally made around 2000, and a large body of literature has been accumulated on the subject while many unsolved problems remain. It has connections with and applications to many other parts of mathematics; for example, it is connected to index theory, which attracts the attention of many researchers from various fields.  Another connection is to the holomorphic extension problem in several complex variables, another important branch of mathematical analysis.   The extension problem itself goes back to the 1970s, and recent progress on the Arveson-Douglas Conjecture sheds new light on this old problem.

Hyperbolic dynamics is colloquially known as ?chaos theory? and studies chaotic (or ?unpredictability? properties) and long-term ``behavior on the average? of such dynamical systems.

Classically symmetries of a physical system are described by algebraic objects known as groups, which act on the observables of the system. In quantum systems, however, the observables are described by noncommutative operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras). In this setting a new kind of symmetry emerges. The algebraic objects that naturally arise are called tensor categories, and have proved to be very successful at describing symmetries of low dimensional quantum field theories, topological phases of matter, and quantum statistical mechanics. The goal of this project is to apply the theory of tensor categories to understand the relationship between noncommutative operator algebras, as well as exploring the role of tensor categories in low dimensional quantum systems.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three main problems. The first is to use tensor categories to classify and construct discrete inclusions of von Neumann algebras building on recent progress in this area, furthering the work of the PI with David Penneys and with Shamindra K. Ghosh. The second is the study of Alain Connes' chi invariant for finite von Neumann algebras from the point of view of braided tensor categories. We propose a generalization of this invariant using non-invertible bimodules, along with new methods of computation of this invariant that will allow us to distinguish previously indistinguishable classes of von Neumann algebras. Finally, we investigate the algebraic process of gauging braided tensor categories, which described the interaction between quantum and classical symmetry in topological phases of condensed matter systems. This is an important construction from the physical point of view, but mathematically difficult to understand. The primary problem for this project is to establish the  existence of gauged categories in physically relevant situations such as permutation symmetry, generalizing the results of the PI with Terry Gannon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, there are two physical experiments one can perform with a bounded, smooth planar lamina.  Firstly, one can hit a billiard ball and watch its trajectory over a long time as it bounces off the boundary of the lamina.  Secondly, one can resonate the lamina and observe the modes of vibration as the frequency increases.  One of the oldest works regarding the latter experiment includes Chladni's experiment in the 18th century. The PI and collaborators recently discovered that there is an unexpected connection between the types of trajectories one observes, and the geometry of patterns one obtains as a result of vibration. In modern language, this is a study of the relation between classical dynamics and corresponding quantum dynamics. The project aims to further explore this newly found connection in various setup to expand our knowledge about the impact of the presence of chaos in classical dynamics to the corresponding quantum dynamics.  This research involves training upper class undergraduate students and graduate students, and developing a topic course for them.<br/><br/>To be specific, the PI is interested in the impact of ergodicity of geodesic flow on the geometry of nodal sets of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The PI proposes to investigate the geometry of nodal sets in two contrasting cases: hyperbolic 3 manifolds with a cusp and circle bundles over closed surfaces endowed with a metric that is invariant under the circular action. The geodesic flow is always ergodic in the former examples, and never ergodic in the latter examples.  The complexity of the nodal set will be measured by the zeroth and the first Betti numbers. The PI also proposes to study the long-standing problem regarding the existence of embedded eigenvalues of Hodge Laplacian. This is the first step to be done in order to understand the interplay between ergodicity and eigenforms of Hodge Laplacian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a) one can try to  minimize the number of symbols used in encoding the information, or b) one can maintain ""certain structures"" (say by repeating some ""pattern"") in encoded messages in order to avoid loss of information, provided that a couple of errors can be made during its transmission.

What the relation is between the discrete and continuous ""worlds"", how one impacts the other, and what laws they obey are the fundamental questions that the PI intends to investigate. This project focuses on the Hamming cube, the simplest discrete object that consists of binary strings of given length and that can encode any complex information. As the complexity of the information increases, the lengths of the encoded strings increase exponentially. The goal of the project is to develop mathematics on the Hamming cube that would allow us to encode the structures of the continuous world into the discrete world, and vice versa. The new techniques developed could have surprising applications in complexity theory as well as classical and quantum algorithms. Many of these problems are accessible to students and this project aims to continue the PI's work with undergraduate and graduate students in this area.<br/> <br/>This project will consider a series of problems in the Gauss space and, most importantly, in its discrete counterpart, the Hamming cube. Unlike the classical case of the unit circle, many fundamental questions of Fourier analytic type are still open for the Hamming cube due to its unique discrete geometric structure. The first and main direction of the proposal is to resolve Weissler's conjecture, an old open problem in complex hypercontractivity theory on the Boolean cube that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness of the Hermite operator with complex time. Weissler's conjecture has important implications in several areas of mathematics including combinatorics, computer science, probability, isoperimetry, and approximation theory. The new techniques will be based on developing ""two-point"" inequalities. The second  direction of this research is to develop methods of harmonic analysis to find good estimates on the norms of various linear operators acting on a class of functions on the Hamming cube whose Fourier spectra belong to given prescribed sets. The basic examples include Bernstein-Markov type inequalities and their reverse forms for functions on the Hamming cube that live on the low and high frequencies respectively. The third direction is to understand the universality phenomena of the Gaussian measure. In particular, the goal is to investigate uniqueness of the functional Ehrhard inequality, which is the sharp analog of Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the Gaussian measure. The analysis will be based on Monge-Ampere type partial differential equations and semigroup methods. The fourth direction is to develop the duality between martingale inequalities related to sharp dyadic square function estimates and the problems of isoperimetric type; that is, gradient estimates for functions on the Hamming cube.

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. In this project, the PI will further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. This project also has a substantial educational component: The PI will develop a research experience in data science for first year undergraduate students at Louisiana State University (LSU). This program will prepare participants for a career in STEM, solidify their knowledge of basic mathematics, and give them an opportunity to learn about data science. <br/><br/>In the research part of this project, the PI will study bounded domains in complex Euclidean space and relate intrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the geometry of the Kaehler-Einstein metric) to extrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the CR-geometry of the boundary). Many classical results in the subject consider bounded domains in complex Euclidean space, assume that the boundary is smooth, and make assumptions about the CR-geometry of the boundary. For domains with non-smooth boundary, the PI will prove new variants of classical results by assuming geometric conditions on the Kaehler-Einstein metric instead of conditions on the boundary.  Using this approach, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory where metric space techniques applied to group theory not only lead to progress on old problems, but also many new and interesting examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the heart of general relativity lies Einstein's field equation which relates the curvature of spacetime to its energy/matter content. Solutions of this equation describe astrophysical phenomena such as black hole and gravitational waves. The primary goal of this project is a precise description of the dynamics of black holes which are out of equilibrium: as time evolves, they are expected to settle down to a stationary black hole under emission of gravitational waves. Attaining this goal requires the development of novel mathematical tools in microlocal analysis and spectral theory. In a nutshell, the main principle of microlocal analysis is to keep track simultaneously of the position and the momentum (or frequency) of a propagating wave. Spectral theory, in this context, is concerned with the characteristic frequencies and amplitudes of waves surrounding an almost stationary black hole. The problems under investigation are closely connected to recent advances in astrophysics. The gravitational waves emitted by a dynamical black hole were recently detected experimentally; their frequencies and amplitudes contain a large amount of information about the properties of the black hole, such as its mass and angular momentum. Directly motivated by the experimental detection of the merging of binary black holes, the investigator furthermore aims to initiate the mathematical study of the interaction of several black holes. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The nonlinear stability problem of the Kerr family of black hole spacetimes has been a driving force behind the development of the modern theory of wave equations on curved spacetimes. The investigator will study this problem for slowly rotating black holes by combining recent advances in spectral theory and dynamical systems with novel microlocal tools. This will in particular require a significant extension of the set of tools developed for the analysis of elliptic partial differential equations on compactified/singular spaces to the hyperbolic setting. Using similar techniques, the investigator will analyze the sharp asymptotic behavior of solutions of linear wave equations, including the Maxwell and Klein-Gordon equations, on black hole spacetimes. Moreover, the investigator will consider problems related to proving quasinormal mode expansions and ringdown for black holes settling down to their equilibrium state, motivated by recent experimental observations of gravitational waves. The investigator plans to relate the decay rate of spacetime metrics towards equilibrium in the exterior of black holes to their regularity near the inner black hole horizon in the context of Penrose?s Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture. The second part of this project concerns the construction of multi-black hole spacetimes. In particular, on cosmological spacetimes, the investigator proposes to construct vacuum spacetimes in which the black holes are eventually out of causal contact. The third part concerns inverse problems for passive and active measurements for nonlinear wave equations in settings in which the inverse problem for the corresponding linear equation has not been solved yet. The investigator plans to use the nonlinear interaction of waves deep inside of an object of interest in order to create artificial waves which carry information about the object back to its surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time into different frequency components, similarly to how a music chord can be expressed as the pitches of its constituent notes. Harmonic analysis studies how the time information and the frequency information interact with each other. A fundamental question (i.e. Fourier restriction problem) that has been studied for decades is how the geometry of the frequency support of the Fourier transform dictates the size of the original function in time. Various quantifications of such relations are referred to as Fourier restriction estimates and turn out to be extremely challenging to study. Even for the simplest geometric objects such as spheres and paraboloids, many questions are still wide open. Restriction estimates are interesting also due to their connection with many other problems, within or outside analysis. It is well known that restriction estimates can be applied to study the Kakeya conjecture (on the minimum area of a set containing a unit line segment in each direction), the existence and growth of solutions to Schrödinger and wave equations, and the number of solutions to Diophantine equations in number theory.<br/><br/>This project studies several problems related to Fourier restriction estimates. First, the principal investigator intends to further the investigation of the Fourier restriction conjecture for the paraboloid and the cone via the polynomial method. This method explores the algebraic structure of the time-frequency decomposition of the function, and has shown to be extremely powerful in obtaining many state-of-the-art results in the theory. Second, the principal investigator proposes to continue the study of weighted restriction estimates (i.e. when the Lebesgue measure is replaced with a fractal measure) and apply them to estimate divergence sets of the Schrödinger or wave equations and to distance set problems (on how the size of a set dictates the size of its distance set). The major difficulty in this direction is the lack of a crucial tool (orthogonality) caused by the presence of the fractal measure. Here an interesting approach will attack the distance set problems directly by studying the behavior of the fractal measure. Last, the principal investigator wants to explore the role in restriction theory of a recently developed tool called sparse domination. This method, arising from singular integral theory, is a way to reduce the study of the original continuous, spread out operator to that of a class of much simpler dyadic, positive, local operators. This method has shown to be extremely useful in singular integral theory and has become a modern view of point in describing operators. The principal investigator plans to further the study of sparse bounds of operators related to restriction estimates and with a Kakeya nature, such as the Bochner-Riesz multipliers, singular integrals along manifolds, directional maximal operators, and multi-parameter singular integral operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
