Techniques and results developed by                    Pearcy during the last 12 years involving the concept of dual                   algebra generated by one or several fixed bounded linear                        operators on Hilbert space will be used.                                             Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the               infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,               when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has                the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                   matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.

One key idea is to construct a measure on these                   paths so that one can talk about the ""volume"" of a set of paths                 and thus integrate over the loop space.

Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics."

The underlying motivation for the  studies lies in the expected significant applications to systems theory and  functional analysis. The research can be viewed from the point of view of  interpolation theory and meromorphic matrix functions, or as explicit work on the  correspondence between the Weil divisor approach and the factor of automorphy  approach to complex vector bundles over closed Riemann surfaces.  In the former  one wants to construct meromorphic matrix valued functions interpolating given  points on a closed Riemann surface.  In the latter, one takes local solutions to  form a holomorphic vector bundle and asks for conditions which guarantee that the  bundle be trivial. This is where Weil's work enters.    The work described in this project arises in systems analysis where one is  interested in selecting optimal functions from classes all of whose members  satisfy the same conditions.  The conditions may be given as prescribed pointwise  values of the functions.  It then becomes essential that one first solve the  interpolation problem to classify all such functions before establishing the  optimal ones."

It is possible to study the  groups through triples of complex numbers derived from the traces   of the generators.

Finally, students supported  by this award will consider how classical function theory  relations discovered by Hardy and Littlewood carry over to  bounded quasidisks.        Studies in geometric function theory focus on how domains  are mapped into one another by smooth functions on which  various distortion restrictions are placed.

The work  includes a search for geometric conditions an algebraic variety  must satisfy in order that the plurisubharmonic functions on the  variety satisfy estimates in the spirit of the classical  Phragmen-Lindelof Theorem.  The reason for this line of  investigation stems from the observation that many properties of  constant coefficient partial differential operators are  characterized by estimates for plurisubharmonic functions on a  variety.  A second line of study concerns ongoing work  combining complex analysis and multiserver queues.  The  connection derives from the fact that the Markov chains  underlying the queuing processes are given by homogeneous,  vector-valued random walks on the integer points in the positive  orthant.  The resulting functional equation has coefficients that  are matrix-valued analytic functions and the unknowns are  vector-valued analytic functions. Other work centers on the  embeddability for three-dimensional Cauchy-Riemann manifolds.   The goal here is to test whether all embeddable Cauchy-Riemann  structure on the 3-sphere must be the boundary for a strictly  pseudoconvex domain diffeomorphic to the complex 2-ball.  A final  topic concerns the classification of harmonic maps on the  2-shpere into the projectivized Hilbert space and the question of  whether they must factor through a finite-dimensional  sub-projective space.       Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the  century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one  complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory  differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was  far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more  affinity with partial differential operators of first order.  It  thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of   differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.  Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic  mathematical forms.  ***"

The                 first areas concerns computational algorithms for approximating                 the inverse of classical layer potentials on nonsmooth domains.                 One is interested in determining mathematically justified                       numerical schemes for approximating inverses of boundary integral               operators arising from layer potentials.  These potentials are                  associated with boundary value problems for second order                        partial differential equations and systems.  A second line of                   study concerns Fatou theory and potential theory for nonlinear                  elliptic equations and linear parabolic equations with                          nonsmooth coefficients.

It may turn out that the ideal                 is the entire space.  This type of deconvolution is only of                     interest when one can control the degree of the multipliers.

The second line of investigation               concerns integral geometry on the Heisenberg group.  If the                     integral of a function taken over translates of the same curve by               an underlying group always results in a constant value, can one                 make any assertion about the function?  In one complex dimension                the answer is taught in undergraduate classes.  In higher                       dimensions the problem of deciding which are the admissible                     curves remains to be determined.

For this a better understanding of random matrix               products, especially their large deviations, seems essential. The               study of random matrix products, in turn, leads to questions                    concerning random walks on nonabelian groups and the theory of                  Gibbs measures and thermodynamic formalism: in particular, a                    significant component of the research effort will be directed to                producing accurate approximations to the transition probabilities               of random walks on discrete groups and semigroups, and developing               a theory of Ruelle-like operators appropriate for this purpose.                      Investigations into the behavior of certain chaotic                        dynamical systems will be conducted, in particular, those in                    which the phase space is stretched at different rates in                        different directions.  Unusual geometric objects that arise in                  the ""phase spaces"" of these dynamical systems, called                           ""repellers,"" and their connections with the nature of the                       dynamics will be closely studied.  The theory of probability                    predominates in these investigations: questions involving the                   behavior of ""typical"" orbits are studied by choosing an initial                 state of the system ""at random."" This viewpoint leads to related                problems in probability theory proper, mostly concerned with                    certain features of random walks on state spaces with a highly                  noneuclidean geometry (""matrix groups"")."

The geometry and                   symmetry structure of a manifold determine a priori analytic                    inequalities for the natural operators that characterize analysis               on function spaces over the manifold.  These include the Fourier                transform, Green's functions and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.                 The work seeks to develop and understand analysis on Lie groups and             Riemannian manifolds through the study of differential operators,               singular integrals and variational problems intrinsic to the                    manifold. Principal directions are (1) the role of renormalization              arguments in controlling the behavior of oscillatory phenomena and              (2) geometric analysis of higher-order multilinear differential                 operators with tensor structure. Central to this research is the                interplay between geometric structure of manifolds and harmonic                 analysis of the operators using conformal invariance and geometric              symmetrization.  Sharp constants for variational problems provide               a rich source of geometric and probabilistic information.                            Insight into the mathematical framework is gained from exact               model calculations in conformal string theory and statistical                   mechanics using the conformal symmetry of critical phenomena.                   Computation analysis, especially computation and computer graphics,             is used to provide intuition and strategy for problems where the                geometric structure is too complex for elementary analysis."

For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                 being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics."

Related work on the                       representations of nilpotent Lie groups and harmonic analysis                   will also be carried out.  A differential operator is said to be                hypoelliptic if the smoothness of a solution of the corresponding               inhomogeneous equation is related to that of the inhomgeneous                   term (often referred to simply as the right-hand-side of the                    equation).  By analytic, one means that analytic solutions are                  guaranteed when the inhomogeneous term is analytic.  A few cases                where analytic hypoellipticity for elliptic operators occurs are                known and a few where it fails are also known.  The vast middle                 ground is untouched and represents the main theme of this                       research.  Additionally, in those cases where hypoellipticity                   fails, it remains to determine exactly what order of smoothness                 one can expect to possess and to relate it to underlying                        geometric invariants of the domain on which the operator is                     defined.  The work begins in three-dimensional Euclidean space,                 but has natural extensions to similar question on nilpotent                     groups like the Heisenberg group, as well as to compact manifolds               with boundary.                                                                       This research has many deep connections with the foundations               of partial differential equations.  On the surface it appears                   highly abstract and distant from the physical world.  In                        practice, the fundamental results derive from the study of                      specific examples which occur in various applications.  To give,                a priori, information about the solution of a complex partial                   differential equation can be of immense value to any user of                    mathematics."

The solution vectors provide examples of               one parameter groups of automorphisms of the full n-dimensional                 space.  When the vector field is complete, the automorphisms can                be continued indefinitely.  One goal of this project is                         to determine the extent to which every holomorphic vector field                 can be approximated by a complete one. A second line of                         investigation focuses on the image of two-dimensional space under               a holomorphic embedding.  More precisely, work will be done in                  determining the type of algebraic variety which can be omitted by               such an embedding.  It is known that one complex line may be                    omitted and three complex lines cannot.  Additional work will be                done in an effort to understand how the example of Duval allows                 for a Lagrangian disk to be embedded in two-dimensional space                   which is not polynomially convex.  Yet, in the appropriate sense,               allpolynomial hulls can always be explained in terms of                         holomorphic disks.  The difference must lie somewhere between the               idea of a holomorphic disk and the older idea of an H-infinity                  disk. Questions of this type have been studied for decades, so                  progress is expected to be slow.                                                     Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the                    century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one                   complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory                     differed widely from its predecessor.  The underlying geometry                  was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far                 more affinity with partial differential operators of first order.               It thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics                 of differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the               fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.                  Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic                  mathematical forms."

Circle packings have long been                an intriguing concept in mathematical research.  In 1985 William                Thurston proposed that circle packings - packings of plane                      domains by circles of various sizes - could lead to a completely                new point of view in conformal mapping.  This turned out to be                  the case and this project is one of several by-products of that                 now famous lecture.  The idea has grown and prospered.  Circle                  packings are exhibiting faithful discrete analogues to the                      classical results of geometric function theory such as the                      Schwarz-Pick lemma, Dirichlet problem, uniformization theorem,                  Brownian motion, etc.  The current project concentrates on the                  discrete version of the length-area method, a powerful, but                     unwieldy method exercised by a few experts and not easily                       understood by consumers of function theory.  The second part                    concerns infinite packings, possibly the most speculative part of               the project.  Most research to date considers only finite                       packings.  The final component of the research involves packings                using circle with overlap.  There are fundamental results which                 allow for overlap, but little work has been done on this                        generalization.  Past research led to the development of software               for manipulating, displaying and animating circle packings.  This               is both a research tool for performing experiments and a                        practical method for creating the pictures needed for                           presentation.  The software is freely available.                                     Complex function theory is the mathematical basis for                      computing with and visualizing the behavior of complex functions                of a complex variable.  The subject has an extensive history                    and is normally studied concurrently as analysis and geometry.                  This project adds a new dimension: computation.  Circle packing                 leads naturally to computer simulation.  This in turn has led to                new insights and proofs in the classical theory. To prove its                   worth, the new point of view will have to lead to new ,                         unexpected discoveries."

Self-similarity is a subject of intense                       interest today because of its relationship with fractal geometry                and wavelet analysis.  However, these relationships can be traced               to work in the early 30's by Wiener and Wintner on Fourier                      transforms of Cantor measures.  Work to be done includes the                    computation of dimensions of classes of self-similar measures.                  There are two directions in which the concept will be expanded.                 The first involves replacing strictly contractive transformations               in their definition and replacing this with average                             contractivity.  One can no longer guarantee compact support in                  this case.  The growth rate of such measures and the smoothness                 of their Fourier transform are subjects for investigation.  The                 second direction replaces the convex combinations with variable                 weights.  Here one is interested in existence and uniqueness of                 the measures as well as their Lp and pointwise dimensions.  Work                will also be done in analyzing the Radon transform of                           self-similar measures.  The two natural questions to be                         considered are whether or not the Radon transform is invertible                 and whether one can characterize the range of the transform.  The               transform is known to preserve the class of distributions if and                only if the transform of the measure is not slowly decreasing.                  For self-similar measures this is not the case, leaving open the                question of what the proper spaces ought to be.                                      Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics                   best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose               complex problems into fundamental components.  These                            components are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.                   Finally, the solution is reconstructed through a recombination of               the components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are                   examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the                      other representing a continuous decomposition. More recently                    the wavelet theory added new dimensions to some of the more                     classical approaches to harmonic analysis."

The theme is that of unique                           continuation of solutions and related issues.  By unique                        continuation one understands the problem of showing that there                  are no (non-zero) solutions vanishing in an open set.  A second                 question, whereby one asks whether a solution can vanish to                     infinite order at a point is called the strong continuation                     property.  Both are variations on the question of whether two                   solutions which agree on an open set (of infinite order at a                    point) must agree forever. A number of positive results are                     known, depending both on the smoothness of the equation and the                 underlying dimension.  Recent examples show that in the case of                 certain classical equations, Schrodinger with Kato class                        potentials, unique continuation fails.  One of the specific goals               of this project is to extend the basic tool underlying the best                 results, known as the Carleman inequalities. These inequalities                 only apply to constant-coefficient equations. Further analysis of               more general inequalities suggest that progress can be made in                  establishing good estimates which can be applied to general                     elliptic equations.  Related work will be carried out on the Bers               problem which asks whether solutions whose gradient vanish to a                 certain degree at the boundary must reduce to constants.                             Abstract as these problems appear in there generic form,                   they are easily seen to be important from the point of view of                  users of mathematics, especially in those cases where                           approximation of solutions can lead to spurious ones.  Knowledge                of uniqueness of continuation can provide a level of confidence                 that reasonable approximations lead to the correct answer."

The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,               and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences."

The problems are well-posed in the sense that the                data sets are not so burdensome as to rule out any solutions, but               sufficient for the reconstruction. The problem of determining a                 quantum mechanical potential from its scattering amplitude goes                 back to the beginning of quantum mechanics.  But little attention               is given to finding data sets for which the problem is                          well-posed in the sense that the mapping from the potential to                  the scattering data is continuously invertible.  One likely                     candidate for such a data set is backscattering data, the subject               of this research.  Much successful work has been accomplished on                the question in three dimensions, though mainly confined to small               potentials.  The present work seeks to remove this assumption and               look for more general results, possibly giving up some degree                   of well-posedness.  Work will continue on                                       two-dimensional backscattering as well, where a type of                         singularity in a parameter makes backscattering a much more                     untractable problem, even assuming compact support of the                       potential.Inverse problems in the context of this project are                   formulated in terms of classical equations, such as the                         Schrodinger equation. These equations may represent wave                        phenomena involving magnetic and electric potentials, acoustics                 and other type of waves in the presence of obstacles.  Although                 much of the research focuses on the mathematical analysis of the                inverse mapping, its connections with the physical world are                    easily traced."

Several application areas such as fluid mechanics (a modified Burgers equation), reaction-diffusion systems, the Murray-Oster mechanochemical theory of pattern bifurcation and competing population models. Much work has been done on wave solutions of most of these equations. This project is concerned with the stability of such wave solutions, a topic which has received very little attention. The project gives a very important framework of stability analysis for travelling waves by using topological invariants. It is a conceptually new idea; very robust to perturbations because of its topological character. The basic idea of 'stability index' has been developed recently. It shows great potential as a new tool which can be used to explore many examples of wave phenomena occurring in both theoretical mathematics and the physical world. The travelling wave is the most basic object used to understand dynamic pattern formation such as shock waves, crystal growth, and flame propagation, since the phase change occurs only through the motion of interfacial boundaries and such a motion takes the form of travelling waves. The important issue is knowing whether such waves are observable or not, which is the same thing as asking whether they are stable. It is, in general, quite difficult to determine their stability properties, since travelling waves are large amplitude solutions connecting two different stable states and usually contain sharp transition layers. The new topological machinery used in this project to detect stability is not a perturbative one, and hence has the potential for broad applicability."

A very broad class of equations referred to as fully nonlinear will be under consideration. Also included will be the associated evolution equation one can form from a time-dependent differential equation. The thrust of the work carries forward investigations into a class of solutions developed during the past decade known as viscosity solutions. To be precise, a viscosity solution is a class of functions within which one expects to find a solution to the equation. The methods are closely related to that of continuous game theory in that from many possible solutions one wants to show that a best can be determined. There has been considerable success in obtaining existence results for viscosity solutions in which the basic operators involved are bounded. The present work seeks to expand the possibilities for extending to unbounded versions and infinite dimensional generalizations. A second line of investigation will be carried out in an effort to obtain numerical approximations of fully nonlinear equations. The work proceeds in several directions. One must determine what an effective type mesh would be and in terms of this give error estimates. This will first be done without regard to boundary conditions, but with the understanding that such cases must be taken into account at a later date. A modest beginning will be made on uniformly elliptic equations. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for numerical approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations. ***"
