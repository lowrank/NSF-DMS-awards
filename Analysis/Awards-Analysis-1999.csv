Feldman<br/><br/>Abstract: Feldman will conduct research in operator theory and its interplay with complex analysis. Primary emphasis will be placed on studying special classes of linear operators that are close to normal operators, such as subnormal, hyponormal, and essentially subnormal operators. Questions regarding various forms of cyclicity for cosubnormal and cohyponormal operators will be investigated, as will the relationship between cyclicity and the existence of intertwining maps. Other topics to be explored include: the existence of hyperinvariant subspaces for subnormal operators; ""generalized eigenvectors"" for adjoints of subnormal operators; the principal function for a subnormal operator, and its relations with such classes of operators as Toeplitz operators, Hankel operators, and self-commutators.<br/><br/>Operator theory is a natural extension of the ideas of matrices and linear algebra to infinite dimensions. In simple terms, an operator is just an infinite array or matrix of numbers and is used in linear problems involving infinitely many unknown variables. Although many intractable real world problems are not linear, one can frequently ""linearize"" a given problem to produce a new problem that is both linear and solvable and that has a solution which closely approximates -- hence provides valuable information about -- the solution of the original physical problem. Perhaps the simplest example of this is the idea of the derivative from calculus, which is used to approximate a curve by a straight line (something that is linear). In a multivariable setting, the precise analogue of the derivative is a linear operator. Recognizing how useful and powerful a tool the derivative of even a single variable function has become in all areas of science, one can readily appreciate how important it is to understand fully the structure of linear operators. While some operators can be rather ""pathological"" in character, the subnormal operators that are the objects of study in this project have a great deal of structure: they are very natural themselves, and they arise in natural ways. Operator theory and linear algebra have had a profound impact on all branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering. It is hoped that Feldman's research will likewise exert an influence not only on pure mathematics but on the applied sciences as well.<br/>"

Peller<br/><br/>Abstract: V.V. Peller is going to continue to work on Hankel and Toeplitz operators and  their applications in different fields of mathematics: control theory, prediction theory, approximation theory. It has become clear that it is especially important in applications to study Hankel and Toeplitz operators with matrix-valued symbols. The development of the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators with matrix-valued symbols depends on further development of noncommutative function theory (the theory of matrix-valued or operator-valued functions). On the other hand, many problems arising in noncommutative function theory can be solved with the help of Hankel and Toeplitz operators having matrix-valued symbols. In particular, V.V. Peller is going to study the following topics: spectral characterizations of completely regular vectorial stationary processes; characterization of unitary-valued functions of vanishing mean oscillation (and other classes) in terms of Wiener-Hopf factorizations;  unitary interpolants of continuous matrix functions as well as of matrix functions in other function classes; the relationship between Wiener-Hopf factorizations and thematic factorizations; similarity to a unitary operator; estimates of resolvents; and the existence of nontrivial invariant subspaces for Toeplitz operators with matrix-valued symbols.<br/><br/>Hankel and Toeplitz operators are certain special classes of operators which have proved to be very helpful in many fields of mathematics and for applications in control theory and electrical engineering. V.V. Peller is going to continue his research on applications of these interesting operators to the theory of functions whose values are matrices rather than real or complex numbers. The theory of such functions is considerably more delicate than classical function theory because the values of such functions do not have to commute; i.e., the order of the factors in a product cannot be changed without risk of changing the value of the product. On the other hand, such matrix-valued functions are extremely important in applications. For example, they appear in a natural way in systems theory when one must deal with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. V.V. Peller is going to study several important problems that involve matrix-valued functions (with technical names such as factorization problems, approximation problems, interpolation problems, etc.). The solution of these problems would lead in turn to new results on Hankel and Toeplitz operators as well as to numerous new concrete applications.<br/>"

Poltoratski<br/><br/>Abstract: Poltoratski's research will focus on a variety of questions related to the boundary behavior of Cauchy-Stieltjes integrals. The project consists of three parts. The first part concentrates on problems in complex function theory. Specifically, the PI plans to study the interaction between singular and nonsingular components of Cauchy integrals. The second part of the project is devoted to applications in quantum dynamics and  Anderson localization, some of the most interesting areas involving mathematical models of modern solid state physics. The objective of the third part of the project is to complement the well-developed theory of contractive operators in Hilbert spaces with a deeper understanding of the structure of so-called almost unitary operators.<br/><br/>Complex function theory is one of the most classical parts of modern mathematics, yet at the same time is one of its most rapidly expanding and developing fields. The present stage of its development features many promising new applications to various areas of mathematics and physics. Among the cornerstones of complex function theory is the integral formula named after the famous French mathematician Augustin Cauchy. The importance of this formula lies in the fact that most analytic functions of one complex variable can be defined as or represented by Cauchy integrals. Poltoratski plans to study various properties of functions defined via Cauchy integrals near the boundaries of their domains, where the precise behavior of such functions is subtle and difficult to comprehend. The results will then be applied to several other central topics in mathematics, as well as to quantum dynamics. The application to quantum dynamics will deal with mathematical models of wave propagation. A conjecture made by the Nobel laureate P. Anderson about the behavior of waves in disordered media has made this an area of intensive research activity in recent years. Despite this flurry of activity, wave propagation in disordered media is not completely understood, especially in spacial dimensions greater than one. New information about this phenomenon could be highly relevant to a host of problems in physics and engineering.<br/>"

The primary motivations for and applications of the first part stem from the theory of stationary random processes; namely, from the study of multivariate processes, which dates back to work of Kolmogoroff and Wiener. The theory of matrix weights has many connections with both finite dimensional geometry and noncommutative harmonic analysis. The second part of the project is closely related to problems of geometric measure theory, analytic capacity, partial differential equations, and image processing. The PIs have managed to free the theory of Calderon-Zygmund operators of an unnecessary homogeneity assumption, historically one of the cornerstones of that theory. So far their research has led to many new results in the theory of regularity of multivariate random processes. It has had an impact on geometric measure theory as well. For example, their methods yield an alternative (and rather more streamlined) approach to Guy David's solution of the famous Vitushkin's conjecture that unrectifiable one-dimesional sets have zero analytic capacity.<br/><br/>A central part of modern harmonic analysis deals with ""singular operators"" of one type or another. Such operators are pervasive in the scientific landscape: they turn up in mathematical physics, probability, engineering, image processing, etc. The expression ""singular operator"" can take many different meanings, but whatever its precise meaning within a given context, the term almost always reflects the fact that only subtle tools can be applied to the investigation of such operators. They are resistant to probing by ""brute force"" methods. In particular, one needs to employ techniques that are sensitive to certain intrinsic cancellations in order to gain control over the singular behavior. So-called Calderon-Zygmund theory appeared in the early 1950s as a first means of coping with singular operators of the type under scrutiny in this project. The PIs broaden this theory in two directions. First, they allow the number of degrees of freedom enjoyed by the operators to increase, thus exposing a whole new kind of cancellation. Second, they make a rather bold move by disgarding one of the basic and, it was earlier thought, indispensible assumptions of the theory. In light of discoveries by the PIs, this assumption (known technically as the homogeneity of the underlying space) seems now to be completely superflous. The PIs' approach has already had several significant consequences: solutions to several long-standing problems, streamlined proofs for other important but difficult results, and the general feature of making complicated arguments much shorter and more lucid.<br/><br/>"

Clark, Rongwei Yang<br/><br/>Abstract: This project aims to develop a concrete setting in which the transition from single operator theory to a multivariable theory becomes very natural. In single operator theory, the vector valued Hardy space is used to provide canonical models for contractions. Without loss of generality, we can identify the vector space with another copy of the Hardy space over the unit disk, and the vector valued Hardy space then becomes the Hardy space over the bidisk. By stating and reproving some of the classical results in model theory in this new context, we can identify some operator theoretically  important things in the Hardy space over the bidisk and develop some general techniques for further research. The research focuses on the compressions of two shift operators, namely multiplications by the two coordinate functions, to quotient Hardy modules.<br/><br/>Single operator theory, which originated in the study of systems of linear equations, has a wide range of applications, from image processing, to robotic design, to financial market predictions. ""Operator pairs"" provide a model for studying interactions between different systems. Two simple examples are interactions between different electric networks and the effects of one financial market on others. This project aims to develop a concrete setting for the study of operator pairs. There are two main advantages to this setting. First, it furnishes many computable examples which make the study easier to apply. Second, it incorporates single operator theory in a very natural way. This feature, in terms of a practical example, means that it will allow one to monitor single markets and multi-market systems in a unified way.<br/>"

We are developing elements in equivariant K-theory based on ideas from geometric quantization for semi-simple Lie groups. These constructions unify and extend previous constructions developed by Fox, Haskel, Julg, and Kasparov.  We are using non-commutative geometry to develop models of neural networks, which we hope will have several advantages over the classical models. The models should provide for greater computational efficiency and the framework should allow for the computation of invariants of the large-scale structure of the model.<br/><br/>A. Connes and G. Kasparov have developed new areas of mathematics that provide tools for studying systems that are inherently complex. There have been a number of spectacular successes of these ideas when applied to mathematical problems in geometry and topology. The techniques are starting to be used on problems that were originally considered outside the scope of the theory and there is promise that these new tools will prove useful in a huge range of applications. This project consists of two programs using non-commutative geometry. The first program is studying ways that symmetry can incorporated into this new geometry. We have new techniques that we believe are natural and will shed light on the structure of geometric objects. The second program involves the use of non-commutative geometry to develop models of the brain and brain functions, commonly known as neural networks. The inherently complex structure of the brain has been a major stumbling block for mathematical modeling and one of our goals is to apply some of the techniques of non-commutative geometry to obtain new models of neural functioning.  An unexpected, but delightful, development has been serious communication between the mathematics department and the neuroscience community on our campus. A true collaboration at the undergraduate, graduate and research level is developing and promises to enrich both mathematics and biology. Mathematical neuroscience has a huge potential for applications (as already demonstrated by the applications of classical neural networks) which will increase as computational power increases and our understanding neural computation expands.<br/>"

The reasons why these polynomials are so effective come from the associated differential equations, the recurrence relations, and the weight functions. The goal of this project is to construct and study similarly useful families of orthogonal polynomials of several variables. A very fruitful approach to this aim is the study of systems which have finite symmetry groups. The main types considered in this proposal are the symmetry groups of the simplex, the hypercube and the icosahedron. The first two comprise infinite families, labeled by dimension, and are associated with systems allowing arbitrary permutations of the coordinates, or sign-changes as well. The icosahedron is a three-dimensional regular solid with a truly ancient historical record, which is the subject of current research in quasi-crystals. These are paradoxical structures; ordinary crystals like salt have a shape which allows the rigid fitting together of an unlimited number of molecules, and even though the icosahedron does not allow such patterns (called regular tessellations) there exist physical substances with icosahedral structures (for example, pentagonal symmetry appears under electron microscope observations).<br/><br/>This project is concerned with finding orthogonal bases of  polynomials; these bases have a special significance because they can be used directly in the analysis of functions; the origin of the phrase ``harmonic analysis'' is the technique of decomposing a musical note into fundamentals and overtones. This technique has developed into such applications as decompositions of quantum-mechanical systems into different energy levels, or the approximations of functions by easily computable polynomials. Besides the icosahedral group, the proposal deals with the analog of spherical harmonic polynomials for the hyperoctahedral group, which allows both permutations as well as sign-changes of the co-ordinates. One of the aims is to investigate the application of orthogonal polynomials to quantum systems with three-body interactions as well as the spin Calogero models (identical particles in a one-dimensional space, each with a spin of +/- 1). It is a goal to find formulas specific enough to allow asymptotic calculations: qualitative descriptions of the long-term behavior of the systems. Finally, it is planned to investigate exceptional differential equations, in the sense that some underlying parameters take on specific isolated values leading to unusual phenomena; on the one hand there are the bi-spectral equations in the Korteweg-deVries scheme, and on the other hand there are ``super-integrable'' quantum-mechanical systems. The technical foundation of this proposal is the differential-difference operator associated with reflection groups which was constructed by the proposer and has been used in many research articles in physics and mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>"

By using the representation theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras and ideas from algebraic quantum field theory, a class of subfactors known as Jones-Wassermann subfactors can be constructed. These subfactors have close relations to two-dimensional conformal field theories that have attracted great attention. The aim of this project is to study Jones-Wassermann subfactors related to coset theories, which conjecturally exhaust a large class of conformal field theories. Solutions to the problems proposed for investigation, though focused on subfactors, are expected to lead to answers to open questions arising in conjunction with both the representation theory of infinite dimensional algebras and low-dimensional topology. <br/><br/>Quantum mechanics, which revolutionized our understanding of the physical world  when it arrived on the scene early in this century, raised a number of significant mathematical (not to mention philosophical) questions. The theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann in order to provide a proper mathematical framework in which to deal with such questions. Subfactor theory is a branch of the subject of operator algebras that studies the ""positions"" a smaller algebra might occupy within a larger one. It turns out that, because of the intricate nature of the algebras in question, the possible positions are under rather rigid control, allowable configurations often reflecting symmetries of the quantum mechanical systems to which the algebras correspond. Symmetries, especially the hidden symmetries that subfactor theory helps to uncover, play a fundamental role in science, for they usually provide the key to reducing the complexity of the questions under study by bringing the number of free parameters that must be accounted for into a mathematically mangeable range. The search for hidden symmetries has thus become a focal point for the activities of many physical scientists. Subfactor theory provides researchers with a precise tool for understanding symmetries in a host of mathematical and physical settings. The aim of this project is to shed new light on some of the important mathematical issues that surface in this context.<br/>"

Rohde<br/><br/>Abstract: Rohde will investigate distortion properties of conformal and quasiconformal mappings, using methods from geometric function theory as well as from dynamical systems. Quasiconformal mappings are weakly differentiable homeomorphisms that are ""almost conformal,"" in the sense that they distort angles by at most a bounded factor. These maps generalize conformal mappings and arise naturally in geometry, geometric function theory, complex dynamics, and PDE. Two specific problems Rohde will investigate are to estimate the derivative of a conformal map of a disk that admits a  quasiconformal extension to the complex plane and to find bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of quasiconformal images of circles (so-called quasicircles). Both questions are closely related to Brennan's conjecture concerning the degree of integrability of the derivative of a conformal mapping of the unit disk. Rohde will also study geometric properties such as porosity or wiggliness of sets in euclidean space, together with estimates for their Hausdorff dimension. Such sets appear naturally both in complex dynamics and in geometric function theory.<br/><br/>Conformal mappings have applications in many areas, both within mathematics and outside it. These include control theory, heat conduction, fluid dynamics, and complex  dynamics, to name just a few. One standard use of coformal mapping is to change coordinates from one region to a simpler region, say to a disk, where a problem can be viewed from a new perspective, hopefully one in which the solution to the original problem becomes more readily apparent. A famous instance were this approach paid huge dividends occurred in aerodynamics, where conformal mappings were instrumental in coming up with the original design profiles for airfoils. From the standpoint of conformal mapping, regions with smooth boundaries have been well understood for some time. However, the appearance of fractals in many branches of science led to the natural problem of investigating the conformal mapping properties of regions bounded by highly nonsmooth, fractal-type curves. The core objectives of Rohde's research are, on the one hand, to obtain a deeper understanding of fractal curves by means of conformal mappings, and conversely, to study some problems about conformal mappings by analyzing  the geometry of regions with fractal boundaries<br/>"

In particular, points that approximately are zeros of the polynomials are close to exact zeros.  The same set of polynomials can become ""unstable"" when applied to matrices (and even more so when applied to operator algebra variables).  That is, there can be contractive matrices that, when substituted into the polynomials give results near zero, and yet there is no actual matrix-root close to the approximate solution.  We call such approximate solutions phantom solutions.  These phantom approximate solutions can be misleading in the context of computer models.  There is a notion of stability for a relation that does not require the relation to be polynomial.  Much of this project will study relations that remain stable when applied to operator algebra variables.  These are rare, but tend to be related to interesting invariants of operator algebras.  Stability results limited to the realm of matrices will also be explored, with the hope of finding some applications to numerical analysis.<br/><br/>Polynomial relations have stability properties that we rely on every day.  Take the example of a laser cutting some flat material, where the cut-points are determined as the zero-set of a set of equations.  If the x and y coordinates of the laser come close to satisfying these equations, we go ahead and fire the laser, for we are sure that close to this approximate solution there is an exact solution, and thus we are cutting close to where we should.  In computer modeling, one's model is often based on more that just numerical variables.  In particular, much of numerical analysis involves matrix-valued computations.  It turns out that equations that are stable for ordinary values become unstable for matrix values.  That is, there can be approximate solutions to equations that are not close to any true solutions.  We call such things phantom approximate solutions.  This project will study these phantom approximate solutions and ways to detect and avoid them.<br/>"

In different terminology, Heinonen proposes to<br/>characterize locally Euclidean metric gauge by using the theory of<br/>quasiregular maps. This is a joint project with Dennis Sullivan. In Part<br/>III, Heinonen discusses the problem of the branch set of a quasiregular<br/>map. Analytic conditions are searched that would imply a given<br/>quasiregular map is a local homeomorphism. This problem is relevant to<br/>Part II, and to problems in nonlinear elasticity where deformation of<br/>bodies are investigated.  Part III is a joint project with Tero<br/>Kilpel""ainen. <br/><br/>The proposal continues the PI's earlier investigations, where discrete<br/>methods in analysis and geometry are being searched that would serve in<br/>spaces that are not smooth in the classical sense.  Here the word<br/>``analysis'' means the branch of mathematics that developed out of the<br/>Calculus; it is the study of continuous changes in infinitesimal data,<br/>from which one wants to predict global conclusions.  ``Geometry'' is the<br/>study of space, its many forms and varieties, in many possible dimensions.<br/>Discrete methods mean the opposite to continuous, or calculus methods, and<br/>involve more finite, ``counting'' ideas, such as those done by a computer,<br/>albeit in this work still of analytic and geometric flavor. The concept of<br/>quasiconformality enters the discussion in the most subtle way:  it allows<br/>the space and its formation to be singular (for instance, with kinks or roughness) at times and in places, but not everywhere and not all the time. There is a certain control in the distortion, which perhaps looked artificial to the mathematicians 40 years ago when the first research in the field was conducted. Now quasiconformality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mathematics.  From the work of Dennis Sullivan in the late seventies we know that every space<br/>that locally looks like a flat space of Euclid has a quasiconformal<br/>structure albeit not a smooth structure in general; and this is true in<br/>every dimension but four. Nevertheless, also in dimension four, there are<br/>conjecturally an infinity of spaces where one cannot do ordinary, smooth<br/>analysis, or calculus, but where one can do quasiconformal, nonsmooth<br/>analysis. The proposal addresses both the need to have a better<br/>understanding of this new calculus in nonsmooth spaces and methods how to<br/>recognize spaces that are quasiconformally Euclidean. Although the main<br/>questions in the proposal are motivated by a basic quest for understanding<br/>the structure of space, the consequent study of singularities in<br/>transformations has had applications to material sciences, where one wants<br/>to know when a deformed body collapses onto itself under a strain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Its principal goal is the investigation of the dynamical and geometric structures of ""higher rank"" systems.  Such systems naturally appear both in dynamical systems and geometry.  In particular, the investigator will study rigidity properties of hyperbolic actions of higher rank abelian and semisimple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal of classifying such systems.  The investigator also plans to investigate Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones) and their geodesic flows.  Geometric, dynamical and group theoretic tools will be used in this research.<br/><br/><br/>Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields that investigate the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in a fluid flow).  New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos, fractals) have changed our perception of the world fundamentally.  Dynamics and ergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and analysis for these investigations. Dynamical systems have had a major impact on the sciences and engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science.  Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology.  Geometry is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.  Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now studied for aesthetic reasons and its close ties with physics and other sciences and applied areas (computer vision e.g.).  Geometry and dynamics are closely related as some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and geometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems.  The main goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Important examples of such systems arise from geometry. <br/>"

These algebras will then be studied with the indicated homological tools, and the results will be interpreted as providing information on the specific situations that are studied.

These problems are interesting and important not just from the point of view of complex analysis, but also from the perspective of differential geometry, nonlinear analysis and PDEs, classical dynamics, and mechanics. More specifically, Huang wishes to further the present understanding of various rigidity phenomena in several complex variables. This includes the classification of holomorphic mappings between balls in different complex spaces. He would like to understand the local holomorphic invariants of a certain class of real submanifolds of complex spaces, the so-called the Bishop manifolds. He intends to continue his previous work on the regularity of CR mappings between real analytic   hypersurfaces and his investigation of invariant metrics, including their applications to the study of dynamical properties of holomorphic mappings.<br/><br/>Complex numbers and functions of complex variables have become, since the 19th century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and in its application to other areas of science and engineering. Indeed, the solutions of many problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on an improvement in these complex analytic tools and a better understanding of their basic properties. For instance, engineers working in planar aerodynamics must contend with the interplay between vertical and horizontal speeds. It is now well understood that if one takes the simple step of combining these two speeds into a vector and then representing that vector as a complex number, many aspects of the aerodynamic flow become much easier to visualize, with the result that many problems become easier to solve. Similarly, in materials science the standard method for treating multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out, for instance, that the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is mysteriously related to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project could lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these very equations, which would then translate to a deeper understanding of the related mechanical properties of materials.<br/>"

We impose additional requirements on the membranes<br/>constructed, that is they also have the additional property that the first <br/>eigenvalue be lowest possible. This is the requirement that the membrane <br/>have the lowest tone. Natural questions that now arise are (1) Does such an<br/>optimal configuration exist?(2) Is the junction region between the<br/>membranes, the so-called free boundary smooth? If not smooth what<br/>is the nature of the singularities, i.e. what is the Hausdorff dimension<br/>of the singular set. (3) If there is symmetry in the problem does it reflect<br/>and impose conditions that the materials have to be so glued as to respect <br/>this symmetry. This problem is also amenable to numerical simulation<br/>which we have also carried out, and in part the numerics have provided us <br/>with insight into what sort of rigorous theorems can be proved.<br/><br/>     The project really stems from questions proposed to the PI by<br/>M. Imai and I. Ohnishi of the Institute of Electro-Communications<br/>in Tokyo and K. Kurata of the Tokyo Metropolitan University. The<br/>object is to design composites of materials with two different densities<br/>such that the resulting composite has the lowest tone. For example one way <br/>to naively view this problem is to patch together two materials in<br/>such a way that the resulting composite membrane vibrates in the<br/>slowest possible way out of all possible configurations that<br/>can be formed by gluing together the two given materials. The first<br/>question is (1) Is there always an optimal configuration possible?<br/>(2) Is the interface between the two materials making up the<br/>membrane smooth or necessarily are there sharp spikes? (3) If<br/>there is some additional symmetry in the shape of the membrane<br/>does it force that the materials be glued together in a way<br/>such that this symmetry is to be respected? These are basic<br/>Engineering questions that arise in many situations where say vibrations<br/>are to be kept to a minimum. Computer studies help, but what nails<br/>down with certainty, the description of the optimal configuration,<br/>are rigorous theorems about the arrangement of the materials. This is<br/>one of many problems in our project which can be summarized by saying<br/>that it is the determination of optimal shapes in the design<br/>of composite membranes so as to minimize vibrations and if possible<br/>determine a explicit recipe(algorithm) that will tell us how<br/>to achieve this optimal configuration.<br/>"

Jones, Ronald R. Coifman<br/><br/>Abstract: Professors Coifman and Jones will continue their work on the analysis and geometry of sets in Euclidean space. The research is centered on methods to classify sets or functions and to provide efficient descriptions of these objects. On the level of sets, this involves descriptions of, for example, the Julia set associated with a rational mapping or the limit set of a Kleinian group in terms of its Hausdorff dimension or related geometric concepts. Another example relates to potential theoretic aspects of sets, including algorithms that allow for fast computations. For functions, the relevant objective is to find short descriptions with prescribed error. A common aspect of the analysis of both sets and functions is the search for methods of reducing dimensionality (with prescribed error) so as to bring the problem into a regime where more classical methods apply.<br/><br/>The problems on which Jones and Coifman intend to work are those that now confront mathematicians who are forced to deal with massive quantities of data. While the modern computer has been very useful in treating many computational problems, severe limitations occur when the amount of data becomes too large.  Instead of treating the full set of data, one therefore seeks to reduce significantly the amount of information being handled, at the same time ensuring that only small errors occur in the process. After such a reduction has been made, more classical methods can then be used to analyse the reduced data. Harmonic analysis is a field that has been developed over the past century to accomplish precisely this kind of reduction, albeit for problems in the realm of pure mathematics. The projected research centers on exploiting these older methods and developing new ones in order to acquire efficient tools for treating a wide array of concrete data sets. One example of how useful this technique might be in a practical, everyday situation arises in the telephone industry, where it would be highly desirable to send only a small percentage of the sounds produced by one person, yet still have the message understood by the person listening at the other end of the line. The development of an effective method for compressing data in this instance would allow a large increase in the number of calls that could be sent on a single telephone line. <br/>"

Recent results by the PI and co-worker Keyfitz indicate that<br/>for a large class of two-dimensional problems, including standard equations of<br/>compressible flow, an analysis of their self-similar solutions leads to many<br/>results that are shared by the entire class of problems. They include an existence and uniqueness theorem that holds in the region where the flow is supersonic, and a description of possible singularities that may arise at the boundary where the flow changes from supersonic to subsonic. To complete the analysis, a theory of free-boundary problems for the positions of transonic shocks is needed. Preliminary results in this vein are encouraging, and the PI, plans to continue research in this direction. Tools of study include analysis of free-boundary problems for which a degenerate elliptic equation of novel type has to be solved, and asymptotic analysis of singularities. When completed, the results of this project will contribute to solving open problems in the field of multi-dimensional wave interactions and shock reflection problems, which include an existence theorem for oblique shock reflection by a ramp, bifurcation criteria for two-dimensional elementary waves, and the correct function space for a general existence theory that will capture possible singularities in the solution. In ONE-DIMENSIONAL conservation laws several novel phenomena, recently discovered by the PI, call for further exploration and understanding. They include nonexistence of classical weak self-similar Riemann solutions and the presence of bounded amplitude, high frequency, oscillatory solutions replacing the classical ones. Using compensated compactness methods these solutions were shown to satisfy the system of conservation laws in a measure-valued sense. Understanding what causes nonexistence, and what is the physical meaning of the oscillations, is one of the goals of  this research project.<br/><br/>Conservation laws are mathematical equations that describe processes central to<br/>technology, such as high-speed flows, supersonic jets, as well as flows through<br/>porous media which arise in environmental engineering and reservoir simulation.<br/>Understanding the structure of solutions of conservation laws is crucial for a<br/>successful simulation of these phenomena. The main difficulty lies in the fact<br/>that solutions to conservation laws admit ``shock waves'', which correspond to<br/>the sudden, abrupt changes in the flow properties. Shock waves influence the<br/>stability of high-speed flows, and are crucial in the simulation of oil recovery. In addition, based on the recent PI's findings, multi-dimensional conservation laws admit ``singularities'' in the solutions that have not yet been theoretically understood and which are difficult to resolve numerically. Their presence influences the outcome of the simulations. This project proposes an original approach towards understanding these singularities. Even more generally, in this project the PI proposes an organized approach towards the development of a general theory that would describe the structure of solutions of multi-dimensional conservation laws such as the equations that describe high-speed flows. Because the methods used to study one-dimensional conservation laws cannot be generalized to more than one space dimension, this research area is wide open. However, since almost all processes in technology are multi-dimensional, the development of such a theory is an imperative. In addition to the research aspects of this proposal, aspects of the work involving nonlinear conservation laws have been used successfully by the investigator in graduate student education, and continuation of this effort in similar directions is proposed.<br/><br/><br/>"

T.-R. McLaughlin<br/><br/>Abstract: The proposed research concerns applications of Riemann-Hilbert problems and new techniques developed for their asymptotic analysis to classical problems in (1) random matrix theory, (2) approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials, and (3) integrable systems. In random matrix theory, McLaughlin proposes to study eigenvalue statistics in situations when the limiting density of states exhibits ""atypical"" behavior in order to illustrate explicitly nonuniversal behavior in local statistics of random matrices. He further proposes to study coupled families of random matrices, which appear in the study of the planar appoximation to quantum field theory as well as in graph coloring problems that arise in statistical mechanics. Other directions include new asymptotic problems pertaining to the bulk scaling limit. In approximation theory, McLaughlin proposes to continue work on support properties of equilibrium measures, to gain further understanding of the relationship between the external field V and the support of the associated equilibrium measure. In addition, an investigation of pointwise convergence of polynomials orthogonal with respect to Freud weights is proposed. The proposed research is to study the generalization of Gibbs's phenomenon to Freud weights and to obtain a rate of convergence of approximation by such polynomials. In integrable systems, McLaughlin proposes (with A. Kuijlaars) to combine knowledge from approximation theory and singular limits of integrable systems, to investigate the onset of infinite genus oscillations in the small dispersion limit of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Another project (with S. Kamvissis and P. Miller) looks at a special class of initial data for the semi-classical limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation.<br/><br/>Random matrix theory has recently been the meeting ground for many areas of mathematics and physics. One reason for the subject's importance is the famous claim of Eugene Wigner who, in the 1950s, proposed that ""neutron resonance levels"" could be modeled by the ""eigenvalues of a random matrix."" Neutron resonance levels are special numerical values for the velocities of neutrons: when physicists fired neutrons at a large quantity of atoms with heavy nuclei, they observed that the neutrons were ""trapped"" by the bulk of atoms only for these special velocities. Wigner's conjecture asserts: the statistical distribution of the distance between these resonance levels is a universal quantity, just as the speed of light in a vacuum is, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, a universal constant. Over the years, Wigner's conjecture became a fundamental issue in mathematics as well as physics: Can this universal behavior be modeled by thinking of the resonance levels as ""typical"" eigenvalues of matrices chosen at random by some simple mathematical rules? For a large class of random matrix models, McLaughlin and his collaborators discovered a mathematically precise description of the statistics of eigenvalues of random matrices, thus providing a proof of Wigner's conjecture. A part of McLaughlin's current research is devoted to a deeper understanding of this fundamental universal behavior. In other directions, McLaughlin is working to develop further the techniques mentioned above, because of their application to many different areas of mathematical analysis and physics.

Kennedy<br/><br/>Abstract: This research will focus on how periodic structures arise in problems such as crystallization and sphere packing. One approach to understanding how the lattice structure of crystals comes about is to assume that the quantum mechanics produces an effective classical interaction between molecules. Then one studies the classical problem of how to arrange the molecules to minimize this classical energy. Even this classical problem is quite hard, containing the sphere packing problem as a special case. This research will use ideas from statistical mechanics for frustrated systems to prove the optimal configuration for some of these classical problems. A new, simpler proof of the sphere packing problem in three dimensions may be possible by these methods. The role of quantum mechanics in crystal formation has been investigated in the Falicov-Kimball model. Another goal of this research is to understand when this model has a periodic ground state and when it does not. The Falicov-Kimball model is defined on a lattice, but in nature crystals form in space which has no a priori lattice structure. A continuum Falicov-Kimball type model will be investigated. In this model the ions may occupy any site in space rather than just the sites in some lattice, and then the electrons hop between the ions. The goal of introducing and studying this model is to have a quantum  mechanical model that (hopefully) exhibits periodic ground states. <br/><br/><br/>This research will focus on how periodic structures like crystals arise. One of the most famous of these problems is the sphere packing problem. Given a large number of spheres of the same size, what is the best way to arrange them so that they occupy the smallest volume. For example, is the way one finds cannonballs stacked at a Civil War battlefield optimal in this regard? Although this problem is hundreds of years old and quite simple to state, it was only solved in the past year. The classical crystal problem is similar. One is given a bunch of atoms and a force law between them. The problem is to find the arrangement which minimizes the total energy of the atoms. The sphere packing problem has important applications to coding theory, and the crystal problem is at the heart of understanding how the crystalline structures that one observes in nature arise. These problems may also be thought of as optimization problems in a large number of variables. This research will develop techniques for establishing the solutions of such optimization problems. The problems are all difficult because they are frustrated -- the best arrangment for a small number of atoms or spheres is not the same as their best arrangment when they are part of a larger group. Techniques developed in statistical mechanics to study such frustrated systems will be adapted to these problems. Surprisingly, it appears that in all these problems the best arrangement is a relatively simple periodic one, even though one allows all possible arrangements, however complicated.

The proposal describes a possible<br/>approach to the problem of finding such an embedding when the<br/>associated CR structure is minimally smooth.  The third problem<br/>is concerned with finding sufficient conditions for either<br/>compactness or hypoellipticity of the complex Neumann problem in<br/>the case when the boundary of the domain is of infinite type.<br/><br/>It is well-known fact that not all results in mathematics can be<br/>immediately applied to so-called real world problems. Sometimes<br/>the proof of an important statement depends on abstract methods<br/>which cannot be easily applied in more concrete situations which<br/>call for an explicit construction. For the first problem, the<br/>proposer is examining a well-known theorem in algebra which uses<br/>abstract methods to explain why certain polynomials are always<br/>nonnegative. In order for this theorem to be used in the real<br/>world, it would be very important to find a constructive proof of<br/>this theorem.  The second part of the proposal has to do with a<br/>problem in geometry in which a a surface in effect is not smooth<br/>and has sharp corners or twists built into it.  Such problems are<br/>also important for applications because in problems having to do<br/>with the shapes of objects, it is rarely the case that the<br/>objects are completely smooth.  Although the problem that is<br/>studied is somewhat theoretical, it often happens that techniques<br/>developed in one problem can often be used in related areas as<br/>well.<br/>"

This research investigates how<br/>certain functions vary as parameters (internal, or external) are<br/>allowed to change a little; and also how understanding ""little"" or<br/>even infinitesimal variations helps in understanding large<br/>variations. Two specifics of this project are worth mentioning.

One line of work deals with separable extension properties. Here the most intriguing problem is whether K (the space of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space) is complemented in every separable operator space containing it (this is a ""non-commutative"" version of a classical result of Sobczyk).  A related issue is giving a complete description of separable locally reflexive operator spaces which are completely complemented in every separable locally reflexive operator superspace (an operator space counterpart of Zippin's characterization of the space of convergent sequences). Another direction of research is the study of maximal operator spaces (quotients of duals of commutative C*-algebras). The PI plans to determine the cardinality of the set of n-dimensional subspaces of maximal spaces, as well as the structure of n-dimensional subspaces of the dual of a 2n-dimensional commutative C*-algebra (in the spirit of Kashin's work). Possible applications of the proposed research include better understanding of the structure of function spaces, of the space of operators on a Hilbert space, and Banach space geometry in general (extensions of local reflexivity).<br/><br/>One of the key mathematical tools of quantum mechanics is replacing scalars (numbers) by operators on a Hilbert space (they can be thought of as infinite matrices). Further exploration in this direction led to the development of the theory of C*-algebras, and, later, to the introduction of the notion of operator space (also called ""non-commutative"" or ""quantized Banach space"").  One can view an operator space as a Banach space with additional structure, induced by its embedding into the C*-algebra B(H) of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H. The investigation of operator spaces  has advanced very rapidly over the last ten years, combining ideas and techniques from Banach space theory and the theory of C*-algebras. It has already produced answers to some long-standing problems of Operator Theory. The proposed research deals with two themes: the existence of non-commutative analogs of classical Banach space results; and the use of Banach space methods in the operator space case. If successful, this research will advance our understanding of connections between Banach and operator spaces, and potentially, enhance our knowledge of physical phenomena.<br/><br/>"

Hadwin<br/><br/>Abstract: This project includes the study of a generalized notion of composition operators based on unital endomorphisms of unital algebras of operators having a cyclic separating vector. This general notion unifies the analytic and measure-theoretic approaches, and it leads naturally to the study of a large collection of interesting new classes of operators. The project also includes attacks on Kadison's similarity problem from several different angles: one from a purely algebraic approach based on Pisier's new ''factorization'' results; another using invariant operator ranges involving a situation where the definition of the homomorphism is fixed but where the C*-algebras vary; and a third in terms of the hyperreflexivity problem for von Neumann algebras. Another part of this project includes a study of invariant subspaces. Here existence results will be based on new ideas of Haagerup, and stability results will extend previous joint work with John B. Conway. The project also includes a study of certain reduced free products of matrix algebras generating type III factors. Finally, the project includes further work on reflexivity and hyperreflexivity and approximate operator theory.<br/><br/>The theory of operators on Hilbert space is a part of mathematics that generalizes to infinite dimensions the basic ideas of matrix theory and elementary linear algebra. The growth of this subject was stimulated by and has applications to the study of integral and differential equations, quantum mechanics, and control theory. More recently, operator theory has interacted directly with many other important areas of both pure and applied mathematics. The general goal of operator theory is to understand the structure of various classes of operators and collections of operators. The proposer plans to study this structure theory from various points of view. Since operators are infinite objects, in some sense it is impossible to understand completely what they are. It is therefore natural to study ""approximations"" of operators, just as we approximate numbers in terms of finitely many decimal places. Unlike the situation with numbers, where there is only one notion of ""distance,"" there are many different notions of ""closeness"" for operators. The principal<br/>investigator plans to continue his extensive work on various approximation schemes, including certain distance formulas and a recent concept, free entropy, which is a type of approximation based on finite matrices. Another natural way to study operators is by breaking them into component parts and studying each of the parts separately. In finite dimensions this amounts to considering various decompositions of matrices, most notably the century-old Jordan canonical form. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to show that infinite-dimensional operators can always be broken into appropriate smaller parts. Indeed, this is the famous ""invariant subspace problem,"" one of the most intriguing unsolved problems in all of mathematics. The proposer has new ideas for attacking this problem as well as the related problem of determining, given that an operator can be decomposed into smaller pieces, the extent to which every nearby operator is similarly decomposable.<br/>"

An invariant for such von Neumann algebras,  which will be investigated in this project, comes from the  analysis of the  structure of convex sets, consisting of noncommutative moments associated with these von Neumann algebras.  This approach is related to Voiculescu's free entropy, where the (renormalized) asymptotic measure of such sets plays an essential role.<br/><br/> The operator algebras  studied in this project are  related to the  atom model introduced by Wigner.

Particularly intense development<br/>for the last several years has been in the field of averaging<br/>operators and Fourier integral operators associated to singular<br/>canonical relations. Andrew Comech obtained several general results in<br/>this field; in particular, the classification of singular canonical<br/>relations and regularity properties of the associated Fourier integral<br/>operators in the Sobolev spaces.  The approach was based on<br/>incorporating certain curvature assumptions into the modern tools of<br/>Harmonic Analysis.  Among the applications of these results are the<br/>regularity properties of the Radon Transform of Melrose-Taylor and<br/>smoothness of restrictions of solutions to hyperbolic equations.  In<br/>both cases Andrew's methods lead to the optimal conclusions.  The<br/>future research is aimed at the properties of solutions to non-linear<br/>hyperbolic equations, such as long-time behavior and soliton<br/>asymptotics of solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic equations.  Questions<br/>from the very foundations of Harmonic Analysis, which are related to<br/>the proposed research, include the regularity properties of the<br/>averages taken over lower-dimensional varieties (most importantly,<br/>averaging operators over curves).  <br/><br/>Andrew Comech is going to continue his research on the wedge of the<br/>two fundamental mathematical fields: Harmonic Analysis and the Theory<br/>of Hyperbolic Equations.  The research grows far into the modern<br/>development of the mathematics, being intimately related to nonlinear <br/>differential equations, attractors, and solitons.  On the other hand, <br/>the research has its roots deep in the natural sciences and technology. <br/>Particular interests of Andrew Comech are related to the properties of <br/>nonlinear wave equations of relativistic Quantum Physics, which are <br/>now widely investigated both in Physics and in Mathematics.  Not less <br/>interesting are the opportunities open due to applications to Tomography, <br/>as well as aspects of numerical computations involving Fourier Analysis.  <br/>These are active and promising areas of today's scientific research.  <br/>"

Specifically, in his study of dynamics of semi-dispersing billiards on Riemannian manifolds, the proposer plan to address the following questions: Is it possible to give any estimate for the topological entropy of the first return map of a non-degenerate semi-dispersing billiard with a ``finite horizon''? What can be said about the topological entropy of the billiards on manifolds without the non-positive curvature restriction? Most fundamental is the question about existence of universal unfolding space for arbitrary non-degenerate semi-dispersing billiards on non-positively curved manifolds of dimension greater than three, that the proposer plans to attack using the machinery he (jointly with D.Burago and B.Kleiner) has developed recently. Continuing his (joint with A.Katok) study of cohomological rigidity of Anosov actions of higher-rank Abelian groups, the proposer will attempt to establish cohomological rigidity of standard Anosov actions different from Weyl chamber flow; to obtain infinitesimal tensor rigidity of lattice actions on Furstenberg boundaries and differentiable rigidity of the projective actions of cocompact lattices. Central for proposer's program of studying the geometry of noncommutative operator spaces is certain generalization of Hilbert transformation and upper triangular projection at the same time, a spectral projection associated with a strongly continuous representation of a compact Abelian group on an arbitrary (UMD)-space. <br/><br/>The prevalent theme and tool in the proposal is the theory of dynamical systems. The theory in general investigates the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time. Theory of dynamical systems is intertwined closely with most of the major areas of mathematics and it often takes its basic examples from and applies its results to such different fields as physics, engineering, biology or sociology. Theory of billiard systems, for instance, lies at the interface of geometry on one hand and dynamics and theoretical mechanics on the other. Classical thermodynamics is essentially nothing else but mechanics of huge billiard systems. This is why a number of problems of the theory were first posed by physicists in their attempt to ""justify"" thermodynamics. Such justifications still is just a dream; but the proposer believes that his research brings us a little closer to its realization. One of these problems that has been open for almost half of the century (about existence of an estimate on the number of collisions between molecule of a gas) recently was solved with help of geometry of somewhat pathological spaces. Discovery of such an unexpected connection opened up several opportunities in the area that the proposer would like to pursue as outlined above.<br/>"

Classical and modern techniques of complex analysis will be applied to inductive limits of disk algebras generated by Blaschke products and inner functions, a special case of which is the algebra of generalized analytic functions, i.e., of functions on a compact abelian group with ordered dual that are analytic in a particular sense. Relationships between inductive limit algebras generated by one inner function and complex dynamical systems will be investigated. It appears that the ideas involved have great potential for further developments in the analysis on compact groups with ordered duals and for a host of topics: Wiener-Hopf operators, invariant subspaces of some function spaces, dynamical systems, commutative Banach algebra theory, analytic function theory, corona type problems, Bourgain algebras and Hankel type operators, stability under small perturbations.<br/><br/>This international cooperative research project is jointly funded by NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences and Division of International Programs. Its objectives will be achieved through direct cooperative research between Thomas Tonev of the University of Montana in the U.S. and Dr. Suren Grigoryan of Kazan State University in Tatarstan, Russia. Work on the project will serve to internationalize an ongoing domestic research effort in the area of abstract harmonic analysis by linking it with a similar project and other related research activities in Russia. The research will draw on the intellectual resources of both sides, and the direct contacts will allow the project to proceed at an optimal rate. It is the theory of dynamical systems, through its connections to abstract harmonic analysis, that lies at the root of the proposed research. This area, which is developing very rapidly at present, has important applications to many physical problems. It is well-known, for instance, that most processes in the physical world have an almost-periodic rather than strictly periodic behavior. One of the triumphs in the theory of dynamical systems has been the creation of mathematical tools for studying almost-periodic phenomena. This explains the great interest in almost-periodic functions and their close relatives, generalized analytic functions, which are among the principal objects of investigation in this cooperative endeavor. A successful completion of this project would lead to new discoveries of at first primarily mathematical interest but with great future potential for application.<br/>"

The theory facilitates probing deeply into the mathematical foundations upon which these physical systems are based, thereby increasing our scientific understanding of the various systems.

One involves the development<br/>of microlocal methods in spectral and scattering theory.

One type of<br/>problem in this area is the fine behavior of convergence of generalized<br/>eigenfunction expansions for the Laplace operator on a broad class of<br/>complete Riemannian manifolds.  Both in this study and other studies<br/>in spectral theory, such as spectral theory for quantum Hamiltonians <br/>for gauge fields, there arise problems in the Fourier analysis of<br/>Fourier integral distributions associated with transversally intersecting<br/>Lagrangians.  The project will also treat some inverse scattering<br/>problems, in which microlocal techniques for eigenfunction expansions<br/>appear as useful tools to filter out that part of the data whose<br/>measurement leads to ill posedness.  The other general area involves the <br/>study of PDE in various nonsmooth settings.  Some of the work here has <br/>been stimulated by work on equations of fluid motion in nonsmooth <br/>domains.

In one-dimensional dynamics, Blokh and Misiurewicz introduced the notion of super-persistent recurrence. The lack of such recurrence at a point is a mild expanding property. This behavior implies recent results by Blokh and Misiurewicz according to which wild attractors with negative Schwarzian derivatives are super-persistently recurrent and limit sets of critical points in a dense family of smooth interval maps are minimal. Blokh intends to use this device to study further properties of attractors and stability for smooth interval maps. He also hopes to extend the rotation theory to graph maps and then study forcing among periodic orbit portraits.<br/><br/>Many processes in biology, the physical sciences, and economics can be modeled by dynamical systems. Studying these models allows one to draw valid conclusions about the processes themselves and their long-term behavior. This project is aimed at studying a variety of such dynamical systems. Blokh intends to verify that either the behavior of the system is on average chaotic (but almost the same for the majority of initial conditions) or it coincides with the behavior of systems starting at a special finite set of so-called critical initial conditions. Also, a system is said to behave periodically if the same conditions recur with the same frequency all the time (e.g., the motion of the planets about the sun). Periodic dynamics are easier to study than more general motions, which is why it is important to understand periodic systems as fully as possible before probing the mysteries of more complicated systems. Blokh wishes to characterize all periodic behaviors of dynamical systems using only finitely many parameters. The results obtained will help to describe the possible outcomes for a variety of processes and to explain the prevalence of certain types of processes in both theoretical settings and the natural world.<br/>"

Professor Quinto will develop a boundary detection method for SONAR in shallow water and geophysical examination of structures near the surface.

Despite the simple definition, they contain all sofic subshifts and are much more intricate.  The PI proposes their comprehensive study based on an original approach rooted in the Wedderburn-Artin theory of algebras.  In particular, the goal is to explain topological structure of cocyclic subshifts via a Morse decomposition and their probabilistic behavior via the ergodic theory of the maximal measure.  The functional analysis of thermodynamical formalism will be deployed to compute the entropy and the occurrence probabilities of specific words.  The PI also plans to explore the impact of cocyclic subshifts on coding theory, probabilistic automata, theory of formal languages, finite dimensional algebras, and the general theory of dynamical systems.  The last connection, perhaps less obvious, is the main motivation of this project.  Topological methods of the Conley index may be applied to real-life dynamical systems (differential equations) to perceive them as generators of certain cocyclic subshifts --- which can be used then to detect orbits of the orginal system.  One application is rigorous verification of chaotic behavior, and the PI intends to write computer programs for chaos detection based on the theory.<br/><br/>From a more general perspective, this project explores new ideas in symbolic dynamics, a branch of mathematics that deals with infinite sequences of zeroes and ones and is largely motivated by problems of telecommunication, where routinely data is encoded by such sequences and the volume is large enough to justify the idealization to infinite sequences.  One mainly studies the sets of all possible sequences --- termed subshifts --- that can be generated (or recognized) by a particular type of device.  To give a classical example, sofic subshifts are recognized by automata capable of assuming only finitely many states, which are widely implemented in digital electronics (e.g. modems, hard drive controllers, etc).  Cocyclic subshifts, in turn, require more sophisticated automata that are abstractly specified by two (or more) square matrices A_0 and A_1.  An infinite binary sequence belongs to the subshift if, after putting the matrices in the place of symbols, we get a matrix product that never equals zero.  (For instance, 0110101...is rejected if for some initial segment, say 0110, we have A_0A_1A_1A_0=0; otherwise, it is accepted.)  This scheme can be satisfactorily implemented on a computer; however, it cannot compete with the existing technology without thorough theoretical research of the kind proposed by the PI.  Finally, the relevance of cocyclic subshifts transcends the narrow context chosen here to explain the PI's ideas:  cocyclic subshifts embody a fundamental aspect of (random) matrix products which are ubiquitous in mathematics, science, and engineering.  For instance, detection of chaos in dynamics (e.g. population dynamics in biology and medicine) is one area in which the methods developed by the PI can be implemented.<br/> <br/><br/>"

The first is to develop a more general and flexible form of the Ahlfors theory of covering surfaces, one that applies to variable domains. This will be done with particular emphasis on applications to complex dynamics and shared-value problems. The idea of the Ahlfors theory is to find a modified form of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for a map which is not a proper covering map onto its image, using the length of the relative boundary. Unfortunately, the conclusions of this theory as presently formulated are only valid for fixed base domains. Hinkkanen plans to consider domains that are variable in a suitable sense, incorporating assumptions that arise from specific applications. The project's second objective deals with solutions to the Painleve differential equations. The aim is to create new methods to establish, in a proper setting, the single-valuedness of such solutions and to investigate their growth.<br/><br/>Complex analysis, which is the general area of mathematics related to this proposal, provides technical and conceptual foundations for several fields of applications of mathematics, including many in physics and engineering. Specific examples include electrical engineering, and the two-dimensional study of the motion of fluids and gases (to which many three-dimensional problems reduce, due to symmetries). Complex dynamics contains, as a very special case, the study of the dynamical behavior modeled by quadratic polynomials, which both directly and via approximation surface as  fundamental building blocks in the investigation of numerous dynamical systems in physics, biology, and economics. The specific work involved in this project is expected to explain how the possible ways of arranging the geometric shapes of regions can have a significant impact on the behavior of certain complex dynamical systems. In addition, this research addresses global existence and growth properties of solutions to a well-known class of differential equations, the Painleve equations, which have applications in a wide number of areas, differential geometry and mathematical physics prominent among them. Particularly notable among such connections is the recent discovery of the usefulness of Painleve equations in string theory, a branch of physics that seeks to explain the structure of space and matter at a more fundamental level than present-day quantum physics.<br/>"

The data from a scattering experiment are mathematically<br/>represented by the scattering matrices, or S-matrices. The central issue<br/>in many-body scattering is understanding the structure of these operators.<br/>A new method is now available for the analysis; it adopts techniques used<br/>for the study of hyperbolic equations. This project will employ these<br/>microlocal techniques to analyze the wave front relation of the free-cluster<br/>to free-cluster scattering matrix in many-body scattering, involving<br/>arbitrarily many particles, when the subsystems have no bound states.<br/>This S-matrix represents scattering data when both the incoming and the<br/>outgoing particles are asymptotically free, i.e. they are not bound together.<br/>Its wave front relation describes the singularities of the outgoing data<br/>in terms of those of the incoming ones. More precisely, the main goal of the<br/>present project is to prove that if the subsystems of a many-body system<br/>have no bound states, e.g. if all potentials are non-negative, then the wave<br/>front relation of the free-cluster to free-cluster S-matrix is given by<br/>the broken geodesic flow to distance pi on the sphere. The absence of bound<br/>states simplifies the phase space structure of the problem and hence<br/>provides an ideal first step towards the understanding of the S-matrices<br/>in general. In addition, in this situation the problem is geometrically<br/>analogous to the wave equation in domains with corners. Thus, the completion<br/>of the project will demonstrate that scattering is in many respects a<br/>hyperbolic problem, similar to the wave equation. The next step will be<br/>to analyze what happens if there are bound states in some subsystems;<br/>in this case one has to combine the behavior of bound states with the<br/>classical dynamics to understand the propagation of singularities.<br/><br/>Indeed, many people are familiar with the following two descriptions of<br/>the propagation of light. First, in geometric optics, light propagates<br/>in straight lines, reflecting from surfaces according to Snell's law.<br/>That is, the angles of incidence and of reflection are the same, as if<br/>light consisted of little billiard balls. Second, light can be described by<br/>the wave equation, its propagation thus being similar to that of water<br/>waves. There are many ways in this particular example in which the first<br/>picture gives a rough description of the second, but the following<br/>connection has particularly wide-ranging generalizations: singularities of<br/>the amplitude of the wave (`sharp signals' or `jumps in signals') propagate<br/>along light rays. The purpose of the current proposal is to investigate the<br/>analogous relationship between classical and quantum mechanical particles,<br/>that is, to analyze in what ways does the motion of classical particles,<br/>considered as little billiard balls colliding with each other, describe<br/>the motion of quantum mechanical particles. In more concrete terms, how well<br/>does the motion of four billiard balls describe how four electrons collide<br/>with each other? Since it is easier to analyze the corresponding properties<br/>of classical systems than those of quantum ones, just as it is easier to<br/>describe light moving in straight lines than to solve the wave equation,<br/>the answer to this question significantly improves our understanding of<br/>quantum mechanics.<br/>"

The objective of the first part is to study the ground state properties of large atoms in a strong nonhomogeneous magnetic field. On physical grounds it is expected that the magnetic version of the classical Thomas-Fermi theory correctly describes the atom as the nuclear charge tends to infinity. The following specific problems need to be solved to prove this rigorously: (1) finding the proper Lieb-Thirring type inequality for magnetic fields; (2) describing the zero energy eigenstates of the three dimensional Dirac operator; (3) proving a semiclassical asymptotics result on the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the Pauli operator by constructing appropriate magnetic coherent states. The second part of the project aims at finding kinetic scaling limits of the long time Schrodinger evolution. Random impurities, phonons and electron-electron interactions modify the free evolution of an electron cloud via collisions. The goal is to characterize the large scale effects of these collision mechanisms by proving that the Schrodinger evolution converges to a macroscopic transport evolution described by the Boltzmann equation. The collision kernel needs to be determined separately in each case: it is linear in case of impurity and phonon effects, and it is nonlinear for many-body interactions.<br/><br/>First principles of physics (e.g., the famous Pauli or Schrodinger equations) tell us exactly what mathematical equation governs the behavior of any quantum system. Due to the size and complexity of the real systems, these equations are usually far too complicated to solve with even the most advanced of present-day computers. Approximate problems and models need to be set up and studied that retain the relevant features of the true problem but are simple enough to be computationally feasible. Physics and engineering generally use such simpler models (e.g., the Thomas-Fermi theory in atomic physics or the Boltzmann equation in electron transport theory). Besides the computational and numerical aspects of such models, it is equally important to investigate the extent to which these simplified models are consistent with the real ones; i.e., to determine the regimes of physical parameters in which it is justified to use them. Rigorous mathematical study not only gives a solid theoretical justification of the often ad hoc simplifying procedures, but very often helps to find the correct model as well. This is precisely the objective of the present proposal in the case of two important physical problems: (1) behavior of atoms in strong magnetic fields; (2) electron transport in an impure medium. Both problems have direct applications in semiconductor design. In addition, the first problem is of interest from an astrophysical perspective, for strong magnetic fields occur naturally on the surfaces of neutron stars and are responsible for such unusual physical phenomena as highly nonspherical atoms.

The operator space theory is  a natural quantization of Banach space theory.  The major difference between operator spaces and Banach spaces is that one considers  operator matrix norms and  completely bounded maps in the  category of operator spaces. In 1987, the PI succeeded in formulating an axiomatization of operator spaces by matrix norms.  Since then, a lot of progress has been made in this area.  In this proposal, the PI plans to continue his research in this direction and proposes  the following research topics:<br/>(1)  investigate the  local structure of the operator preduals of von Neumann algebras and the operator duals of $C^*$-algebras; (2) investigate the local structure on $C^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras; (3) investigate the geometric structure of matrix unit balls of operator spaces;<br/>(4)  investigate the application to locally compact quantum groups.<br/><br/><br/>The most profound distinction between classical and quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's principle that one must represent the basic variables of physics by operators rather than functions. The work of  J. von Neumann emphasized that it is important to pursue the ""quantized"" forms of mathematics.  Collaborating with F.J. Murray, von Neumann  succeeded in quantizing integration theory during the 1940's.  Since then, mathematicians have tried to quantize many other areas of mathematics such as topology, differential geometry, analysis and probability theory.  The theory of operator spaces is a natural quantization of functional analysis, or more precisely, a natural quantization of Banach space theory.  This is a recently developed promising research area in modern analysis.  The PI and his colleagues have established the foundation of this area.  They have also discovered some  far-reaching applications of operator space theory to related areas in mathematics such as operator algebras, non-commutative harmonic analysis, Kac algebras  and locally compact quantum groups.  The PI plans to continue his research in this direction and plans to explore a much broarder range of applications.<br/><br/>"

Michell's problem and its many variants and extensions have attracted a lot of attention in the last few years among engineers as well as mathematicians. In the coplanar case, Michell formally proved that, in the optimal layout, bars are arranged along the lines of principal strains of a displacement that arises as a Lagrange multiplier. These lines form an orthogonal system of coordinates in the plane. Any optimal design satisfying these conditions is called a Michell truss. Gangbo plans to study geometrical and topological properties of supports of optimal stresses. Techniques for studying this problem are similar to those that apply to the Monge-Kantorovich problem. Gangbo also plans to make use of the Monge-Kantorovich theory, which has recently been recognized as a powerful tool for constructively studying the semigeostrophic shallow water problem, which is a three-dimensional free boundary problem. <br/><br/>The Michell truss problem was originally motivated by the desire to engineer a structure built of beams capable of supporting a specified array of forces, and to do this with maximum economy by using the least quantity of a given elastic material. Of course, while trying to be as efficient as possible, one must still produce a design that ensures a safe structure. Gangbo's interest is to determine good models for the design of such least-volume frames. The determination of the endpoints of the bars of the frame is the most difficult part of this problem. The second part of the proposal consists in studying shallow-water flow, meaning flow in which the vertical length scale is small in comparison to the horizontal length scale (e.g., the flow of ocean currents). If one collects data at a given time, one hopes to predict how that data will evolve over time. For instance, if one measures the pressure of the water today, one would like to forecast its pressure tomorrow. In the geostrophic model, pressure is an important quantity to know. For instance, one can infer the speed of the water from its pressure. Gangbo will use the so-called Monge-Kantorovich theory, which has recently surfaced as a powerful tool in various fields of mathematics.  <br/><br/>"

D'Angelo<br/><br/>Abstract: D'Angelo's project will continue his investigation of a complex variables version of Hilbert's seventeenth problem (due to Catlin and D'Angelo) and give applications of it to complex geometry, analysis, and algebra. He proposes to derive corollaries of the Catlin-D'Angelo isometric imbedding theorem for holomorphic bundles, and to extend the result to certain degenerate metrics. This work bears directly on the problem of classifying proper holomorphic mappings between balls in different dimensions. The complex variables version of Hilbert's seventeenth problem already proved has the following consequence. Suppose one is given a polynomial on complex Euclidean space that does not vanish on the closed unit ball. This polynomial must then be the denominator of a rational proper mapping (reduced to lowest terms) between balls, but the target dimension needs to be chosen sufficiently large. Thus restricting the target dimension constrains the complexity of a proper map between balls. Work of Faran gives further evidence of this. D'Angelo seeks to prove a general theorem providing a sharp bound for the degree of a proper rational mapping between unit balls in different dimensions. This will provide evidence for a more general conjecture about CR mappings between CR manifolds of different dimensions.<br/><br/>In his famous address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert posed a series of research problems that have greatly influenced the development of mathematics in this century. Artin solved Hilbert's original Seventeenth Problem around 1925 by proving that a polynomial in several real variables whose values are nonnegative must be a sum of squares of rational functions. The natural analogue of this result for polynomials of several complex variables does not hold. Given the importance of complex variable theory in physics, engineering, and pure mathematics, it is natural to consider other facsimiles of Hilbert's problem for complex polynomials. In recent years, D'Angelo discovered that such analogues play a crucial role in the study of objects known as ""proper mappings"" between balls in different complex dimensions. D'Angelo and Catlin later established a version of Artin's theorem in the complex setting. Its application to proper mappings enables one to understand the role of the unit sphere in higher dimensions and thus furnishes a multidimensional tool for the study of electrostatics, diffusion, and fluid flow. More recently, Catlin and D'Angelo have proved a major result that generalizes their earlier theorems by casting them in an abstract framework, the framework of so-called holomorphic vector bundles. The proof gives an unexpected application of the Bergman kernel function (a part of analysis) to a problem in algebra, as well as a geometric reinterpretation of Hilbert's problem. The result may have considerable significance for the parts of modern mathematical physics (such as string theory and supersymmetry) where holomorphic vector bundles play a large role. D'Angelo is the 1999 winner of the Bergman Prize, and this work is mentioned in the citation. D'Angelo's current proposal suggests various extensions of and applications for these ideas.<br/>"

One portion of the research will address one of the most difficult open problems in wavelet theory; namely, the development of a general framework for the construction of nonseparable orthogonal wavelets and multiwavelets in higher dimensions. The starting point is the recent time-domain characterization by the PI of the accuracy conditions for multidimensional multiscaling functions under an arbitrary dilation matrix. Combined with insights from self-similarity and iterated function systems, this suggests the possibility of weak substitutes for the factorizations that play the key role in one-dimensional constructions.  The second portion of the research concerns frames in Banach spaces, especially Gabor or windowed Fourier frames. Issues for Gabor systems arising from the interaction between algebra and analysis will be addressed, and Gabor frame decompositions will be applied to analyze pseudodifferential and other operators, utilizing the principle that Gabor frames provide unconditional decompositions for the class of function spaces known as the modulation spaces.<br/><br/>This project addresses the mathematics underlying the processing and analysis of signals, such as images, music, and speech, but also more abstract types of signals. A signal can be processed by first breaking it down into simple, basic units and then manipulating those units in several different ways. This can be done in a nonredundant fashion, where each basic unit is independent of the others and contains one essential part of the total signal, or it can be done in a redundant way, where the information contained in different basic units overlaps. Nonredundant decompositions (""bases"") may provide the most compact representation of a signal, whereas redundant decompositions (""frames"") allow reconstruction of the signal even if some of the basic units are lost in transmission. The objective of this research is to construct and apply both types of decompositions in various settings. Wavelet bases in higher dimensions are especially suitable for the analysis of images. Gabor frames are related to decompositions that have been used throughout mathematics, quantum mechanics, and signal processing, and will be applied in this project to the analysis of operators, or transformations, of signals.<br/>"

The properties on which she will focus are the growth of the solutions, and the location and distribution of the zeros of the solutions. Steinbart is interested in developing and refining analytical tools which can be applied to both linear and nonlinear complex differential equations.

The goal of this research is to contribute to the theory of differential equations by uncovering information regarding the behavior of the solutions of the equations based on the data included in the differential equations themselves. If mathematicians can obtain a deeper understanding of the behavior of the solutions of the equations, then applied scientists who routinely use them will be able to construct their models more effectively.

The objects of study are related to wave equations, to Fourier integral, restriction and maximal operators and to eigenfunctions of pseudo-differential operators on compact manifolds. The first set of problems are of a discrete nature in the sense that properties of integer lattice points are crucial to them and are exploited by methods for exponential sums such as the Hardy-Littlewood method. The underlying space is the flat torus or its dual, the set of lattice points itself. Similar problems are considered in the settings of a smooth manifold, the usual ""curvature"" conditions replaced by assuming only that the objects are typical (generic) elements of the family. Techniques of singularity theory are brought into play to establish decay properties of the corresponding oscillatory integrals.<br/><br/>In more general terms, this project focuses on problems of analysis that stem from partial differential equations of fundamental importance in nature; namely, the Schrodinger equation governing the evolution of states of physical systems at microscopic scales and the wave equation describing the propagation of light and acoustic waves. The project aims especially at those situations where purely analytic techniques seem to be inadequate and deeper understanding can be achieved only by incorporating methods and results from different fields of mathematics, analytic number theory and singularity theory to name just two. Classical harmonic analysis has been a very succesful mathematical tool for describing the aforementioned physical phenomena but is completely effective in rather restricted circumstances. The proposed project is part of a vast program that has been implemented over the past three decades to enrich the classical theory and to extend its range of applicability<br/>"

Koss will concentrate on systems that can be realized as factors of one-sided Bernoulli shifts where points are identified with respect to a group action. In particular, the research will focus on finding independent generating partitions that give an isomorphism to a one-sided Bernoulli shift of maximal entropy for complex toral endomorphisms, rational maps of the sphere with parabolic orbifold, and Ueda maps of complex projective space. Koss will also investigate whether a group factor of a one-sided Bernoulli shift must be one-sided Bernoulli.<br/><br/>The field of dynamical systems is the study of how systems change over time. It has many applications to physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and computer science, such as describing the motion of planets, the change of population in a certain species, or the errors that can occur in the transmission of computer data. The study of chaotic or random behavior in dynamical systems is an exciting and relatively new area, and many mathematical tools have been developed to distinguish between different types of random processes. This project involves an exploration to discover systems that exhibit maximal random behavior, meaning those that can be modeled by the toss of a fair die. In addition to its inherent mathematical interest, this research represents one step towards a more thorough understanding of chaotic behavior, which in turn can help with the construction of more accurate models for predicting outcomes in the physical world.<br/>"

Stout, of the theory of boundary values (in the sense of hyperfunctions). Indeed, the two have started developing an entirely new theory of boundary values. This is research in function theory, with strong connections to several complex variables and partial differential equations. Rosay's project also entails the continuation of his study of various questions on the dynamics of biholomorphisms of complex n-space (collaborations with P. Ahern and F. Forstneric). Several other topics (e.g., uniqueness in the Cauchy problem, the nonlinear d-bar equation) will also be explored.<br/><br/>Rosay's main area of activity is the theory of functions of several complex variables. This field is a central one in mathematics, with direct ties to such areas as approximation theory and partial differential equations that are very close to immediate applications (e.g., image processing, modeling, scientific computation). It should be stressed that mathematical results that may at first glance look quite abstract can in fact lead to very practical applications, by creating the possibility of new computational tools. (Even if, as usual in fundamental science, benefits may take many years to surface.) In order to illustrate how a shift from what seems to be purely theoretical to something more applied or at least applicable is possible, one need look no further than the present project for an example. Stout and Rosay recently gave a totally new proof of a very classical and fundamental theorem known as the Paley-Wiener theorem. This new proof was unlikely to be found in the classical setting, because the approach only became natural in the generalized and more abstract setting of ""analytic functionals."" However, despite the fact that it arose in a generalized setting, it turns out that the new proof is constructive in nature, and therefore much more closely linked to the possibility of practical computations. From one perspective, this development is not so surprising. It has been known for centuries that the full explanation of many basic mathematical phenomena (as fundamental as the convergence of power series expansion) is to be found only in the realm of complex numbers. It has likewise been known for centuries that many computations are best done with complex variables, even if one is interested in a final answer expressed in terms of real numbers. Of course, no more so than in any other science can one claim that all the research in the field of complex analysis will lead to applications, and often the applications that are found will come as complete surprises. But complex analysis clearly furnishes an essential tool to both pure and applied mathematicians.<br/>"

We take rhinoplasty (plastic surgery of the  nose) to be a microcosm of many typical plastic surgery problems. For  the nose has an interesting and complex three-dimensional anatomy, and  it also plays a critical role in the aesthetics of the face. The nose  is of interest as a differential geometric object.  Its exterior  dermis is a hypersurface in space, and the nature of the nose is  determined (i) by its curvatures and (ii) by its deviations as  measured by quasiconformal mappings from certain standard geometric  forms.  Clinical experience indicates that reforming a convex surface  into another convex surface is one of the easiest procedures for a  plastic surgeon to perform.  The most difficult surfaces to handle are  surfaces of negative curvature; of course the typical nose has such  surfaces on either side, near the nostrils.  Preliminary discussions  indicate that quasiconformal mappings may be one way to measure  deviation from convexity, or distance from a negatively curved dermal  surface to a positively curved one.  The final goal of the project create software that will assist the plastic surgeon in developing medical procedures.  The software that we propose to create  will take a respected but largely non-scientific part of medicine and  endeavor to make it analytical. The physician will input either numerical data, taken from measuring the patient's organ, or will  scan in data with a suitable digitizing device.  The software will  solve an optimization problem and make a procedural recommendation.  Of course the final decisions, and the interpretation, will be made  by the plastic surgeon.<br/><br/>   Plastic surgery in general, and aesthetic rhinoplasty in particular, is a rapidly developing area of medical technique and treatment.  Laser surgery, microstitching, tissue transplants,  man-made implants, and many other devices are now important (and  quite recently developed) tools in the field.  Definitive studies of  aesthetic rhinoplasty concentrate on techniques that center around  ""aesthetics"", ""perspective"", and ""balance"". In short, technique in aesthetic rhinoplasty, even at a very sophisticated level, is a  sort of intuition informed by experience and by an artistic sense. To  the extent that technology and mathematics are used in the process,  they are used only in the pre-diagnosis stages, and only for  descriptive purposes.  Our goal in this project is to use a  mathematical analysis of the nasal surface (and, ultimately, of other  organs as well) to inform the plastic surgeon as he plans a surgical  procedure.  The specific short-term goal is to create a mathematical  model of the nose, formulated in the language of the differential  geometry of surfaces. The broader, long-term goal is to formulate  questions of plastic surgery procedure as optimization problems for  surfaces imbedded in space.  In the final analysis, the questions  that the plastic surgeon considers are surface design problems.  And  surface design has, in the last ten years, entered a new era of  sophistication.  Our goal is to examine the hitherto unexplored  subject of local surface design problems in plastic surgery using  techniques of analysis and differential geometry.  We will create  software for use by the plastic surgeon in assessing  analytic/geometric data of the nasal and facial surfaces and  formulating an operative procedure.          <br/>"

The <br/>principal investigator will examine these Hermite functions, their relationship to questions in harmonic analysis and representation theory, and <br/>properties of transforms relating function spaces on Lie groups to other Hilbert spaces. Specifically, the principal investigator proposes to <br/>extend his recent work by characterizing the asymptotic behavior of Hermite functions, investigating their image under the Segal-Bargmann-<br/>Hall Transform, and relating the Hermite functions on compact Lie groups and their complexifications to the unitary representations of these <br/>groups.

Planar algebras are best defined as algebras over the planar operad-the operad consisting of isotopy classes of planar tangles which are collections of disjoint discs inside a large disc connected up by smooth curves called strings. It is a remarkable theorem of Popa and myself that, together with suitable positivity conditions, a planar algebra is equivalent to a subfactor of finite index of a Murray-von Neumann type II_1 factor on a separable Hilbert space. The proof has analytic, algebraic and topological aspects and needs to be better understood but it is the wealth of examples and potential new examples that is the current reason for excitement. The quanum invariants of links and three manifolds admit a unified treatment as does the duality which allows one to locate critical points in various statistical mechanical models starting with the Ising model. The van Kampen diagrams of the theory of finitely generated come naturally from planar algebra considerations and Connes' cyclic category can be defined very simply as certain annular tangles. Bisch and myself discovered an entirely new kind of planar algebra called the Fuss-Catalan algebra by exploiting the connection with subfactors. This algebra has been used to construct a ""new"" solvable model in statistical mechanics. New algebras using variations of this method are just around the corner.<br/><br/>  The aim of this research project is to develop and exploit connections between various branches of science related to objects called ""planar algebras"". A planar algebra is a mathematical structure based on diagrams reminiscent of electronic circuits. There are inputs and outputs all connected with a system of wires that are not allowed to cross and so could be engraved on a surface.  Models of statistical mechanics in two dimensions give examples of planar algebras and vice versa. Knots in three dimensional space can be projected onto the plane and the resulting picture consists of crossings - the inputs-tied together by non crossing strings. One obtains as output the theory of polynomial invariants of knots which have been used by molecular biologists in the study of DNA molecules. Indeed the planar diagrams resemble some of the models used to study DNA recombination. It is quite extraordinary that these planar algebras are, under the assumption of what physicists call ""reflection positivity"", equivalent to a theory of certain von Neumann algebras which themselves are collections of operators in Hilbert space devised by von Neumann to be used in quantum mechanics.<br/>"

My point of departure will be the ideas of Alain Connes concerning quantum Riemannian manifolds. My emphasis will be on extending to quantum spaces, in the operator algebras setting, the notion of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces. I expect to apply this theory to the many situations already in view in the physics and mathematics of quantization where one has a sequence of quantum spaces which appear to be converging to another space, either quantum or classical. In most such situations of which I am aware, the present notions of convergence are either just heuristic, or quite weak. I believe that a quantum Gromov-Hausdorff convergence can often be applied to give a stronger form of convergence. Examples range from approximation by finite dimensional algebras such as frequently occurs in Berezin-Toeplitz quantization, to approximation of quantum field-theory models, especially those of integrable systems, say by lattice models, all the way to the hypothesized ""M-theory"" of string theory and its (hypothesized) approximation by ""Matrix theory"".<br/><br/>Our nation's technological and economic success has at its foundation the mathematical models of the world around us which scientists develop in order to understand how to use the flood of data which flows from the laboratories of the experimental scientists. But human beings and computers can only deal with finite collections of numbers at a time.  Thus in applying these mathematical models it is almost always necessary to approximate the infinite variability of our world by finite collections of numbers. It is then crucial to understand how valid any given approximation is. With respect to individual calculations this matter has received extensive study. But less study has been made of how complex models as a whole can be approximated well by simpler models as a whole. Relatively little is known about such ""global"" approximations in the case of the models of quantum physics, which is the part of physics which governs chemical and biochemical reactions, the functioning of semi-conductors, and many other key technologies. I propose to extend to the quantum realm one form of global approximation, called Gromov-Hausdorff distance, which has in recent years proved to be quite powerful in the classical realm for dealing with certain broad classes of mathematical situations. I expect to apply this global approximation method to better understand how to effectively approximate various models of quantum phenomena of current interest.<br/><br/>"

The main goals in this study are to classify simple compact quantum groups and their representations, and to investigate quantum isometry groups of non-commutative spaces. A part of the project is to make precise the notions of simple compact quantum groups and quantum isometry groups. <br/>As a first important application, the quantum isometry group of Connes' finite space for the <br/>Standard Model of particle physics will be studied. As another application of ideas from quantum groups, a new approach to the well known problem of constructing ergodic actions of compact simple group on the Murray-von Neumann factor will be examined. <br/><br/>There are various kinds of symmetries in nature.  A square or a star shaped object have the simplest symmetries. To systematically study more complex symmetries, mathematicians discovered a notion, called a group, which provided the most effective way to encode the symmetries of interest.  Lie groups form one of the most important classes of groups. They are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics.  However, it began to be apparent that groups are inadequate in many important situations.  In the mid 80's, mathematicians and physicists discovered a new notion, called a quantum group, to meet this challenge.  A quantum group is not a group in general, but it encodes more general symmetries than a group.  Quantum groups are very useful in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, as well as non-commutative geometry and other fields of mathematics. The most natural examples of quantum groups are deformations (in a technical sense) of Lie groups.  More recently, the author of this project discovered several new classes of quantum groups that are not deformations of Lie groups. Because of the discoveries of the author, it becomes a paramount problem to classify simple quantum groups, which are the building blocks of quantum groups.   The main goals in this project are to tackle this problem and to apply simple quantum groups to various problems in closely related branches of mathematics and physics.  We believe that successful solutions of the problems in this project will not only bring us to a new horizon in the theory of quantum groups, but they will also have wide impact in other fields of mathematics and physics. <br/><br/>"

McCullough<br/><br/>Abstract: McCullough plans to investigate several related problems in functional analysis and operator theory. A common theme is the dilation of operators and the concomitant lifting of intertwining maps -- commutant lifting, as it is called -- and the special cases of interpolation of  Nevanlinna-Pick and Caratheodory type. Nevanlinna-Pick kernels, also known as NP kernels, were introduced by Agler as a natural generalization of the Szego kernel. Examples include the Dirichlet kernel, kernels nearly equal the Szego kernel on a multiply connected domain, and the kernels over the ball for Fock space. Dilation and commutant lifting results that parallel classical results hold for these kernels, including commutant lifting for bundle shifts over a two-holed domain. A number of issues for NP kernels and multiply connected domains remain unresolved. All function theoretic objects over a multiply connected domain can be described in terms of theta functions. From the trisecant identity, in combination with with knowledge of the zeros of theta functions, it follows that for any given scalar valued Nevanlinna-Pick problem over an annulus it suffices to consider just two kernels, which are explicitly determined from the data. Theta functions will be used to investigate additional problems over the annulus and more general multiply connected domains. The extremal elements (roughly what an algebraist would term projective elements) of an Agler family of operators are the natural objects to which to lift or dilate generic members of the family. Families for which the extremals are C*-closed, such as the families of contractions, isometries, and subnormal contractions, are particularly nice from a model theoretic viewpoint. This is not the case for the hyponormal contractions nor for the numerical radius contractions, where the extremals are a proper subset of the family but the C*-closure of the extremals is the entire family. A good measure of the divergence of the extremals from their C*-closure does not yet exist.<br/><br/>A common mathematical problem that arises in physics and engineering is to determine whether certain partial information is consistent with a favorable whole. For instance, certain seismographic information indicates the presence of oil reserves, while other seismic data are not pertinent to the question. Similarly, in the design of an electrical circuit there are often several competing design criteria from which one must select the relevant ones. These problems can also be viewed as representing given information in a nice way as a part of a larger, more coherent whole. McCullough will investigate new stategies for imbedding the ""partial"" into the ""whole,"" and conduct a search for a cohesive theory unifying many different applications. This will be done in the framework of the mathematical field known as operator theory. The underlying mathematics is quite similar to that used in digital technology and automatic controlers such as autopilots.<br/>"

Subfactors with finite Jones index have an amazingly rich mathematical structure and an interplay of analytical, algebraic-combinatorial and topological techniques is intrinsic to the theory. Planar algebra methods will be used to investigate the structure of subfactors and their standard invariants. In pioneering work, Bisch and Jones have used these techniques to prove a general structure theorem for subfactors that leads to a classification of singly generated planar algebras with small dimension.  It is planned to take this classification one step further by studying a generalized quantum Yang-Baxter equation. New towers of algebras are expected to appear in this analysis. The notion of free product of two planar algebras will be investigated and various natural graded algebra structures on a planar algebra will be examined. Other directions of the project include work on rigidity of subfactors and the investigation of sub-systems of Popa systems.<br/><br/>The theory of operator algebras, of which subfactor theory is a branch, has been introduced by John von Neumann to provide an adequate mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. For instance, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation appears as a natural consequence of the properties of the abstract mathematical objects that von Neumann invented. It has become increasingly clear in the last few years that classical mathematical structures, such as groups, are not always sufficient to capture all the relevant symmetries present in a mathematical or physical situation, especially in the context of quantum field theory. A subfactor can be viewed as a mathematical object with which one can capture what one might call the quantum symmetries of the problem under investigation. Subfactor techniques can then be applied to describe these symmetries explicitly in algebraic-combinatorial terms.  For instance, certain graphs appear as part of this data. Many surprising applications of the theory of subfactors to several areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, for instance knot theory and conformal field theory, have been found in this way. Subfactors have thus contributed in an important way to the understanding of naturally occurring structures in these a priori quite distinct areas of mathematics and physics.<br/>"

Boshernitan's approach, unlike the ""global"" approaches of others, puts special emphasis on the way diophantine and algebraic properties of the parameters involved may affect the dynamical properties of an iet  (or an itm). (The diophantine properties considered are often ""generic,"" leading to ""global"" results.) For some dynamical systems of topological entropy zero, an accurate asymptotic estimate on the corresponding ""block growth"" is needed that is better than merely subexponential, and in some cases, is even polynomial. These problems are often difficult, more difficult than in the measure-theoretic setting, and many presently available positive results in this direction (of Katok, Yomdin, Gutkin, Haydn, Goetz, and others) are generally believed to be far from best possible. For example, even for itm's, the conjecture on linear block growth (which is supported by computer computations) remains open, and an affirmative resolution of the conjecture would have important consequences. Boshernitzan is also involved in the study of dynamical systems  (symbolic flows) of low (in particular, of linear) complexity, as well as various strengthenings of the notion of unique ergodicity tailored to this context, as found in the work of Ferenczi, Cassaigne, Durand, and others.<br/>   <br/>Even though the emphasis of this project is on theoretical questions that arise in the study  of dynamical systems of low complexity, there are numerous natural connections with other fields of mathematics (number theory, probability, and combinatorics, to name three), as well as with statistics, computer science (complexity theory, for one) and physics (quantum mechanics).

Nahmod<br/><br/>Abstract: Nahmod's project aims at studying specific problems in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations that arise when smoothness conditions on the domain or the operations are relaxed to conform with a more natural physical setting. The first part concentrates on the study of the boundary unique continuation property for the Laplace operator on irregular domains. This property is a boundary version of the classical interior unique continuation property for elliptic operators, and is closely related to results on nodal sets of eigenfunctions. Basically nothing is known for nonsmooth-nonconvex-domains. This project will investigate whether or not Lipschitz domains have the boundary unique continuation property. It is first approached by considering a special case, the Bang-Bang Principle of control theory, which is of interest in its own right. The second part focuses on the study of bilinear operators associated to nonsmooth symbols that arise in the context of compensated compactness and are also related to Calderon's commutators. Nonlinearity in certain partial differential equations prevents direct use of weak continuity arguments to ensure the convergence of approximating solutions. Compensated compactness was developed to overcome this difficulty by exploiting cancellation properties and a priori bounds of certain associated nonlinear quantities, usually bilinear. The aim of this project is to establish a comprehensive criterion in one dimension for bilinear operators with nonsmooth symbols to map into some Hardy space. The approach is via a delicate use of time-frequency analysis, as pioneered by C. Fefferman and later successfully exploited by Lacey and Thiele. A concurrent aim of the project is to both develop and gain a greater understanding of the ideas and decompositions involved in the analysis with the goal of making these techniques more readily applicable in other specific contexts. <br/><br/>Partial differential equations, the ultimate object of study in Nahmod's project, are the mathematical models of the laws governing many phenomena in our physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is to study the behaviour of their solutions, provide the tools to extract quantitative and qualitative information about them, and lay the foundations upon which methods to approximate the solutions with reasonable accuracy are developed. Time-frequency analysis, one of the key methods to be employed by Nahmod, consists in decomposing complex objects into basic building blocks (via a collection of ""modulated waveforms"") that are localized and easy to understand, and then piecing them back together in a straightforward manner. A time-frequency analysis of a problem can be likened to a musical score. The modulated waveforms (the notes) have four attributes: amplitude (loudness), scale (duration), frequency (pitch) and position (instant it is played). The object that the full ""time-frequency composition"" portrays might, for example, be speech, a radar signal, or a fingerprint, but might also be a more abstract oscillatory expression arising in optics, acoustic scattering, and wave propagation problems. This type of analysis is closely related to the theory of wavelets. Its impact is both theoretical and computational for its potential to implement the ideas developed in harmonic analysis to produce fast computational algorithms for operations which, due to their nonlocal nature, are otherwise expensive to compute numerically.<br/><br/><br/>"

This research started with the discovery by Michael Lacey and the Principal Investigator of the boundedness of the bilinear Hilbert transform on various L^p spaces. Their approach to this work, which answered a long-standing question of Alberto Calderon, exploited methods of time-frequency analysis similar to those found in Lennart Carleson's and Charles Fefferman's proofs of almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series. More recent results in this area include boundedness of the maximal truncated bilinear Hilbert transform, boundedness of the bisublinear maximal operator, and certain uniform estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform, which yield a new proof for the boundedness of Calderon's first commutator. Research topics for this project include, but are by no means limited to, an extension of the aforementioned results from bilinear to multilinear singular integrals, as well as from the one-dimensional setting to higher dimensions.<br/><br/>This project lies in the field of analysis, which has been a central area of mathematics ever since the emergence of rigorous mathematics in the last century. More precisely, the project focuses on localized Fourier analysis, a theory that is readily described to any musician. In the same way that a musical score describes an intricate composition by breaking it down into its elementary units, notes that have specified location, duration and frequency, localized Fourier analysis synthesizes complicated mathematical functions from elementary pieces, each of which is a relatively simple function that has its characteristic time, duration, and frequency. It should come as no great surprise, therefore, that localized Fourier analysis has been applied so successfully in the automated processing of acoustic data. The specific topics in this project arose from and will have impact on the study of nonlinear problems in partial differential equations, a branch of mathematics with ever growing importance in engineering and the physical sciences. In particular, solutions to the problems under investigation could have implications for such concrete areas as data compression, signal processing, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>"

The maximal possible number of limit cycles in this context is called a ""Hilbert number."" The existence of this number has not yet been proved even for degree two vector fields. There exist various analogs and simplifications of the problem proposed by Arnold, Ilyashenko, Pugh and others. Each of these simplified versions requires an upper estimate of the maximal possible number of limit cycles in some specific class of differential equations. This class depends on a parameter which is typically a degree of some polynomial involved in the definition of the class. The required quantities are called ""Hilbert type numbers."" The present project deals with Abel and Lienard equations, quadratic vector fields, and zeros of Abelian integrals. Related simplified versions of the Hilbert 16th problem were stated during last three decades, but with very few exceptions, they too remain unsolved. The main objective of this project is to give some upper estimates of  ""Hilbert type numbers,"" not for the whole class for which these numbers are defined, but for some reduced set of equations. On the one hand, these estimates should greatly extend our present knowledge. On the other hand, they will hopefully provide tools for finding explicit upper estimates for analogs of the Hilbert numbers in their original setting.<br/><br/>At the beginning of this century, Hilbert presented a list of problems intended to predict the development of mathematics over the course of the ensuing hundred years. Now, at the end of the century, it is clear that his prediction was correct. For the most part, the Hilbert problems have been solved, and their solutions are highlights in the recent  history of mathematics. Some of the problems, however, remain unsolved. Among these is the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem.  It requires an upper estimate for some quantitative geometric characteristics of polynomial differential equations in the plane.  These characteristics are called ""Hilbert numbers."" Not a single Hilbert number has been found up to the present time, despite tremendous efforts by brilliant mathematicians throughout the century. It is clear now that the way to the solution must proceed through simplifications of the problem. Simplified problems require estimations for the same geometric characteristics, but for classes of equations which are less complicated than those in the original Hilbert problem. It is the hope that solutions to these simplified versions will furnish tools for attacking the original problem. The beauty of planar differential equations is that questions and answers in this theory can be illustrated by pictures understandable to a broad audience. On the other hand, the solutions may involve deep results from different domains of mathematics like algebraic geometry, complex analysis, topology and so on. The methods developed in the theory of planar differential equations find numerous applications on the boundary of mathematics with other disciplines such as catastrophe theory, applied mathematics, biological modelling, etc. For this reason, the subject is attractive to young mathematicians, some of whom (including students of the Principal Investigator) have made significant contributions to the field. <br/>"

One goal is to continue the study of cocycles with values in Lie groups and in diffeomorphism groups over hyperbolic actions. In particular we would like to generalize Livsic's cohomological result, as well as the cohomological results of Katok-Spatzier and Katok-Nitica-Torok, about higher-rank abelian actions to various classes of non-abelian cocycles. The second goal is to use cohomological results as a tool in the rigidity theory of hyperbolic or partially hyperbolic abelian group actions, and higher rank lattice actions on compact manifolds. This goal is part of the rigidity program initiated by Zimmer, and developed by Hurder, Katok, Lewis, Margulis, Nitica, Qian, Spatzier, Torok, Zimmer, and others. The third goal is to find generic classes of partially hyperbolic transformations with interesting dynamic and stochastic properties. This is part of a program initiated by Pugh and Shub. The aim of the program is to show that stably ergodicity occurs much more frequently than expected, and that some partial hyperbolicity is sufficient to prove stably ergodicity. We are mostly interested in skew-products and perturbations of skew-products. This project targets the field of dynamical systems. <br/><br/>The theory of dynamical systems is a major mathematical discipline that is intertwined to all the other areas of mathematics. Concepts coming from dynamical systems have inspired researchers from other sciences (e.g., statistics, mathematical physics, biology, engineering). They also stimulated the emergence of a new area called nonlinear dynamics, or chaos theory. An important feature of the well understood examples with chaotic dynamics is the presence of hyperbolicity (i.e., expansion and contraction). Many natural examples of dynamical systems that appear from practical applications exhibit only partial hyperbolicity. One of the goals of the proposed research is to show that one can find chaotic behavior for these examples as well. Another goal is to find obstructions to chaotic behavior for partially hyperbolic systems."

The basic idea behind nonlinear approximation is that the elements used in the approximation do not come from a fixed linear space but are allowed to depend on the function being approximated. While the scope of our proposal is mostly theoretical, we should note that this form of approximation appears in many numerical applications such as adaptive PDE solvers, compression of images and signals, statistical classification, and so on. The standard problem in this regard is the problem of m-term approximation where one fixes a basis and looks to approximate a target function by a linear combination of m terms of the basis. When the basis is a wavelet basis or a basis of other waveforms, then this type of approximation is the starting point for compression algorithms. We are interested in the quantitative aspects of this type of approximation. Namely, we want to understand the properties (usually smoothness) of the function which govern its rate of approximation in some given norm (or metric). We are also interested in stable algorithms for finding good or near best approximations using m terms. Some of our earlier work has introduced and analyzed such algorithms. More recently, there has emerged another more complicated form of nonlinear approximation which we call highly nonlinear approximation. It takes many forms but has the basic ingredient that a basis is replaced by a larger system of functions that is usually redundant. Some types of approximation that fall into this general category are mathematical frames, adaptive pursuit (or greedy algorithms) and adaptive basis selection. Redundancy on the one hand offers much promise for greater efficiency in terms of approximation rate, but on the other hand gives rise to highly nontrivial theoretical and practical problems. With this motivation, our recent work and the current proposal focuses on nonlinear approximation both in the classical form of m-term approximation (where several important problems remain unsolved) and in the form<br/> of highly nonlinear approximation where a theory is only now emerging.<br/><br/>Nonlinear approximation seeks ways to approximate complicated functions by simple functions using methods that depend nonlinearly on the function being approximated. Such methods of approximation are more flexible than traditional linear approximation methods and proved to be very useful in various applications such as image compression, signal processing, design of neural networks, and the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. The purpose of the proposed research is to continue investigations of nonlinear approximation. Emphasis will be placed on studying the efficiency of algorithms which are important in practical applications. Implementation of these algorithms may substantially reduce time for signal and image prosessing. This is important for automated target recognition and related applications including autonomous landing of aircraft and registration of images from a database."
