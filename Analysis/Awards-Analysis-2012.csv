"1259311","Thermodynamic Formalism and Dynamical Systems Arising from Geometry","DMS","ANALYSIS PROGRAM","07/01/2012","09/24/2012","Daniel Thompson","OH","Ohio State University","Standard Grant","Bruce P. Palka","06/30/2015","$59,487.00","","thompson.2455@osu.edu","1960 KENNY RD","COLUMBUS","OH","432101016","6146888735","MPS","1281","","$0.00","The key aims of this research are to further develop the theory of thermodynamic formalism and to apply powerful techniques from ergodic theory and dynamical systems to examples of special geometric interest. Thermodynamic formalism is a powerful and versatile tool in the study of the global statistical properties of dynamical systems, originally motivated by ideas from statistical mechanics. Key goals of the project are (1) to study the evolution of dynamical invariants of negatively curved manifolds under Ricci flow, (2) to develop thermodynamic techniques to study the beta-transformation and related maps, (3) to develop thermodynamic formalism for the Teichmueller flow.<br/> <br/>Since the 1930?s, a key motivation in the development of the ergodic theory of dynamical systems has been the study of problems in geometry. This project belongs to that rich tradition, and covers a selection of problems where state of the art techniques will produce new results at the intersection of dynamical systems and geometry. The investigation of the effect of Ricci flow on dynamical invariants of negative curvature manifolds combines the powerful techniques of smooth dynamical systems with state of the art innovations from the Ricci flow literature. The beta-transformation, which has been studied extensively since 1957, arises naturally in number theory. New results are now possible due to a recent breakthrough co-authored by the Principal Investigator. Teichmueller theory is an area of intensive current research at the intersection of geometry, topology, number theory and dynamics. There is great scope for the development of thermodynamic formalism for systems arising in this context, and the results will be useful for a variety of geometric and statistical applications. The project will both advance the theory of dynamical systems and build connections between different branches of mathematics (dynamics, PDE, number theory, Teichmueller theory). The focus of this research is on deriving fundamental pure results, so there is significant potential that the tools developed here will yield future applications in dynamics, geometry and beyond. In addition, the project has a number of educational benefits. The Principle Investigator will (1) disseminate the research through publications and talks, (2) integrate research with teaching by delivering mini-courses and seminars for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, (3) work with Penn State Outreach to promote learning and participation at the K-12 level, with particular emphasis on underrepresented groups."

A main theme of this proposal is the investigation of certain ""coordinate systems"" for Banach spaces, e.g. bases, frames, and dictionaries. One of the problems considered is an old one from harmonic analysis, which asks whether the space of p-integrable functions on the real line has a basis formed by translates of the same element. It is intended to attack this problem with tools from the theory of Banach spaces. Another prominent problem is the embedding of Banach spaces into Banach spaces with an additional structure, for example into Banach spaces with very few operators. The principal investigator intends to bring to bear here the method of infinite asymptotic games, which he developed in collaboration with E. Odell. A particularly important problem, especially in the context of the famous invariant subspace problem, is the question whether there are reflexive spaces with very few operators.<br/> <br/>The principal investigator intends to work on longstanding problems in the structure theory of Banach spaces, many of them either originating from, or being related to other area of mathematics such as applied areas like signal processing and data compression or rather theroretical areas like set theory, harmonic analysis, and approximation theory. The techniques to be employed will involve a combination of analysis, geometry, infinite combinatorics, and logic. The proposed work could also spur further development in these latter areas.  Several parts of this proposal deal with issues originating in signal processing and data compression. Here one looks for bases, frames, or, more generally dictionaries of spaces, in which (certain) vectors can be approximated by vectors with few non zero coordinates, using easily implementable algorithms, so that the representation satisfies certain stability conditions. Recent work on band limited functions by the investigator generated an interesting and potentially fruitful line of investigation in the interface between convex geometry and harmonic analysis."

There are two distinct main themes that share the theory of weights as a common thread.  The first theme aims to further develop the theory of weighted inequalities in the multilinear setting.  This theory, while still in its adolescence, is expected to have significant ramifications to several multilinear operators.  For example it may be used to improve the known bounds of the bilinear Hilbert transform and related bilinear maximal function; an emphasis of study will be to develop multilinear extrapolation techniques.  The second theme focuses on the regularity of solutions to degenerate p-Laplacian equations. Such equations arise naturally in the study of mappings of bounded distortion (quasiconformal mappings) and more generally mappings of finite distortion.  Considering distortion functions that belong to certain classes of weights allows one to work below the natural size assumptions, yet still obtain interesting regularity results.  The common thread between the two motifs is the theory of weights.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project contributes to the long-standing synergy between the two fields of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, in particular to the study of nonlinear quantities. In the present setting such nonlinear terms correspond to mappings of finite distortion that are relevant within the pure mathematics realm and also have far-reaching applications to other sciences, such as physics and engineering; materials sciences; hydrodynamics; and medical imaging. Moen will continue to establish fruitful collaborations both nationally and abroad, and the outcomes will be disseminated through publications of research articles, as well as presentations at professional meetings. Moen will integrate this research project with education, mentoring, and community outreach. In particular, he plans to continue his community involvement by establishing outreach programs that will connect local grade schools with the University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa."

The PI will focus on a variety of applications of the theory to questions that arise in a natural way in geometric analysis. More specifically the PI and his graduate students that are included in the project will study approximation of convex and subharmonic functions, the Liouville theorem for conformal mappings, Sobolev embedding theorems in irregular domains, Sobolev spaces on metric spaces, approximation of Sobolev mappings into metric spaces, the Lipschitz homotopy groups of the Heisenberg group and the Gromov conjecture about Holder continuous homeomorphisms of the Heisenberg group. The project, however, will not be restricted to these topics. Many new questions will emerge and some questions will have to be modified as a result of the investigation.<br/><br/>The proposed research lies on the borderline of many areas of contemporary mathematics. When successful, it will create bridges between different areas of mathematics such as analysis, calculus of variations, topology, sub-Riemannian geometry, nonlinear elasticity and even numerical analysis. An important part of the project is to train graduate students and young scholars in these areas. The wide collaboration of the PI will strengthen scientific partnerships of research institutions within the U.S. and overseas.

The research scope of the proposal is both broad and coherent, interwoven by common themes and ideas. The harmonic analysis research topics include classical questions on Fourier multipliers, restriction of Fourier transforms and the interplay of sub-Riemannian geometry and analysis. In mathematical fluid dynamics, the research will focus on regularity and blow up problems for active scalars, on investigating realistic models of atmospheric dynamics building upon the classical Boussinesq system, and on mixing problems that lie on the interface of partial differential equations, dynamical systems and probability. In mathematical biology, we will work on reaction networks that model a broad range of processes in biochemistry, systems biology and ecology, and on applications of chemotaxis to enhancement of biological reactions. <br/><br/>The research of this project will be focused on analysis and applications. The applied problems will come from a variety of areas and sciences. There will be applications that involve models used in atmospheric science for weather and climate studies. There will be problems on efficiency of mixing in fluids, of interest in applications ranging from internal combustion modeling to food processing. Finally, there will be problems on reaction networks of interest in biochemistry, and problems on sensing of chemicals by living organisms of interest in ecology and oceanography. The project is designed to give young participants experience and depth necessary to adapt to a variety of career paths and to pursue the most promising directions available. It offers a wide range of teaching and research activities, including summer training programs for incoming graduate students, annual research seminars for graduate students and postdocs, annual research experience programs for undergraduates, research workshops and outreach opportunities. The research experience programs for undergraduates seek to early acquaint students with the excitement of mathematics research and provide leadership training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. Those activities will have a large innovative teaching component during the academic year, and will be followed by intensive research programs in the summer. The graduate research seminars will cover a diverse range of active topics, exposing researchers and students to a mix of advanced analysis techniques along with concrete applied problems where these techniques can be used. The research workshops will serve to broaden the perspective of the trainees and suggest new directions of research. Outreach activities sponsored by the project will include regular mathematics seminars for high-school students, with the participation of RTG trainees. The activities supported by the RTG grant will significantly strengthen the UW mathematics department's research and training programs which contribute to the effort of creating a mathematically skilled workforce.

The major goal of the project is the development of new techniques to achieve breakthroughs in our understanding of fluid dynamics phenomena. The project research will address fundamental properties of the classical equations of fluid dynamics, qualitative properties of solutions, and modeling applications. The project focuses on three main directions. The first set of problems concerns global regularity vs finite time blow up that will be investigated for a range of fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. Axi-symmetric solutions for 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes will be considered, new potentially singular scenarios will be studied and new regularity criteria will be sought. Active scalars, such as surface quasi-geostrophic equation coming from atmospheric science, will also be analyzed -- here the effort will concentrate on studying properties of solutions, search for new Lyapunov functionals and novel regularity estimates. In the second direction, we will seek more detailed information on long time dynamics. This will include research on some long-open conjectures for 2D Euler equation, including possible mechanisms of inverse energy cascade, mixing and small scales formation. We will also work on passive scalar models and mixing properties of flows in this context. Biomixing by chemotaxis will be investigated as well, with an eye towards applications in ecology and marine biology. The third direction focuses on complex fluid models. In many applications - for instance, in studies of particle suspensions or solutions - the microscopic structure of   particles in the fluid becomes important. The shape and interactions between the particles can be taken into account by adding kinetic equations to the fluid dynamics systems and introducing physically natural couplings. Analysis of solutions to such systems, their regularity and qualitative properties will be a part of the project work.<br/><br/>Fluids are ubiquitous in nature, science and engineering. Diverse phenomena involving fluids appear in atmospheric and ocean science, astrophysics, chemistry and biology, and are described by partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. These equations are some of  <br/>the most difficult partial differential equations to analyze. They   describe a wide range of complex phenomena, are nonlinear, and usually   nonlocal. Due to their complexity, even the classical equations such   as 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes are far from well understood. The   proposed research lies at the interface of several central areas of mathematics - partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis and Fourier analysis. This FRG project   brings together several researchers that have been at the forefront of recent developments in mathematical fluid mechanics. Different   participants bring different strengths to the project. It is expected that intensive collaboration within FRG framework will lead to   development of new ideas and approaches and result in a burst of activity in mathematics of fluids. New techniques and tools developed   are likely to have an impact in neighboring areas of mathematics,  biology, and atmospheric science. An important part of the FRG   activity will be training of junior researchers.  Mathematics of fluid  mechanics covers a broad range of effective techniques, which are   applicable beyond fluids. The training activities will include a   summer school, two workshops, group meetings, course development,   research seminars and research projects for advanced undergraduate   students. The principal investigators will advertise all training   activities broadly, and strive to recruit talented, motivated, and   diverse trainees. Special attention will be paid to recruitment of   groups under represented in mathematics."

One such problem consists in studying dimensionality properties of p-Harmonic measure on domains beyond simply-connected ones. A second question deals with generalizations of the Chang-Marshall theorem in space, namely with exponential integrability properties for the trace of analytic functions, and their quasiregular counterparts in higher dimensions, when restricted to the boundary. A third problems studies iteration of analytic functions in one and several dimensions with a focus on the interplay between complex dynamics and the hyperbolic geometry of the unit disk in the complex plane and of the unit ball in higher dimensions.<br/><br/>This research will also draw on the properties of conformal invariants mentioned above to obtain concrete applications in the study of large networks. This is an area that has become more salient with the advent of the internet and the need to analyze large databases (so-called massive data-sets). One example that most people are familiar with is search-engines. The way internet searches work is through random processes that continually sample the web and periodically return averages and other statistics. The simplest such process is called a random crawler or walker and the mathematics that governs its behavior is derived from the study of conformal invariants in geometric function theory. The PI is conducting research that is expected to bring new tools to the task of comparing the behavior of such random processes to the geometry of the data-set. Because of the large applicability of such results the PI will also study the problem of epidemic outbreaks. In this context the PI has already obtained initial funding from the Center for Engagement and Community Development at Kansas State University for a joint project with Professor Scoglio in the Department of Electrical and Computing Engineering and Professor Schumm in the Department of Family Studies. Our team collected data in the city of Chanute, Kansas, and has already built a ""contact"" network, which is now being analyzed using the conformal invariants mentioned above. The ultimate goal is to provide the city of Chanute with a concrete set of directions that could help its city officials mitigate and manage an epidemic outbreak, especially one of zoonotic nature, originating on a farm."

The proposed research explores this connection in two different directions. The graph algebras, introduced by Cuntz and Krieger in 1980, have been generalized and extended in a variety of ways to comprise a large collection of interesting C*-algebras. The investigator, along with collaborator Gabriel Nagy, has recently found a new proof of a generalized Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem. This work has led to their discovery of a class of C*-subalgebras, pseudo-diagonals. One of the defining properties of these classes involves pure state extensions, a topic that has seen a great deal of interest since the Kadison-Singer Problem was first introduced half a century ago. This proposal seeks to further investigate the relationship and parallels between pseudo-diagonals and the other special Cartan-like subalgebras, as well as to answer some related questions about state extensions. On the other hand, one can define a shift space from a directed graph. The investigator intends to analyze the corresponding graph algebras in order to shed light on the famous Williams Conjecture of symbolic dynamics. This conjecture, which asserted that the notion of matrix shift equivalence was a complete invariant for topological conjugacy, was disproved by Kim-Roush and Wagoner in 1997. Their work leaves open many questions and lines of enquiry. Graph algebras have been studied since the early 1980s and appear in many areas of the field of operator algebras. The theory of Cartan subalgebras of C*-algebras is an area with much potential, as Renault's definition and major results on the subject appeared only two years ago. The topological conjugacy problem is fundamental to the area of symbolic dynamics and has been studied by a large number of experts; any progress on this problem will be a breakthrough, and the investigator's operator-algebraic approach is new. <br/><br/>Both parts of this research project will have broader impacts both within the investigator's institution and in the mathematical community as a whole. The investigator is a member of a mathematics department with a strong commitment to mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. She is actively involved in a number of activities, such as coordinating a math subject GRE preparation workshop and running a seminar aimed at graduate students. The investigator will supervise an undergraduate and a graduate summer research project on work related to this proposal. Finally, the investigator's publications and lectures at conferences on this research will strengthen the bridge between dynamics and operator algebras and foster communication between the specialists in these fields."

A fundamental problem is to understand the long term behavior of such systems. The origins of this problem go back to one of the oldest questions in dynamics- ""Is the Solar System stable?""-which remains largely unsolved to this day. Instability turns out to be a rather typical regime. A conjecture formulated by V.I. Arnold in 1964 asserts that even simple mechanical systems, modeled as integrable Hamiltonian systems, start to exhibit chaotic and unstable behaviors when they become subjected to small, external perturbations. Despite recent progress in the understanding of this problem, a comprehensive chart of the routes yielding instability and chaos is far from completion. Most current approaches apply only to perturbations of special types, and of very small sizes. This limitation makes it difficult to analyze realistic models. The objective of this project is to develop new methods to analyze the effects of realistic perturbations on integrable Hamiltonian systems. The proposed research considers general types of perturbations, which are not necessarily of an extremely small size, and aims to formulate rigorous results that can be applied to concrete models. Particularly, the conditions considered on these systems are explicit and verifiable, rather than of generic type. The approach intends to expand and innovate techniques from differential, algebraic, low dimensional, and symplectic topology. This machinery will be used in tandem with methods based on normal hyperbolicity, perturbation theory, KAM and Aubry-Mather theories, pseudo-holomorphic curves, and random dynamics.<br/><br/>A significant strength of the proposed approach is its applicability to practical situations. This research yields recipes to increase the energy of physical systems with small forcing, with potential applications to particle accelerators, plasma confinement devices, chemical reactions, astrodynamics, and dynamical astronomy. The results from the proposed investigation on instability in the three-body problem can be applied to design fuel efficient trajectories for spacecrafts to explore the Solar System, or to change the orbits of satellites in specific fashions. As an example, one of the methods discussed in this research has been used to design the trajectory of the current NASA's GRAIL mission to the Moon, which begun on January 1st, 2012. The study of random perturbations of deterministic systems proposed in this project plays a key role in modeling of climate change. In addition, this project will pro-actively engage students, including members of underrepresented groups, in educational and research activities, and will contribute to the professional growth of K-12 educators."

A basic goal is to determine how well this ""continuous"" model theory distinguishes analytic structures, and which properties it captures.  Among the applications is new information about isomorphisms and embeddings between structures and their ultrapowers, as these can be readily reinterpreted using continuous model theory. The project also develops the continuous version of many model theoretic concepts, such as stability, primeness, quantifier elimination, model companions, and existential closedness, both for general logical theorems and new paradigms in functional analysis. Up to this point the emphasis has been on tracial von Neumann algebras, but the approach is expected to be fruitful for C*-algebras, subfactors, algebras equipped with an automorphism, etc. <br/> <br/>The past few years have seen several surprising applications of logical techniques in functional analysis, mostly coming from combinatorial and descriptive set theory. This project aims to import concepts from model theory, the study of the relation between mathematical objects and their logical properties. Given an object, suppose one knows the answer to all the questions that can be formulated in a specific way (first-order syntax) -- how well does one understand the object?  In general one cannot recover the object itself, but this ""logical information"" is relevant to many lines of research, and only recently has an appropriate version of model theory been applied to operator algebras. This project will continue to develop the ties between logic and functional analysis, in particular supporting travel for researchers and training for graduate students. The results should offer insights into active topics with applications to other branches of mathematics, for instance  the Connes Embedding Problem and logical stability."

The goal of the conference is to present a survey of some of the major recent results in the area of mathematical analysis which studies the evolution of physical systems with large or infinite number of degrees of freedom in a variety of settings while emphasizing ideas and techniques which are common to these settings. The subject of this conference is one of the most active in contemporary mathematical physics. The conference will bring together leading world-experts in  such topics as KAM theory for partial differential equations, rearrangement inequalities in functional analysis, Anderson localization, the study of polaron systems and the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of coupled anharmonic oscillators. The conference will provide a venue for the dissemination or recent results and methods in the area and will foster further advances in these important topics. A strong component of this conference is educational and aimed at disseminating recent advances in classical, quantum and statistical mechanics. Emphasis will be placed on encouraging interactions between senior and junior  researchers. Special efforts will be made to invite and support graduate students, postdocs, as well as mathematicians from  underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The study of the evolution of systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom is ubiquitous in modern science. In the situation pertaining to classical mechanics, a typical example is that of the evolution of a fluid where a degree of freedom essentially corresponds to the velocity of the fluid at some point in space. Since there are infinitely many such points one is looking at a complex system with infinitely many degrees of freedom in interaction. These give rise to nonlinear partial differential equations which feature in a huge number of applications such as the models used for weather prediction. In the quantum case, examples of such systems are the polaron systems which describe the motion of particles in an ionic crystal (structures similar to that of ordinary salt). Another example studied under the name of Anderson localization has to do with the motion of a quantum particle in interaction with a random medium. The latter is supposed to model, e.g., the impurities in a semiconductor. Finally, a third regime where systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom are the subject of very active study is that of statistical mechanics, in particular in the non equilibrium situation. An example of mathematical challenge in the area is to understand the conduction of heat or electricity, not in an ad hoc phenomenological description, but rather through a derivation from first principles: the basic laws of classical or quantum mechanics at the microscopic level."

Shen and his collaborators will focus on several challenging problems in the area. Resolution of these problems will provide better understanding of some fundamental issues in homogenization, including uniform sharp regularity estimates and rates of convergence of solutions of boundary value problems, asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues and uniform estimates of eigenfunctions, boundary layer phenomenon, and uniform controllability and stabilization for distributed systems. Elliptic equations with periodic coefficients are considered as a model case in homogenization. New techniques and approaches developed for this case will be useful in studying homogenization in other important settings, such as non-uniformly oscillating coefficients, almost periodic coefficients, perforated domains, and evolution operators with highly oscillating coefficients. The proposed research lies at the interface of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Existing and new techniques from harmonic analysis are expected to play a significant role in the development. <br/><br/>Partial differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients are used to describe various processes in materials with rapidly oscillating microstructures, such as composite and perforated materials. The theory of homogenization shows that such materials may be approximately described via a homogenized or effective homogeneous material. As such the theory of homogenization of partial differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients has many important applications in physics, mechanics, and modern technology. The proposed research will develop new methods and techniques that will provide theoretical foundation and guidance for numerical simulations in strongly inhomogeneous materials. The findings from the research will be disseminated in the scientific community by Shen and his collaborators through lectures in conferences, workshops, and graduate courses as well as publishing in mathematical journals and websites. Shen is committed to the training of future generations of mathematicians; graduate students and junior researchers will be involved on the project."

A non-smooth domain refers to a domain with either isolated singularities or a Lipschitz domain. While elliptic boundary value problems for the Laplacian have been well understood for over twenty years, the theory for second order elliptic systems and higher order elliptic equations is incomplete. Another generalization of the classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems that is not yet fully understood is the mixed boundary value problem. This project addresses open problems that are categorized by the following research themes:  boundary value problems for higher order elliptic operators; the spectral radius conjecture on Besov spaces; well-posedness of the mixed problem in Lipschitz domains. <br/><br/> <br/>This mathematics research project is motivated by problems that naturally arise in mathematical physics and engineering. In this regard, the non-smooth setting in which the problems are posed is fundamental since most realistic physical models involve irregular domains. For example, boundary value problems for higher order elliptic operators have applications to engineering in the context of modeling shallow shells, beam bending, and clamped plates. Mixed boundary value problems model the behavior of several physical quantities such as the temperature in a metallurgical melting process, the thermo-elastic potential of an elastic solid punched or stamped by a heated object, or the seepage through a porous material. This mathematics research project will contribute to the aforementioned disciplines as well as produce new mathematical techniques.  While pursuing the research directions outlined above, Ott will initiate activities aimed at increasing the participation of women and other under-represented groups in mathematics. These activities will include outreach activities with local middle and high schools, and research and networking opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students."

Part one concerns Aleksandrov-Clark Theory, which relates rank one perturbations to functional models, the Hilbert transform, holomorphic composition operators, rigid functions and the Nehari interpolation problem. A formula (a generalization of the normalized Cauchy transform) for the adjoint of the Clark operator has recently been proven by the principal investigator in collaboration with Salem Prize winner S. Treil. It should be possible to gain some control over the embedded singular spectrum for rank one perturbations, a long standing problem in the field. Part two pertains to the interpretation of a wide class of singular integral operators, including those of Calderon-Zygmund type, in the two-weight situation with very general measures (in particular, non-doubling). Singular integral operators play an essential role in modern Analysis. The last two parts are devoted to aspects of cyclicity. Cyclicity is related to the question for which measures the corresponding Hardy space is dense in that of square integrable functions with respect to the measure, to the backward shift operator, and a classical result of Douglas, Shapiro and Shields connects cyclicity with pseudocontinuation; and thus opening a new area of complex function theory. In part three, the goal is to prove that (assuming cyclicity of the operator) any non-zero vector yields cyclic vectors for rank one perturbations for almost all parameters. This may be useful in practice. It should be mentioned, that for a cyclic operator, it may not be easy to find a cyclic vector. Two interesting new notions are introduced for the setting of an operator on a separable Hilbert space: Subcyclic vectors (a refinement of the definition of cyclic vectors) and a certain graph. Apart from studying their properties, a deep relationship between them in the context of Anderson-type Hamiltonians has preliminarily been proven by the principal investigator in collaboration with E. Abakumov and A. Poltoratski. The last part of this project is connected to the famous problem of Anderson localization, which was suggested by Nobel laureate P. W. Anderson in 1958. The PI will study the cyclicity of vectors for Anderson-type Hamiltonians (a generalization of most Anderson models, e.g. random Schroedinger operators) via analytical as well as numerical methods.<br/><br/>The underlying goal is to develop the mathematical tools necessary to understand the dynamics of physical systems. Such systems are often described by second-order differential equations, like the Schroedinger equation from quantum mechanics (the governing mechanics at the molecular level) and the string equation which is the cutting edge attempt to unite quantum mechanics with general relativity (the theory describing gravity). One of the objects of study - 'singular integral operators' - have become a useful tool in perturbation theory. The latter is concerned roughly with the following question: Given certain information about a physical system, can one predict what happens in the case where one parameter, for example in the initial condition, is changed/perturbed? Cyclicity, for physicists, means that the spectrum (e.g. of light) is simple or non-degenerate. In many problems it is important to know whether this is the case or not. For example, the above-mentioned Anderson localization addresses the question whether or not an impure crystal allows the diffusion of waves or, roughly speaking, whether all electrons stay within a bounded region in space. The results obtained in the scope of this project will be published in scientific journals and reported at research conferences. The proposed subjects provide a wealth of accessible research questions for undergraduate and graduate students. The principal investigator will write expository articles, give seminars at the student level, and mentor young researchers interested in the many open problems she will make available."

One focus of study is curved spaces where the Riemannian metric is of low regularity.  For metrics which are not twice-differentiable the geodesic flow  is not well-posed, and hence does not determine the flow of energy for waves on such spaces. We consider Lipschitz metrics  (i.e. one bounded derivative), and show that one can nevertheless control the rate of dispersion of energy in a manner consistent with the uncertainty of the geodesic flow. We apply combinatorial arguments to obtain  best possible bounds in Lebesgue spaces for eigenfunctions.  Manifolds with boundary, where energy reflection off the boundary is specified by  Dirichlet or Neumann conditions, are also studied. Here, diffraction effects and multiply reflected geodesics lead to violation of the standard rate of energy dispersion. We adapt tools developed for  Lipschitz metrics, and combine them with reflection techniques to  obtain optimal  bounds, as well as new dispersive  estimates for both wave and Schrodinger equations on manifolds with  boundary. Application of these estimates include new well-posedness  results for nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations.  A key method for all of our work is the decomposition of waves into appropriately scaled wave packets. We combine this decomposition with paradifferential techniques to obtain quantitative bounds on solutions in these settings, where the more precise asymptotic formulas of geometric optics do not hold.<br/><br/><br/>The study of vibrational modes and wave propagation finds applications in the equations of physics, in signal analysis, and in the seismic imaging methods used for geophysical exploration. This mathematics research project aims to establish quantitative bounds that are both of theoretical interest, for the behavior of high-frequency vibrations, and of practical interest, in particular for seismic imaging and for better understanding  the nature of the errors that are introduced by computational approximations. One setting we study is that of rough media, characterized by the sound speed changing in a non-smooth manner, which is a model for the intricate mix of materials occurring within the earth. We also study the manner in which waves reflect off hard objects, including shapes which involve complex multiple reflections. In both of these settings, precise  wavefront analysis methods do not exist.  Instead, our work relies on decomposing signals into coherent  wave-packets, and determining (to a suitable order of approximation) the evolution of these packets as they propagate through the media. The packets developed in our work have also found applications in medical imaging, including reducing the amount of scans needed to sense features of interest."

Semiclassical analysis studies the transition between quantum and classical mechanics. A unifying idea in this area is to study the behavior of quantum mechanical objects such as eigenvalues (energy levels) and eigenfunctions (quantum states) in terms of classical objects like the geodesic flow. The Principal Investigator studies Kac's well-known inverse spectral problem for analytic domains by introducing new tools. In particular, the project will investigate explicit formulas for the complicated wave invariants in order to improve existing results on this subject. The Principal Investigator will also pursue applications of semiclassical analysis to another celebrated problem, Calderon's inverse problem with partial data.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator works in the field of partial differential equations. His project focuses on two very important inverse problems in mathematics and physics, namely, Kac's inverse problem and Calderon's inverse problem. Kac's inverse problem asks roughly whether one can determine the shapes of objects (such as stars) from the wave frequencies that they emit. The Principal Investigator approaches this problem by developing new computational tools that lead to an improved understanding of the relationship between the waves and the shapes of the objects. Such inverse spectral problems, as some engineers have recently suggested, may also have interesting applications in shape-matching, copyright, and medical imaging analysis. The Calderon inverse problem (or, in its technical formulation, the problem of electric impedance tomography) asks whether one can determine the conductivity of a body on the basis of current and voltage measurements taken at its surface. This inverse method has been proposed as a valuable diagnostic tool in medicine for the early detection of breast cancer. The past ten years have seen considerable developments in this area, but the problem with partial data (meaning for measurements taken only on pieces of the surface) remains an open problem. The project investigates the partial data problem with the aid of new analytical techniques."

Roughly speaking, turbulent flame speed is the averaged flame propagation speed under the effect of the flow (turbulence).  The central goal of the project is to understand the dependence of the turbulent flame speed on the turbulence intensity.  A particularly important problem is to figure out how the flow-stretching effect contributes to the strong bending and quenching of flame speeds. Another goal of the project is to compare turbulent flame speeds predicted by various G-equations and other models in the mathematics literature, such as the Majda-Souganidis model and the well-studied scalar reaction-diffusion-advection equation model. Some proposed problems have significant connections with the Aubry-Mather theory and weak KAM theory, which are important for understanding nonintegrable dynamical systems.  So far there are very few rigorous analytical results on turbulent flame speeds in flows of more than two dimensions. A long-term goal of this project is to understand how chaotic structures in three-dimensional flows (e.g., the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow) affect turbulent flame speeds. <br/><br/>Turbulent combustion plays the main role in important industrial issues such as energy production and engine design. The so-called G-equation and its variants are popular models in turbulent combustion due to their simplicity, efficiency, and robustness in fitting experiments. All the research components of the project are closely related to one of the most important unsolved problems in turbulent combustion; namely, to predict the turbulent flame speed and, in particular, to understand how it depends on the turbulence intensity (e.g., think of the relation between the spreading velocity of a wild fire and the strength of the wind). A very important part of the project is its educational component. Besides supervision of graduate students, the principal investigator also plans to participate in several well-established educational programs at UC-Irvine, ranging from the K-12 to the undergraduate levels: California MathCounts, a 6-8th grade math competition; the Irvine Area Math Modelers (IAMM), which is a training program that prepares local high school students for the National High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM)); the SURF program, which is an undergraduate summer research program; the  Freshman Seminar Program, which provides introductory lectures on research to undergraduate students at UC-Irvine. The project will generate broad impact on combustion science and engineering, with implications for clean energy, as well as further the education of the next generation of STEM scientists."

Each SLS will consist of five lectures by the principal speaker, ten 45-minute talks by invited speakers chosen by the principal speaker, and several twenty-minute contributed talks by graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. The topic in 2012 will be ""Higher Codimensional Elliptic Boundary Value Problems."" The conference will take place April 12-14, 2012. The principal speaker will be Professor Rafe Mazzeo from Stanford University. Professor Mazzeo will focus on the geometric microlocal method, stemming from the work of Melrose and his school. That encompasses a wide variety of problems, and includes detailed analyses of operators on spaces with conic points and edges, as well as somewhat less detailed results on general stratified spaces.  Beyond these general analytic approaches, talks will look at applying these tools to specific geometric problems, involving both linear and nonlinear operators. The topic in 2013 will be ""Extension and Interpolation."" The conference will take place April 4-6, 2013. The principal speaker will be Professor Charles Fefferman of Princeton University. Professor Fefferman's talks will address the following questions: suppose we are given a function f defined on a finite subset of Euclidean space, consisting of N data points. How can we compute an m-times differentiable function F on all of Euclidean space that agrees (exactly or approximately) with f at the data points, and has the least possible norm for the first m derivatives? How many computer operations does it take? What if we are allowed to discard a few of the data points? Which points should be discarded to achieve the best improvement in the interpolation? The topic in 2014 will be ''Multi-parameter Geometry and Analysis.'' The conference will take place April 10-12, 2014. The principal speaker will be Professor Alexander Nagel of the University of Wisconsin. Many results in complex and harmonic analysis in which one establishes the boundedness of some linear or sub-linear operator can be formulated in terms of geometry and analysis on spaces of 'homogeneous type'. This concept provides a general abstract setting for the concepts underlying classical Calderon-Zygmund theory of maximal functions and singular and fractional integrals.  In an important sense, a theory which uses spaces of homogeneous type as a paradigm is a one-parameter theory.  Professor Nagel's lectures will focus on some preliminary observations and results in complex and harmonic analysis which fall outside this standard one parameter theory.<br/><br/>Mathematics conferences are vital to the development of the field. They provide unique opportunity for scientists from different subfields to meet so as to (a) summarize the most recent progress in these fields, and their interactions, (b) present new directions of research with sufficient detail to formulate and develop a list of open problems, and (c) provide an opportunity to foster new collaborations and exchange ideas toward the solution of important open questions. In the tradition of the Arkansas Spring Lectures Series, these meetings will provide unique opportunities for young researchers and graduate students to interact with prominent experts in their research areas. Public talks by Professor Lorenzo Sadun in 2012, by Professor Arlie Petters in 2013, and by Professor Colin Adams in 2014 will address audiences of the public at large. Other events include an informal lunch discussion where issues related to being women in mathematics are discussed (hosted by Arkansas Women in Statistics and Mathematics) and a reception for Arkansas graduate students and external graduate students to meet and compare their careers."

The requirements for such bounds arise naturally in convex geometry and geometric functional analysis, where random matrices are used to study typical sections of a high-dimensional convex body. Another direction of this research is the geometry of non-symmetric convex bodies, where the probabilistic methods also play a crucial role.<br/><br/><br/>Several components of this mathematics research project are motivated by problems in computer science and engineering. These include signal reconstruction problems arising in computer tomography, as well as questions related to protecting privacy while releasing statistical information. Rudelson and his collaborators will establish new connections between probability and geometric functional analysis with the objective to study the spectral properties of random matrices.  Random matrices have become the main model for signal reconstruction in wireless communication and can lead to a better understanding of the convergence of many computer science algorithms."

""Analysis"" is mathematics based on calculus (i.e. differentiation and integration), which developed from the pioneering work of Newton and Leibniz. ""Topology"" is the most basic form of geometry and was founded by such eminent nineteenth century and twentieth century mathematicians as Riemann, Poincare and Lefschetz. Riemann and his co-worker Roch stated and proved one of the true gems of nineteenth century mathematics: the Riemann-Roch theorem. This remarkable theorem asserts that certain numbers assigned by an analytical method to a mathematical structure known as a ""divisor on a Riemann surface"" are, in fact, topological. The Riemann-Roch theorem gives a topological formula for these numbers. This Riemann-Roch phenomenon (i.e. certain numbers which are analytically defined are in practice determined by a topological formula) has continued with astonishing vigor throughout twentieth century mathematics. Examples are the Lefschetz fixed-point formula (which led to the A. Weil conjectures) and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for elliptic operators.<br/><br/>The mathematics of this project continues this trend. Thirty years ago the investigator and A. Connes conjectured that an analytic invariant (the K-theory of the reduced C*-algebra of a locally compact Hausdorff topological group) is, in fact, topological. The conjecture has drawn wide attention and has been the subject of papers, conferences, lectures, Ph.D. theses, and books. The conjecture is unusual in that it cuts across several different areas of mathematics and reveals connections between problems which previously were thought to be completely unrelated. The main objective of the project is to take the examples (e.g. all reductive p-adic groups) where the conjecture is now known to be true and to develop the implications. This gives a new and different approach to well known problems and issues. Equivalently, the project  uses the new point of view known as non-commutative geometry to study classical problems in geometry-topology and representation theory. The non-commutative geometry point of view has led to some startling conjectures and results. In the representation theory of reductive p-adic groups a totally unexpected geometric structure has been revealed. This greatly simplifies the representation theory and links Baum-Connes to the Langlands program. For the index of geometrically-arising Fredholm operators, the non-commutative geometry point of view leads to the surprising conclusion that formulas like the Atiyah-Singer index formula apply well beyond elliptic operators. Thus ellipticity is not the essential point needed to obtain a topological formula for the index of such operators."

In this project the principal investigator will focus on dynamics displaying some sort of hyperbolicity. The project will develop in two main directions, dynamical systems with multidimensional time (i.e. actions of higher rank groups) and positive entropy and classical dynamical systems (i.e. one dimensional time) displaying some uniform (though possibly partial) hyperbolicity. The aim is to develop techniques to understand the interactions between measure theoretical and topological properties of a system. This interaction happens to go both ways. For instance, in the direction of topology to measure theory it is observed that on 3-dimensional nilmanifolds partially hyperbolic systems are always K-systems. And in the direction of measure theory to topology it is known that a non-uniformly hyperbolic higher rank action on a 3-dimensional irreducible manifold can only exist on the torus. <br/><br/><br/>Boltzmann's study of gas particles produced the nowadays accepted idea that several systems display some chaotic behavior. While the system may be of very diverse origin, e.g. from mechanical, biological, stock-market, etc., their abstract mathematical model can hopefully be classified and then studied with various mathematical technologies. The aim of this project is to classify systems displaying some hyperbolic behavior, the hallmark of chaotic dynamics, and prove that such systems should have some algebraic origin, thus introducing a purely mathematical and very powerful technology into the study of an otherwise intricate problem. While chaotic behavior is by definition impossible to be deterministically predicted, algebraic systems present symmetries that allows the researcher to study the long run behavior, and be able to describe the orbit structure of such systems. The PI plans to continue with the formation of graduate students, the writing of preparatory material on the subject (e.g. books, survey papers, lecture notes, etc.) and collaborate with the teaching of mini-courses, organization of workshop, seminars, etc."

The investigator hopes to explore these analogies with the ultimate goal of classifying simple C*-algebras of so-called finite nuclear dimension.  In another direction, the investigator will continue working on C*-algebras associated to groups and related spaces that were recently introduced in joint work with Erik Guentner. Finally, we will continue our study of dynamical systems associated to II_1 factors which arise from certain homomorphisms.<br/><br/>One very successful idea in mathematics is that we can learn about complicated objects by approximating with simpler objects, then passing to a limit. For example, in calculus we compute the area under a curve using rectangular approximations, then refining the approximations over and over. Operator algebras are (usually) infinite dimensional objects which provide the natural framework for quantum mechanics, for example. Moreover, deep and unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology and probability were discovered over the years. As such, a solid understanding of the structure of operator algebras is important. The general philosophy of using approximations by simpler objects becomes especially relevant here since the objects of interest are infinite dimensional. The investigator will continue an established tradition of trying to use finite dimensional approximations to better understand some fundamental infinite dimensional objects."

The principal investigator will apply and develop methods of noncommutative geometry to study the index theory of hypoelliptic Fredholm operators associated to various geometric structures (most notably contact structures and foliations). His belief is that the results will pay off in two directions: hypoelliptic operators provide examples of phenomena not exhibited by elliptic operators, yielding new insights that further the development of index theory itself, and, conversely, index formulas of hypoelliptic operators will lead to new results in geometry. A specific aim of the project is to develop new applications of index theory to contact geometry.<br/><br/>In the early 1960s the British mathematician Michael Atiyah and the American mathematician Isodore Singer derived an important formula. The ""Atiyah-Singer index formula"" established a deep connection between two central branches of mathematics: analysis (the modern version of differential and integral calculus) and topology/geometry (the study of higher dimensional curved space). The index formula subsumed several important classical results and has subsequently led to numerous applications and new developments in many areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical physics. The continued relevance of index theory is evidenced, for example, by the very recent proof of the celebrated ""Weinstein conjecture,"" which says that (under certain mild hypotheses) every mechanical arrangement of moving objects (a ""dynamical system"") can be configured in such a way that the collective motion of the system will exactly repeat itself after a finite time-interval. The proof of this theorem makes use, in crucial places, of the formula of Atiyah and Singer. This project extends the applicability of index formulas to a large new class of problems that were not covered by the original theory. Ideas from the emerging area of noncommutative geometry (a recent and radical revision of the foundation concepts of geometry inspired by quantum theory) play a central role in this work. This project establishes substantial new connections between separate branches of pure mathematics, and it opens up a new area of application of the index formula that has been crucial to the development of mathematics for the last fifty years."

The goal of the first direction is to understand whether or not one can approximately cloak an object using the transformation optics (or the change of variable scheme) under various circumstances. Regarding the second direction, the principal investigator seeks to obtain general impedance boundary conditions for highly conductive obstacles. This part of the project is intended to pose new problems and answer new questions motivated by image processing and recent approaches to Sobolev spaces. As to the third theme, the project investigates patterns formed by deformations of thin elastic membranes. The following three problems are considered: (1) the deformation of a thin circular elastic sheet placed on top of an open cylinder and subject to a downward force at the center of the sheet, (2) the deformation of a floating thin elastic membrane, and (3) the deformation of a thin film bonded to a compliant substrate.<br/><br/>The understanding of the problems whose solutions this project hopes to find will advance many applications in technology (e.g., cloaking, image processing, determining the property of materials).

A typical example is the temperature considered as a function of a point varying on the surface of the earth. By contrast, the theory of maps with values into spheres has not yet been sufficiently developed.  A typical example of such a map is the orientation of a compass needle as a function of a point varying on the surface of the earth. The orientation varies regularly except at the North Pole and the South Pole. Such points are called the singularities of the map.  The reason why mathematicians work with Sobolev maps (rather than smooth maps) is precisely to allow maps with singularities.  The simplest example consists of maps with values into the unit circle (a.k.a. unimodular maps). They occur naturally in many physical phenomena (e.g., liquid crystals, superconductors).  It turns out these classes of maps have an amazingly rich structure from the point of view of analysis, geometry, and topology.  This is one topic to be investigated in this project. The position of a point on the unit circle is determined by an angle (called the lifting of the original map). Any unimodular map admits plenty of liftings (since the angle is measured modulo two-pi). The project will study ""optimal"" liftings in the sense that they have least total variation. A lifting is usually discontinuous (even if the original map is smooth): every traveler crossing the International Date Line is aware of this discontinuity!  The principal investigator proposes to classify all optimal liftings of a given unimodular map using only the geometry of its singular set.  More precisely, he and his collaborators conjecture that there is a one-to-one correspondence between optimal liftings and minimal surfaces spanned by the singularities. They have been able to establish the conjecture in many two-dimensional cases.  For example, if the map has precisely two singularities located at the North and South Poles, optimal liftings are classified by the meridians. Another important topic is the uniqueness of liftings.  The problem reduces to the following question: Given a function taking only the values 0 and 1, what additional assumptions imply that the function is constant?  The standard condition is that the function be continuous (but this excludes many important physical problems). The principal investigator has been able to derive the same conclusion for a much wider class of functions, but a general condition is still missing. A key ingredient is a new formula that provides a way of approximating total variation by nonlocal functionals involving no derivatives.  <br/><br/>The principal investigator has recently learned that some of the tools that will be either improved or developed from scratch in the process of carrying out this project could be useful in image processing. The need for efficient image restoration methods has grown with the massive production of digital images often taken, or transmitted, in poor conditions (e.g., by UAVs).  Likewise, to achieve the best possible diagnosis it is important that medical images be sharp, clear, and free of noise. The analysis of fine structures (e.g., micro-calcifications detected in mammograms) is one of the major challenges faced in medical image processing. Blurred and distorted images need to be restored and enhanced before one can extract reliable information. Over the past twenty years sophisticated mathematical techniques have been used in this field. The principal investigator has established contacts with leading experts who surmise that his and his collaborators' discoveries may lead to more efficient algorithms used effectively in concrete situations."

Topic (a) is only loosely connected with topics (b) and (c); but a unifying theme in the study of all topics has been the use of the theory of positive operators and of generalizations of the Krein-Rutman theorem. For example, to an iterated function system as in (a), one associates a family of positive linear operators parametrized by positive real real numbers; and one proves that each such positive linear operator has a strictly positive eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue equal to the operator's spectral radius. The desired Hausdorff dimension is the unique value of the parameter for which the spectral radius of the operator equals one, and finding the Hausdorff dimension is facilitated by knowledge about the regularity of the eigenvectors.  In studying topic (c) one finds examples of linear, nonautonomous functional differential equations which naively appear to be real analytic. Nevertheless, such equations may have infinitely differentiable periodic solutions which fail to be real analytic at an uncountable set of points.  The theory of positive operators is helpful in constructing such examples.<br/><br/>Many real-world problems are best modeled by equations which take history into account, so-called ""functional differential equations"" (FDE's) or ""differential-delay equations.""  Thus red blood cell production in the human body at a given time involves knowledge of red blood cell levels six to ten days before and has been modeled by FDE's.  Modeling the pupil light reflex in the human eye again involves FDE's. Many other examples can be found, not only in biology and physiology, but also in population dynamics, mechanical engineering (mechanical vibrations), nonlinear optics (lasers with opto-electronic feedback), economics and physics ( the famous and little-understood two body problem of electrodynamics). It is likely that advances in the theoretical understanding of FDE's will eventually have real-world applications.  The search for such theoretical advances is a major focus of this proposal."

Such estimates and  inequalities provide an effective means to derive properties of solutions of evolution equations and likewise, evolution equations can be used to derive variational inequalities. Exploiting this interplay has been very fruitful in the past work of the investigator, who plans to approach various problems in this framework. One is to prove new sharp non-local version of the  Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities that arise in connection with the fast diffusion equation and porous medium equation. Such equations arise in the modeling of many phenomena, physical to biological, and the analytic problems to be investigated are chosen for their potential broader impact as well their intrinsic analytic interest. Another such problem concerns quantitiative stability for the  Brun-Minkowski  inequality and its application in the study of phase transitions.   A similar philosophy applies as well to certain  problems in kinetic theory, where the plan is to derive quantitative estimates on speed of approach to  equilibrium for some inhomogeneous master equations of Kac type that have recently been used to model not only physical phenomena, but also phenomena in population biology.<br/><br/>Many phenomena in science and technology can be modeled by evolution equations. One example that is the object of research  in this proposal is the Keller Segel system, which models the aggregation, or the absence thereof, in the motion of bacteria. Understanding the behavior of solutions of these equations is both biologically and mathematically interesting.  In  particular,  it is often observed that systems of many interacting  agents (such as bacteria) or particles, either classical or quantum mechanical, evolve toward an equilibrium, and they do this at a certain speed.  Determining the the speed of this process is vital to the understanding  of many such models. This proposal concerns research on obtaining themathematical keys to such problems and their application in a broad range of fields. A central focus is solving certain maximization problems, and proving theorems asserting that any input that produces nearly maximal output must be close, in a an appropriate sense, to input that gives the exact maximum. As recent research of the investigator has shown, such theorems provide an effective means to unlock the information in models of the type described above, and the research  proposed here will further this progress."

These class of equations play now a critical role in describing optical devices, Bose-Einstein condensate fluids and other nonlinear dispersive problems in fluid dynamics and plasma physics. The equations being nonlinear, require new techniques to understand the large time behavior of the solutions of this class of equations. Using the hydrodynamic formulation of Schroedinger equation it was possible to analyze in detail a completely new type of situations, in which a soliton solution is created through tunneling from a potential well. The analysis of the two dimensional case, with vorex initial condition, revealed a new phenomena, the formation and the ejection of waves in a form of jets. The theory we use, predict the direction and structure the of the jets. The prediction and the details of this soliton formation will be further studied. In particular, the method offers a new way of proving a-priori estimates on the solutions of nonlinear Schrodinger equation which are not of the standard energy estimates. A second part of the research involves the detailed decay in time of solutions of the wave equation on Schwarzschild and Kerr manifolds. In particular the decay rates as a function of the angular momentum of the initial data is pursued. This will provide a rigorous proof of a classical conjecture of Price in the theory of General Relativity.<br/><br/>New processes involving optical devices are studied in detail. In particular one considers a situation in which light energy is located in a potential well, inside a properly active dielectric material. Then, the development of the localized energy is derived by a new mathematical formalism adapted to this situation. It is shown that soliton waves can emerge from the well, and the theory is capable of determining their size and speed. As such, it allows, by tuning the shape of the potential well and the incoming energy to produce solitons with desired profile, sometimes referred to as soliton guns. This approach has already been observed in some experiments based on previous works by the PI. the recent preditin of jet formation through tunneling two dimensional systems, is being developed; in particular, experimental observation and validation is planned. A second part of the research is the mathematical analysis of wave propagation and decay on manifolds generated by black holes. The approach to this problem led a to a new, more general theory of solving integral equations of the Voltera type, and also led to a rigorous mathematical verification of some classical conjectures in the physics literature concerning the behavior of radiated waves off a black hole."

The problems are formulated in the language of the theory of fully nonlinear PDE, and the project includes investigation of numerical methods for finding their solutions.<br/><br/>Fully nonlinear partial differential equations arise in a multitude of contexts, including control theory, optimal mass transportation problems, and geometry, to name just three. Rigidity and other characteristics of all kinds of hulls (of, say, ships or missiles) are described in terms of such equations. Control problems and fully nonlinear equations also turn up in engineering, target tracking, pattern recognition, and a host of other applied areas. There are many random processes that it is both desirable and important to control (e.g., the performance of a stock portfolio, the trajectory of a missile). In target tracking, for instance, it is important to emphasize that the trajectory of a projectile is observed, in general, with certain errors or noises. Therefore, the first problem in controlling the trajectory is to filter the noise out of the observations. Such problems were initially solved by Kalman and Bucy, who constructed and used their filter during the Apollo program. Needless to say, much more work needs to be done in order to achieve more accurate results. Improved filters would be relevant to endeavors such as weather forecasting (or, more generally, climate change forecasting), which is one of the possible concrete applications of stochastic partial differential equations and the theory of filtering and prediction of random processes."

The major goal of the project is the development of new techniques to achieve breakthroughs in our understanding of fluid dynamics phenomena. The project research will address fundamental properties of the classical equations of fluid dynamics, qualitative properties of solutions, and modeling applications. The project focuses on three main directions. The first set of problems concerns global regularity vs finite time blow up that will be investigated for a range of fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. Axi-symmetric solutions for 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes will be considered, new potentially singular scenarios will be studied and new regularity criteria will be sought. Active scalars, such as surface quasi-geostrophic equation coming from atmospheric science, will also be analyzed -- here the effort will concentrate on studying properties of solutions, search for new Lyapunov functionals and novel regularity estimates. In the second direction, we will seek more detailed information on long time dynamics. This will include research on some long-open conjectures for 2D Euler equation, including possible mechanisms of inverse energy cascade, mixing and small scales formation. We will also work on passive scalar models and mixing properties of flows in this context. Biomixing by chemotaxis will be investigated as well, with an eye towards applications in ecology and marine biology. The third direction focuses on complex fluid models. In many applications - for instance, in studies of particle suspensions or solutions - the microscopic structure of   particles in the fluid becomes important. The shape and interactions between the particles can be taken into account by adding kinetic equations to the fluid dynamics systems and introducing physically natural couplings. Analysis of solutions to such systems, their regularity and qualitative properties will be a part of the project work.<br/><br/>Fluids are ubiquitous in nature, science and engineering. Diverse phenomena involving fluids appear in atmospheric and ocean science, astrophysics, chemistry and biology, and are described by partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. These equations are some of  <br/>the most difficult partial differential equations to analyze. They   describe a wide range of complex phenomena, are nonlinear, and usually   nonlocal. Due to their complexity, even the classical equations such   as 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes are far from well understood. The   proposed research lies at the interface of several central areas of mathematics - partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis and Fourier analysis. This FRG project   brings together several researchers that have been at the forefront of recent developments in mathematical fluid mechanics. Different   participants bring different strengths to the project. It is expected that intensive collaboration within FRG framework will lead to   development of new ideas and approaches and result in a burst of activity in mathematics of fluids. New techniques and tools developed   are likely to have an impact in neighboring areas of mathematics,  biology, and atmospheric science. An important part of the FRG   activity will be training of junior researchers.  Mathematics of fluid  mechanics covers a broad range of effective techniques, which are   applicable beyond fluids. The training activities will include a   summer school, two workshops, group meetings, course development,   research seminars and research projects for advanced undergraduate   students. The principal investigators will advertise all training   activities broadly, and strive to recruit talented, motivated, and   diverse trainees.

Building on recent developments, the principal investigator will study symmetry properties and the nodal structure of nonnegative solutions of elliptic PDE. The main goals are to classify spatial domains on which solutions with nontrivial nodal sets can exist and to determine whether such solutions can exist at all for spatially homogeneous equations. In parabolic equations, a tendency of positive solutions to ""improve their symmetry"" as time increases to infinity is a remarkable example of how parabolic flows can reduce spatial complexity. The principal investigator will continue his study of this interesting asymptotic symmetry phenomenon, while bearing in mind applications of asymptotic symmetry theorems in convergence results for parabolic equations. Other methods will also be employed to address several long-standing problems concerning the convergence of solutions of parabolic PDE to equilibria. Another topic in this project concerns positive solutions of elliptic PDE on the whole Euclidean space that decay to zero in some variables but do not decay in other variables. The symmetry of the solutions with respect to the decay variables and their behavior with respect to the remaining variables will be examined. The principal investigator will also continue his research concerning Liouville-type theorems on the nonexistence of nontrivial solutions for specific classes of nonlinear equations. Scaling techniques based on Liouville theorems have a wide range of applications in the theory of parabolic PDE, which will be further explored in the project. Results of the above projects will be applied in studies of threshold solutions in various parabolic problems. Such solutions occur as separatrices between solutions exhibiting two different kinds of behavior, such as the decay to zero and blow-up in finite time. They have been studied for purely theoretical reasons as well as in connection with quenching and propagation phenomena in applied sciences.<br/><br/>In less technical terms, the project can be characterized as qualitative or geometric analysis of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. Such equations are widely used in models in the applied sciences, in particular, chemical engineering, combustion theory, and ecology. Understanding qualitative properties of solutions is important for the internal development of the mathematical theory of partial differential equations as well as for the improvement of their modeling relevance. For the interpretation of models involving nonlinear partial differential equations, rigorous analysis maintains its indispensable role even in presence of the high computing power currently available for numerical analysis. Not only does it provide guidelines for and simplifications of otherwise formidable computations, but in many situations qualitative analysis is the only way to deal with difficult problems concerning general solutions of nonlinear equations. The present project addresses questions that concern geometric properties of solutions (such as their symmetries when viewed as functions of spatial variables) as well as their behavior with respect to time (periodicity properties, stabilization to equilibria, so-called blow-up in finite time). Development of new mathematical techniques for addressing such questions is an integral part of the project."

The conference is motivated by the development in recent years of new powerful tools for overcoming the challenges associated with problems set in high dimensional spaces. These tools include compressive sensing, random projections, diffusion maps for parameterizing high-dimensional data sets, fast multipole methods, and many more. The premise of the meeting is that these different techniques share an intellectual heritage in a body of work originating from harmonic and functional analysis.  A major problem confronting scientists nowadays is  dealing with massive quantities of data.  Over the last decades, the development of powerful computers has been very useful in treating many computational problems. Nonetheless severe limitations occur when the amount of data becomes too large.   The interaction of Harmonic Analysis, Computational Mathematics, Combinatorial Geometry, Probability and Operator Theory has initiated a host of powerful methods to deal both with the processing and organizing of massive data sets, as well as efficient Numerical Analysis.  More importantly they reveal new mathematical structures and open fundamental questions which need to be addressed, questions related to the analysis of functions in high dimensions, their sampling, effective descriptions, and approximations for efficient computability.  Any further progress will have an enormous impact on our digital data driven world.  <br/><br/>The program for the conference features:   (1) Lectures by leaders in the field. The conference will feature about 15 lectures by distinguished researchers . (2) Panel discussion on future directions. The conference will feature a panel discussion with some of the principal investigators from the major federal research agencies and national laboratories (ONR, DARPA, AFOSR, ARO, Livermore National Lab, Pacific Northwest Lab, Oak Ridge Laboratory) joined by Ronald R. Coifman, Peter W. Jones, Vladimir Rokhlin whose research influenced and laid much of the mathematical foundations of the field. The purpose is to identify fields of research that are likely to be both in demand by applications, and intellectually ripe for substantial progress.  (3) Poster sessions. Younger researchers will be invited to present posters during the meeting with prime slots in the schedule reserved for poster sessions, and for a `poster blitz' presentation.   A major goal of this conference is to educate the younger generation about critical needs in the analysis of data, important open problems and underlying areas of mathematical research.  The scientific techniques under discussion are likely to have a profound impact on important applications. In particular help overcome key challenges in computing today and in the future (the ""deluge of data"" problem and the communication speed bottleneck).

The first concerns the study of some partial differential equations that arise in the modeling of the motion of liquid droplets on a solid support (e.g., a water drop sliding down an inclined plane). This part of the research focuses on two particular equations: the thin film equation and the quasi-static approximation. The main feature of both of these models is the presence of a moving contact line (the boundary of the contact region between the drop and the solid support) whose motion is not known a priori. These models are thus examples of ""free boundary problems,"" whose mathematical analysis is very challenging. The research focuses on the questions of existence of solutions, their regularity, and their long-time behavior (especially their convergence to traveling-wave-type solutions). The second direction of research concerns certain nonlocal, third-order parabolic equations that arise, in particular, in the modeling of hydraulic fractures. These equations are reminiscent of the thin film equation, but involve nonlocal singular integral operators (such as the half-Laplacian). The project aims at developing a full existence and regularity theory for such equations. Though parts of the theory developed over the years for the thin film equation seem to adapt readily to this equation, there are important differences due to the nonlocal character of the operator. As a consequence, the existence of solutions is not presently known in many physically important cases. The last direction of research concerns the study of anomalous diffusion phenomena. This is part of a broad program initiated by the principal investigator to study anomalous diffusion regimes arising as limits of kinetic-type models. He intends to push this program to study anomalous heat conduction in chains of anharmonic oscillators. In such chains, heat is transported by vibrations that can be modeled as a gas of phonons, whose evolution is modeled by the Boltzmann phonon equation. By studying asymptotic regimes for this equation, the principal investigator seeks to derive a nonlinear anomalous Fourier law for heat conduction.<br/><br/>Accurately modeling the motion of liquid droplets is an important problem in fluid mechanics with many applications in engineering. The physical phenomena are extremely complex (the motion of the fluid inside the droplet and its behavior at the edge of the droplet both involve very complicated equations), and many simplified models have been proposed. This project focuses on the mathematical analysis of some of those models with the aim of better understanding their fundamental properties. Ultimately, the goal is to compare these properties with experiments to validate (or invalidate) the various models. Another aspect of the project involves equations that arise in the modeling of hydraulic fracture. (Hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" consists in propagating rock fractures by the injection of fluids with very high pressure. It is involved, for instance, in the extraction of shale gas.) The project addresses some fundamental questions concerning these equations, such as the existence and regularity of solutions. This is important, since without a proper mathematical theory it is very difficult to develop accurate and trustworthy numerical methods. The project will thus lead to a better understanding of the properties of these widely used models and provide a framework for developing accurate computer-based numerical simulations. Finally, this research program includes the training and mentoring of students. Indeed, this proposal offers many opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students to work on accessible research projects with physically relevant applications."

Systems with sub-exponential, polynomial divergence of nearby orbits are often called parabolic. Parabolic dynamical systems arise in many mathematical models of scientific phenomena and in applications of dynamical systems to other branches of mathematics, in particular to number theory and geometry. The main long term goal of the research is to explore how far the ideas and methods developed in the study of the above-mentioned systems, based on renormalization and harmonic analysis, can be generalized towards a theory of parabolic dynamics. In the near future, Forni plans to organize his research around three main themes: ergodic theory on finite-area translation surfaces, compact and non-compact, and of billiards in polygons; ergodic theory of smooth time-changes of nilflows and horocycle flows; renormalization and quantitative equidistribution of (higher-step) nilflows and Weyl sums. Among the questions considered are long-standing open problems such as ergodicity of billiards in polygons, the spectral type of smooth time-changes of horocycle flows and optimal bounds on Weyl sums.<br/><br/><br/>The proponent's research is in the field of dynamical systems, that is, the study of motion of a deterministic system with time. The most classical example is the motion of the planets, but dynamical systems arise in all area of sciences, for instance in physics, biology, economics.  In addition, the methods of dynamical systems can be applied to study problems in other fields of mathematics, in particular in geometry and number theory, as it has been done very successfully in recent decades as dynamical systems has moved closer and closer to the core of  pure mathematical research (without abandoning its original strong connection to natural sciences and to applied mathematics). In dynamical systems there is a well-established theory of chaos which applies to systems whose nearby trajectories diverge exponentially fast with time (the weather is perhaps the most famous example.) At the other end of the spectrum, there is regular motion, characterized by trajectories that move all together. The proponent's goal is to advance fundamental research on the intermediate case of weakly chaotic systems, that is, systems that have some measure of chaotic behavior, but  whose nearby trajectories diverge at most polynomially fast with time. The motion of an idealized billiard ball on a polygonal table is an example. Systems of this kind, called parabolic, are especially important in applications to geometry, number theory and to mathematical models coming from several branches of physics: solid-state physics, celestial mechanics, statistical mechanics.  For instance, in recent years in number theory and, to a lesser extent, in geometry many questions have been reformulated (sometimes solved) as questions on the dynamics of certain parabolic flows. In physics, the motion of an electron on the the so-called Fermi surface of an atom (solid-state physics), the motion of planets near a singularity (celestial mechanics), the motion of an atom in a box (statistical mechanics) are related to parabolic systems. This project also has an important training component with the goal of forming researchers with wide mathematical knowledge."

More recently, geometric questions about knots and links have led to numerous advances in modern algebra.  Thus geometric examples offer common ground where specialists in different areas can exchange ideas and techniques.  The Geometry Group at Rice builds on this common ground to train students and postdoctoral fellows in the methods of mathematical research.<br/><br/>"

The conference will center around Nevanlinna theory and complex hyperbolic geometry. Notre Dame has been a power house in these areas. In recent years, there has been much important progress, including several major breakthroughs, in the study of complex hyperbolic geometry and Nevanlinna theory. The purpose of this conference is to gather experts in the field of algebraic or complex geometry, especially complex hyperbolic geometry and Nevanlinna theory, to report and understand the recent exciting discoveries and techniques.<br/><br/>Special efforts will be made to invite young researchers, graduate students and women mathematicians to participate and to give talks during the conference. We expect that this conference will have a positive impact on young researchers and graduate students in the field. The members of the organizing committee are planning to act as editors of a special proceedings volume for the proposed conference. Each submitted paper will be carefully refereed to ensure the submission is appropriate and is of high quality. It is expected that many publishers will be interested in printing such a volume. The conference will provide a platform of communication, to explore further collaboration on the diverse areas related to this subject, to further expound on new ideas and to introduce the rapid developments in this area to a new generation of mathematicians. The geographic diversity of the participants should contribute to the fast dissemination of new scientific developments reported in this conference.

These lines are: 1) 'noncommutative functional analysis and noncommutative Banach function theory', which in part continues the investigators introduction, and application, of powerful tools from classical functional analysis and C*-algebra and von Neumann algebra theory to 'noncommutative functional analysis', 2) the general theory and structure of operator algebras, for example extending to general operator algebras important new notions of equivalence that are attracting widespread attention in the field. The investigator and collaborators are also proposing to investigate applications of the above.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally grew out of quantum mechanics. It is often of crucial importance to see how formulas involving numerical variables behave when these variables are allowed to be operator variables. Because operator variables do not commute, this is often called 'noncommutative mathematics' It is out of such a process that the theory of operator spaces and completely bounded maps emerged.  This theory, which the investigator helped to found, is a novel and compelling approach to problems involving linear analysis which arise in 'noncommutative mathematics'. The investigator's research focuses partly on transferring important ideas and tools from classical subfields of linear analysis, via such 'quantization', to solve significant problems in 'noncommutative' mathematics. Most of the projects involve a deep unification of ideas from several different research areas; and often require extremely deep and technically demanding analysis.  Successful findings would bring several subjects closer together, attract scientists with disparate backgrounds, and lead to cross-fertilization between these disciplines."

The project will pursue this approach and give a prominent role to Toda maps in the study of the absolutely continuous spectrum.<br/><br/>The mathematical questions that will be studied in this project are related to several classical areas of pure mathematics; however, they derive their main motivation from the theory of quantum mechanics.

For example, wave- or dispersive-type equations display this kind of behavior. These evolution equations provide the possibility of constructing solutions from prescribed initial conditions. In some evolution processes, a prescribed restriction (or boundedness) over time is given and the question is then whether the boundedness property persists forever or whether some sort of ""unboundedness"" can arise (e.g., a freak wave suddenly appearing in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics). These evolution processes are fundamental in nature, yet we are still in the infancy of their full analytical description. This project seeks to shed new light on the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE), in particular, of dispersive PDE for which the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with linear evolution. A special emphasis will be placed on the study of singularity formation, such as collapse and blow-up. The principal investigator's research program starts from advancing the theory of collapse for the simplest models in nonlinear wave equations, proceeds by expanding this theory to more generalized models and equations, and then goes on to explore the dynamics of solutions for simple dispersive systems, which have hitherto been studied little but which describe important models in the physical world. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop singularity theory for dispersive systems like the Davey-Stewartson system. These equations arise in physical contexts such as the description of water waves or acoustic waves, and in various fields such as laser optics and fluid and air dynamics.<br/><br/>This project will advance the frontiers in the theory of nonlinear evolution equations, in particular, improving our understanding of collapse phenomena. It will produce a rigorous analytical description of concentration and aggregation for physical applications in real life. This work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen interinstitutional ties, for example, between the George Washington University (GWU) and Howard University. In addition, the project will provide mathematical training and educational experiences at all mentoring levels, reinforcing future US competitiveness. It will focus on attracting, training, and retaining in mathematics and science outstanding female students and students from underrepresented groups. Vertical integration of educational activities, from middle school to the graduate level and beyond, will help to reinforce the project's agenda and contribute to the recruitment and retention of skillful workforce in the STEM fields. These activities will occur at the middle school level through the DC Math Circle program; at the high school level through the GWU summer precollege program (which annually recruits over two hundred students nationally); at the undergraduate level by engaging the principal investigator in the supervision of senior research theses and her serving as a mentor and  guest lecturer at the GWU ""Summer Program for Women in Math"" ; and, finally, at the graduate level by organizing the DC Grad Camp, with the emphasis on attracting female and underrepresented minority students."

Recently, a number of techniques originating in abstract harmonic analysis have been adopted to the setting of non-locally compact Polish groups, thus providing a rich tool set for furthering the understanding of the topological groups arising internally in descriptive set theory and the model theory of countable first-order structures. The PI is engaged is studying various aspect of these tools, both applying the resulting structure theory of Polish groups to problems in functional analysis, as witnessed in his recent collaboration with V. Ferenczi on the existence of optimal norms on Banach spaces, and calibrating properties of countable first-order structures M with topological properties of their automorphism group Aut(M). In addition, the PI is studying the block Ramsey theory originating in the work of W.T. Gowers, which has led to significant results in the geometric theory of Banach spaces, in particular, a classification program for separable Banach spaces based on infinite-dimensional Ramsey theory. As has become clearer recently, the underlying Ramsey theoretical results are best understood in terms of infinite games of perfect information with very strong winning strategies and to which usual determinacy does not immediately apply. <br/><br/><br/>The research described in the proposal is largely inter-disciplinary, connecting a variety of fields from mathematical logic to functional and harmonic analysis. The PI aims to further the continuous integration of descriptive set theory with other branches of mathematics and thus provide new venues for a field traditionally having benefited enormously from deep work in purer areas of set theory. In part through the PI's work, eventually, these results will hopefully trickle down to applications to rather tame problems in analysis, i.e., not a priori involving set theory or logic."

In particular, the principal investigator will concentrate on three projects: (1) the continued study of a discrete version of the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, in particular, its connections with orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle, Lie-Poisson algebras, and its continuum limits; (2) the study of properties (e.g., expected diagonalization times) of certain random matrix ensembles when considered as initial data for integrable flows such as the Toda lattice and the QR-algorithm; and (3) the study, using Riemann-Hilbert methods, of long-time asymptotics for integrable systems, namely, the Toda lattice and the Korteweg-deVries equation, and for certain nonintegrable perturbations of these systems. <br/><br/>The research topics of this project fall in the wide areas of mathematical physics and partial differential equations, with a particular emphasis on questions related to such well-established mathematical areas as completely integrable systems, random matrices, and their applications to certain numerical algorithms. Partial differential equations emerge in a variety of physical contexts as mathematical models for the time-evolution of certain physical quantities. A particular class of such equations are the so-called completely integrable systems, which are characterized by the fact they satisfy a sufficiently large (in a sense which can be made precise) number of conservation laws. The theory of completely integrable systems has a long and distinguished history. Over the past thirty years, in particular, interest in the field has been fueled on the one hand by the fact that many of the equations known to be completely integrable are obtained as models of fluid dynamics, and on the other hand by the close connections that have been discovered with many fields of pure mathematics, such as Lie algebras or symplectic and Poisson geometry. One of the fundamental goals of the current project is to expand and deepen the understanding of these connections and to widen the class of models to which the techniques of completely integrable theory apply. Hence one aims to describe as fully as possible the solutions to these models and hopefully to gain thereby insights into real-life phenomena. An essential part of the proposal is its educational component, which is centered around the organization of an annual summer school for advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s on various topics of current research interest at the juncture of analysis, partial differential equations, and numerical analysis. All talks in the summer school will be delivered on preassigned articles by the participants. Beyond its broad mathematical impact, the project will allow the principal investigator to expand  other educational activities as well. She will support the work of graduate students through advanced courses, seminars, and student research workshops, and she will work with local chapters of the Association for Women In Mathematics (AWM) in the Chicago area to promote the advancement of women in mathematical careers."

The mathematical equations under consideration will mostly be dispersive, and hence conservative, but several non-conservative (or dissipative) extensions will also be studied. By doing so, connections between equations of nonlinear Schrdinger type and complex Ginzburg-Landau type models will become apparent. In the present project the PI will: (1) study the influence of fast rotating potentials, experimentally used to create quantum vortices, on the possibility of finite time blow-up, and establish connections to recently found singular ring type solutions; (2) give a time-dependent description of vortex creation by means of adiabatic perturbation theory; (3) establish rigorous connections between nonlinear Schrdinger equations and other dispersive models; (4) explore the possibility of dispersive blow-up for the considered equations; (5) analyze the long-time behavior of solutions to Schrdinger type equations with additional nonlinear damping terms and other dissipative regularizations. The techniques to be deployed will range from numerical simulations over formal analytical methods to fully rigorous mathematical investigations based on, e.g., virial estimates, multi-scale techniques, Lyapunov-type functionals, and concentration compactness methods.<br/><br/><br/>This project aims to find a rigorous mathematical description of certain collective phenomena in many-body quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is one of the two fundamental building blocks in modern physics and it concerns the study of mechanical systems whose dimensions are close to, or even smaller than, the atomic scale. The mathematical formulation pioneered by E. Schrdinger, P. Dirac, and J. von Neumann is to a large extent based on partial differential equations for complex-valued wave functions, which describe the state of the particles in a probabilistic interpretation. It is the solution of these equations which can be seen as one of the main driving forces in the early stages of the development of the theory. The present project lies at the intersection between the mathematical analysis of such equations and their application in theoretical physics. It will help gain a deeper mathematical understanding of the qualitative behavior of the different classes of nonlinear equations involved and their relations with each other. Answers to the questions raised will have a strong impact as proven statements in a wide range of the mathematical sciences, and can be seen as complimentary to the vast amount of non-rigorous results available in the physics literature. Most of the proposed research will be conducted through national and international collaborations with colleagues working in mathematical analysis, theoretical physics, and numerical simulations."

Among these are results describing the effect of a small random external field on the dynamics of solitons or blow-up solutions, the effect of interaction forces between multiple solitons on their dynamics, the stabilizing influence of a rapidly oscillating nonlinear coefficient on a soliton, and the extent to which a strong confining external field can reduce the effective dimension of the dynamics.

He will continue to refine and extend his methods to address these more sophisticated problems.<br/><br/>The equations studied in this project arise as important physical models. Solitons appear as well-localized stable structures, while blow-up is associated with a sharp focusing of a wave and ultimate break-down of the physical model. For example, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is the wave function for a collection of ultracold atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Since its Nobel-prize-winning realization in the laboratory in 1995, further experiments have produced solitons and finite-time blow-up, and there is now a large body of physics literature motivating many of the problems this project will consider.

Semidefinite programming, based on LMIs, is one of the main developments in optimization over the previous 15 years with applications ranging through most quantitative areas of science. A main thrust of this proposal is: what is the scope of semidefinite programming? Problems treatable with LMIs are convex, but conversely which convex problems are treatable with LMIs? With collaborators the principal investigator is currently making significant advances on the main aspects of this problem. Special emphasis goes to LMI problems motivated by systems engineering. While numerics for LMIs, is hotly pursued there is no systematic theory for simplifying or analyzing matrix inequalities algebraically. Major parts of this proposal are  to develop such a theory. This produces a rich body of elegant problems in functional analysis including those described as follows. A symmetric noncommutative polynomial is called ""free positive"" provided that all of its values when evaluated on matrices is a positive semi-definite matrix. ""Free convexity"" is defined analogously. The set of all matrices solving a noncommutative polynomial inequality is called a ""free semialgebraic set."" Linear Matrix Inequalities concern conditions making  a given linear pencil take positive semidefinite values. 1. Which sets are the set of all solutions to some LMI? 2. Can one change variables to achieve free convexity? 3. Find the  convex hull of a  semialgebraic set? These can be built as projections of certain convex sets, as was analysed by J. Nie and the investigator. Free convex hulls are very intriguing. 4. Noncommutative real algebraic geometry: In another direction, started by Hilbert's 17th problem, are algebraic certificates  equivalent to statements like one polynomial is positive where another one is positive? The development of noncommutative analogs of this are going well and considerable work is in progress. 5. A cornerstone of classical real algebraic geometry is that projections of semialgebraic sets are semialgebraic. Recent theorems (by the investigator and collaborators) imply this is (overwhelmingly) false in the matricial world, producing a barrage of questions.<br/><br/>The proposed work bears on, semidefinite programming, a type of convex optimization found in many branches of science and engineering. In particular what one sees in linear systems engineering and control are problems with matrix unknowns. Simplifying physical problems and converting them to convex ones is currently done (in thousands of papers) by ad hoc algebraic tricks. The goal in the proposal is to develop a theory (a noncommutative real algebraic geometry) which might be used to systematize this. In addition the investigator's group are the main providers of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommuting algebra calculations in the software program Mathematica. An emphasis now is on algorithms for treating noncommutative inequalities. Also the group does numerical optimization based on a floor of noncommutative algebra calculation. The project will engage graduate and some undergraduate students in summer research and computational projects. This lab experience with applications will broaden the training of students, many of whom get degrees in pure mathematics."

From a mathematical point of view, most of the problems the principal investigator intends to address lie at the cutting-edge of research in partial differential equations. The dynamics of various equations with large data is a very important problem in the field. Some major breakthroughs have been achieved during the past few years, and the analysis involved is highly nontrivial. Understating the impact of the geometry of the target manifold on the evolution of the equation (in the case of Schrodinger maps and spin-models) is of great interest. Research into systems that lack scaling (like the Zakharov system) is extremely challenging, especially in the absence of usable conservation laws. While, strictly speaking, the problems to be explored in this project belong to the field of partial differential equations, the research requires the use of fine tools from other areas of mathematics, notably harmonic analysis and Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/><br/>One of the main reasons that mathematics is useful to the broad scientific community, and in turn to society as a whole, is that it provides one of the most rigorous frameworks for constructing theories that explain the world around us and predict future events. The field of partial differential equations is, to a great extent, the study of models arising from physics. Everyone is aware of the existence of light, heat, fluid flow, magnetism, etc. These are all natural phenomena that, once they are well understood, can lead to major discoveries whose impact on human lives is tremendous. A scientific approach to the study of a natural phenomenon follows a standard pattern. One investigates the complexity of the phenomenon, determines its essential features, and writes down a differential equation that describes the evolution in time of the object under study. Next, one studies the long-time behavior of the mathematical model and describes its evolution in qualitative terms. (In the event that this process identifies potential singularities, a prime interest of the principal investigator, then the phenomenon becomes directly relevant to the current project.) Finally, if the mathematical analysis agrees with the empirical observation of the phenomenon, then the mathematical model is validated, which often opens a wide range of possible applications. On the other hand, if discrepancies arise between the mathematics and the empirical observations, then one seeks to refine the mathematical model, usually by allowing for greater complexity. The new model undergoes a similar mathematical analysis and so on, until a good mathematical model matching the physical reality is found."

By suggesting an analytic approach, they find criterions for the embeddability of CR manifolds into the model manifolds and associate the CR transversality of the map with the geometry of the CR manifolds.  Zhang will continue to explore effective methods to study the CR transversality and the finite jet determination in their full generality.

It is well known via the pseudo-differential operator theory that the regularity of the Cauchy-Riemann operator is closely related to the geometry of the boundary of the domain. Zhang and her collaborators will study a variety of geometric type conditions on the boundary. In the meanwhile, they will investigate the regularity problem of Cauchy-Riemann equations over pseudoconvex domains through the method of integral representation theory. Since the solutions are explicitly expressed in terms of singular kernels derived from the boundary conditions, it provides a direct way to understand the relationship between holomorphic function theory and the geometry of the domain where functions are defined.<br/><br/>This mathematics research project is in the areas of several complex variables and partial differential equations, which are two fundamental sub-disciplines of modern mathematics. The new ideas presented in this project may lead to new applications in  computational mathematics, as well as new applications to other disciplines such as fluid dynamics, where the use of complex variables  has been known to reduce complex flows to very simple systems, and electrical engineering, where complex variables have  been intensively used to analyze circuits with alternating current. Since the techniques to be used and developed in this project are accessible to graduate students, collaborations with other junior researchers and graduate students will be an integral part of this project.

The proposed research is motivated by the following fundamental question: how much does a von Neumann algebra remember about the group or group action it was constructed from? This question is intimately related to topics in ergodic theory, group theory and descriptive set theory and has recently generated a flurry of interactions with these fields. During the last decade, Popa's deformation/rigidity theory has led to a wealth of rigidity results. These show that a lot of information about groups or group actions can be read by looking at their von Neumann algebras. Recently, the first classes of group actions and groups which are von Neumann superrigid (i.e. which can be entirely reconstructed from their von Neumann algebras) have been discovered. The investigator intends to continue this line of research and develop new methods to extend the scope of rigidity and superrigidity in von Neumann algebras. The proposed research will combine von Neumann algebraic techniques from deformation/rigidity theory with tools from ergodic theory and representation theory of groups.  The investigator expects that the proposed research project will also lead to new interactions between these fields and the theory of von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/>In mathematics, rigidity refers to an ideal-like situation in which understanding part of the structure of an object is enough to unravel the object's entire structure. Over the years, rigidity results have appeared in various areas of mathematics. Recently, deformation/rigidity theory has cemented the role of von Neumann algebras as a fertile framework for studying rigidity. It has led to the resolution of many long-standing problems not only in von Neumann algebras, but in orbit equivalence ergodic theory and descriptive set theory as well. In the coming years, the theory has great potential to find new applications to these areas as well as surprising connections with other fields.  The proposed project is well suited to the training of graduate students.  It includes many directions of study and open problems that sprung from deformation/rigidity theory.  The results deriving from this project will be broadly disseminated through publications, lecture series, and talks. The investigator intends to continue promoting interactions between von Neumann algebras and other subjects within the broad theme of rigidity through active involvement in the organization of conferences and seminars."

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

Dynamical entropy theory began with the work of Kolmogorov (1958) who used it <br/>to study actions of the group of integers. In the seventies and eighties, entropy theory was extended first to actions of the integer lattice, and then to actions of amenable groups. Until winter 2007-2008, none of the basic results of entropy theory had been extended to any non-amenable group. Then, the PI discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups is not widely known, but it contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all amenable groups and all linear groups. This was used to solve a long-standing open problem: the classication of Bernoulli shifts over a free group up to measure-conjugacy. After Kolmogorov's initial work, the next major development was Ornstein's creation of a powerful machine, based on entropy, for determining whether two given actions of the integers are measurably-conjugate. This was extended to amenable groups (Ornstein-Weiss) but no comparable theory exists for nonamenable groups. A major research goal of this proposal is to fill this gap by taking advantage of the new entropy theory. In the special case of free group actions, there are close connections to probabilistic combinatorics (especially random regular graphs) and statistical physics models that the PI intends to exploit for the benefit of all three subjects. <br/><br/>The PI plans to hold a workshop at the University of Hawai'i, MAanoa focussed around classication problems in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. This workshop will support the intellectual goals of this proposal, disseminate the most current research ideas in the field and introduce these topics to young researchers and students. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the mathematical community to encourage the diverse student population of the university, especially the native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. This proposal provides directly for the training of a graduate student. It should be particularly easy to attract one because the new entropy theory requires very little background and provides ample unexplored open problems that could have signicant impact in ergodic theory and other areas.<br/>"

This has led to new insight into the structural properties of these von Neumann algebras, and in turn has found applications to other areas such as measured group theory, or the theory of L2-invariants.  The Principal Investigator will continue to investigate and develop these ideas, focusing on their close connection to aspects of ergodic theory.  <br/><br/>Von Neumann algebras were introduced in the 1930's and 40's in part as a tool for developing a mathematical foundation for quantum physics.  Von Neumann algebras have since become a field of independent interest with further applications to areas of mathematics such as ergodic theory, Voiculescu's free probability theory, Jones' theory of subfactors and planar algebras, knot theory, and many others.  The development of von Neumann algebras has also historically been closely connected to the study of measurable dynamics and these connections have recently begun to reemerge in the presence of newly developed rigidity phenomenon.  The investigation of this rigidity phenomenon has since led to new connections between von Neumann algebras and other areas of mathematics.  Furthering the development of rigidity will in turn lead to new insights and connections among these various fields."

In Topology embeddings are used to prove special cases of the Novikov conjecture and the Baum-Connes conjecture. Nevertheless, some of the important problems on embeddings remain open. The main purpose of the project is to achieve progress on problems of the following types. Determine to what extent presence of expander-like structures is the only obstruction to coarse embeddings of spaces with bounded geometry into a Hilbert space. Determine to what extent expanders and graphs with large girth resist nontrivially good embeddings. Determine to what extent the Hilbert space is the most difficult space to embed into. Find characterizations of well-known classes of Banach spaces in terms of embeddings.<br/><br/>Analysis of large sets of data is important in many contexts. Usually data is endowed with a natural distance (degree of dissimilarity) of its elements. One of the useful approaches to analysis of such sets of data is to use some low-distortion embeddings of the set into a space whose structure is well-known, for example into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. After that one can use many algorithms available in computational geometry and many tools from such classical parts of mathematics as Calculus. In some cases one can even visualize the structure of the set, for example, see its clusters. Unfortunately the existence of a low-distortion embedding into a plane is rather rare in applications. In many contexts much weaker (than low-distortion) types of embeddings are still useful, and even embeddings into high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional generalizations of the three-dimensional space lead to important results. Constructions and analysis of such embeddings is the main goal of the proposal."

This operator arises by restricting the classical Cauchy-Riemann operator in complex Euclidean space to a hypersurface or to an appropriate class of manifolds called CR manifolds.  This operator is not invertible.  Thus to understand it, we must understand a related singular integral operator, the Szego projection operator, which is the orthogonal projection of the space of square-integrable functions on a manifold onto the null space of the associated tangential CR operator. The Szego projection is relatively well-understood for boundaries of pseudoconvex domains of finite type. Comparatively little is known if one relaxes the finite-type hypothesis, and even less is known if one relaxes the pseudoconvexity hypothesis.  Exploring these contexts systematically is the goal of the current project.  More specifically,  Halfpap and her collaborators will analyze explicit expressions for the integral kernel associated with the Szego projection for several classes of hypersurfaces and CR manifolds.  The goals are 1) to determine the locations and sizes of the singularities of the Szego kernel,  2) to determine how these are connected to the geometry of the underlying manifold, and 3) to understand the mapping properties of the projection operator itself. <br/><br/>In general, the study of partial differential equations (PDEs) is important because PDEs give a language for describing relationships among changing quantities; some model heat flow, some wave propagation, and some are simply objects of study in their own right.  For a general PDE, several fundamental questions arise:  Can one solve for the unknown function in terms of the given data? Is the solution unique?  If the data are known to have certain special properties (e.g., smoothness or square-integrability) what can be said about the solution? Often one seeks a so-called ``fundamental solution"" -- a kernel function against which one may integrate the data to obtain a solution of the original PDE. Theorems relating properties of the solution to those of the data thus require detailed information about the associated integral kernel function. Frequently, the kernel function has singularities.  In these cases one obtains a singular integral operator. This is the larger context in which the current project is situated, and thus the results of the current project have broader implications for other areas in which PDEs and singular integral operators arise. This mathematics research project also has the potential to increase diversity within mathematics; Halfpap is an active advisor of graduate students (as well as an effective teacher and mentor of undergraduates) at a university serving a largely-rural state."

The problems in the first of these two categories are all specific instances of the following: what can be said about the dimension of a set in d-dimensional space if that set is known to be the union of a particular class of sets of a certain type. The most famous of such problems is the so-called Kakeya conjecture that a set containing a unit line segment in each possible direction must have full dimension. These problems lead directly to the study of the boundedness of operators known as Radon transforms. The problems in the second of the two above-mentioned categories have to do with the extent to which certain given patterns can occur in sets of a certain fixed size. A prototypical example here is the unit distance problem. That problem asks about the number of line segments of length one which can be formed by joining pairs of points chosen from a given set.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project in the areas of Fourier analysis and geometric measure theory has the potential to impact a quite diverse collection of science and technology-related disciplines.

An outstanding problem is to establish the non-linear stability of the Kerr family of black hole solutions, and it is precisely here where the project intends to make a contribution. The past ten years have seen tremendous progress in understanding the boundedness and decay properties of (linear and non-linear) wave equations on black hole backgrounds, a problem which is generally thought of as a primer to the full non-linear stability problem, which would take the full tensorial structure and quasi-linearity of the Einstein equations into account. Previous work of the principal investigator has generalized some of these techniques available for the wave equation to the setting of the Bianchi equations establishing in particular a conditional result on the propagation of regularity and decay in the setting of metrics converging to Schwarzschild. Future research is directed towards generalizing the work to the Kerr setting, as well as to isolate and study an appropriate linear problem for gravitational perturbations in this context. This work will be carried out in collaboration with M. Dafermos and I. Rodnianski. A second research direction is to continue the work on stability and instability of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes initiated by the principal investigator and J. Smulevici in 2011. In particular, in collaboration with J. Luk and J. Smulevici, the principal investigator plans to study the conjectured non-linear instability of anti-de Sitter space within the model of the spherically symmetric scalar field.<br/><br/>General relativity is the currently accepted theory of spacetime dynamics. While the field equations were already written down by Einstein in 1915, the full mathematical content of the theory is still far from being understood. One of the most exciting predictions of the theory is the existence of so-called black hole solutions of the field equations. Some of these can be written down explicitly and one two-parameter family of solutions (the Kerr family) in particular is conjectured to play a fundamental role as the final state of any vacuum gravitational collapse. While there is now sufficient astrophysical evidence that black holes indeed exist in the observable universe,the simple mathematical question of stability of these solutions is unknown. The difficulty of this problem roots in the strong non-linearities in the Einstein equations and their tensorial structure. In this way studying the Einstein equations in the context of black hole stability has broader impact for the entire field of non-linear partial differential equations (a mathematical technique to understand non-linearities may generalize to other equations) and geometry, as well as astrophysical observations."

The second component of this project investigates the existence of automorphisms of positive entropy in complex surfaces and 3-folds. The third component is focused on the complex Henon family of dynamical systems, which has served as an important model family.  These dynamical systems are represented by quite simple polynomials, but they exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors. They have been important because many observed phenomena can actually be proved mathematically.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project is related to the field of study of chaos theory, which has applications to several disciplines, including physics, engineering, economics and biology. An important phenomenon in chaos theory is the so-called butterfly effect, which illustrates the unstable dependence on initial conditions for a given dynamical system. The Henon functions studied in this project have been a fertile testing ground for transformations that have simple formulas but which exhibit the butterfly effect. The study of birational maps has applications to the field of Lattice Statistical Mechanics (LSM) which considers materials that have a lattice structure like crystals.  LSM provides a formula for determining the energy and temperature of such a material in terms of the various interaction energies between the atoms in the lattice. This formula is very difficult to compute, but in many cases there are fundamental symmetries which lead to substantial simplifications.  These symmetries are given by birational maps such as those studied in this project, and the amount of simplification is given by the degree complexity."

In particular, it will investigate regularity for certain classes of Hessian equations, including fourth-order elliptic equations, and also volume-minimizing Lagrangian submanifolds of Euclidean space, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and certain pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Many questions on second-order special Lagrangian equations, including existence and regularity, have witnessed great progress over the last five years.  In this project, the principal investigator intends to study the fourth-order generalization of this equation, which may be even more relevant to physics.  Nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equations represent a young and exciting field, and any progress may be adaptable to other equations and even other physical sciences. Recent and ongoing developments in the theory of optimal transportation show that the structure of the optimal transportation map is related to the geometry of certain maximal calibrated submanifolds of a pseudo-Riemannian space. A goal of the project is to apply the machinery of calibrated manifolds (such as special Lagrangian) to obtain novel results in optimal transport, thereby developing a nice geometric picture.<br/><br/>This project involves research into two exciting areas of mathematics, which appear to be linked together under the surface. The optimal transport problem asks the question of how to transport materials most cost efficiently between two locations. The answers are directly applicable in many areas of science, including economics, medical imaging, fluid mechanics, and meteorology. Development of a strong mathematical theory that emphasizes the crucial elements allows those in industry to implement solutions based on the theory. For example, someone working in logistics may want to know the cheapest way to ship certain goods. Solving the problem by brute force may not be computationally possible, but if a good mathematical theory is available, the solution can be computed efficiently.  Another proposed use of optimal transportation is to create software that assists surgeons in real time.  In order for this to happen, a solid theory is necessary. String theory is an exciting developing branch of physics, which many hope will lead to an understanding of the fundamental interactions of the universe. In the late 1990s, leading mathematical physicists asserted that in order to get a better understanding of string theory, we should try to understand objects called Lagrangian submanifolds. These objects are like minimal surfaces that have special properties and are governed by nonlinear equations. This project attempts to answer questions such as when these surfaces are smooth, when they are flat, and when they are discontinuous. The answers to these questions will impact the study of physics going forward.  Recently, the principal investigator and his collaborators have related the problem of finding the optimal transportation map to the problem of describing a certain type of Lagrangian minimal surface. The smoothness of minimal surfaces has been intensely studied by mathematicians for decades. This project would now like to apply some of the ideas from geometry to the theory of optimal transport."

The first broad area of the proposal centers on the study of singularities in  MCF, including estimates for the size of the singular sets, a compactness theorem for the possible types of singularities, a classification of generic singularities of the flow, and a canonical neighborhoods theorem that describes the flow in a neighborhood of the generic singularities.  These are the most important questions about singularities and the PI and his collaborator have already obtained significant results in this direction.  The second main area of the proposal concerns the structure of Einstein manifolds and, in particular, the question of when an Einstein manifold has a unique asymptotic structure (or tangent cone at infinity).  The main prior result in this direction is due to Cheeger and Tian in 1994, where they showed uniqueness under an integrability assumption that the PI would like to remove.  These sort of uniqueness questions have played an important role in a number of areas of geometric analysis and are extremely important in understanding the structure of the singular set for limits of Einstein manifolds.<br/><br/>This project focuses on several geometric variational problems.  The problems are mathematical, but many of them arose first in science and engineering.  Perhaps the most natural geometrically are minimal surfaces that locally minimize their surface area and, thus, model soap films in perfect equilibrium (so the film does not change other time). These have been studied at least since  Lagrange's 1762 memoir, but recent years have seen breakthroughs on many long-standing problems in the theory of minimal surfaces, with important contributions from many mathematicians.    There is a time-varying analog of this where a surface (which is not in equilibrium) evolves to minimize its surface area as quickly as possible; this is called mean curvature flow or MCF.  Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation  which is formally similar to the equation that governs the flow of heat in physics.  Clearly, minimal surfaces remain static under the MCF.  MCF and other geometric flows were   developed for their intrinsic beauty as well as their potential applications to other fields to model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in annealing metals, and crystal growth.  While key foundational results have been obtained, several of the most basic questions remain unanswered.  In contrast, the Einstein equation is a nonlinear differential equation for the curvature of a space (or a space-time in general relativity).  Hilbert realized a century ago that this comes up variationally as the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Einstein-Hilbert functional."

One application is to investigation of large data sets. Advances in automated data-acquisition techniques (such as digital microscopy) has enabled one to gather large data sets holding a wealth of information.  Such data sets  are often of very high dimension (for example digital images).  To be able to extract the information contained, it is desirable to simplify them with minimal loss of information.  One approach is to approximate the data set by a low-dimensional manifold. This project is concerned with a variational approach using nonlocal energies for parameterizing the data with a curve. The goal is to contribute to understanding of which functionals provide for good data approximation and are amenable to efficient computational implementation. The PI studies the fundamental questions such as existence and regularity of minimizers, as well as numerical implementation and applicability to data sets.  The other line of investigation concerns behavior of  particle systems with long range interaction.  Such systems arise as models of collective behavior of a variety of living organisms (locust, fish, birds, bacteria, and others). Goal of this research is to help explain why and how large, well-organized groups (such as swarms, schools, flocks, etc.) of organisms form. Furthermore to describe mathematically the evolution of these groups, and explain why are they stable and explore how they interact with the environment in particular in the presence of environmental boundaries. The  development of the new mathematical tools, such as gradient flows in spaces of probability measures, provides the techniques that make significant progress on these issues likely.<br/><br/><br/>Being able to extract information from large data sets is a scientific challenge with important practical consequences. The research of the PI can lead to improved algorithms for data parameterization and approximation. This in turn can improve data clustering, classification, visualization, and other tasks.  An example of an application is  improving and automating the diagnostics of some diseases, based on images of tissue samples. Understanding how large groups of a variety of organisms form and behave is an important biological question. It is also one where mathematics, based on simple rules of interaction between individuals, can provide important insights. The knowledge obtained can be used to predict and offer guidance on how such groups (for example locust swarms) could be influenced."

The Navier-Stokes equations bear on the study of fluid flows, both how a fluid will flow through a pipe and how that flow will transport solvents, and what sorts of different behaviors govern flows in pipes with smooth or rough walls.  Nonlinear Schrodinger equations model  various real-life phenomena  and have applications to subjects such as optical cables, surface waves in shallow water, and a delicate state of low temperature matter known as a Bose-Einstein condensate.  Potential applications of the study of equations on rough domains include the investigation of hidden structures, such as sudden transitions in the nature of materials in the earth, often across rough, unknown boundaries, the knowledge of whose locations can be of substantial value.  The mathematical techniques developed in the proposed project will have the potential to impact these areas.  Taylor has directed three Ph.D. students in the past four years, who have begun to make their own contributions to such problems, and he is now beginning to train a new student."

We want to extend the one-dimensional spectraldecomposition for topological polynomials. In addition, we study expanding polymodials, including c-tent plane maps (which combine properties of tent maps with properties of complex quadratic maps and should play the same role for quadratic complex maps as tent maps play on the interval) and seek to replace holomorphic tools by tools based upon the expansiveness of maps.

The analog of spectral decomposition for topological polynomials may provide examples of limit behavior for complicated non-invertible systems from applications (e.g., from population dynamics). Structural results on expanding polymodials would give another class of maps for which analogs of well-known complex dynamical results hold. Finally, topics in one-dimensional dynamics should yield a better understanding of stability of one-dimensional maps and the way different types of limit behavior of a one-dimensional map coexist. The project can have an educational impact as well as impact upon human resources development as some of the topics (such as new results/tools on cubic laminations, on spectral decomposition for topological polynomials and on dynamics of expanding polymodials) could serve as the basis of new courses for graduate students and could be developed by students in their dissertations (in fact, a local seminar is devoted to laminations)."

From fractal objects to porous media, the equations that govern dissipation of quantities such as heat and pressure have non-smooth components. Such non-smooth objects also occur as limits of certain smooth objects. To understand and exploit the behavior of such objects, we need to remove the smoothness assumptions from Riemannian geometry. For such non-smooth objects we need to study behaviors of non-smooth energy minimizers and their connection to the geometry, that is, the structural properties, of the underlying space or object. This project on metric geometry and functions on bounded variation contributes to this goal by exploring interconnections between the geometry of the underlying metric space equipped with a measure, and the properties of sets of minimal surface areas. The study of objects here are metric spaces equipped with a measure that is doubling (that is, measure of a ball is comparable to the measure of a concentric ball of double the radius) and such that the variance of a Lipschitz continuous function on a ball can be controlled in terms of the average value of its energy (computed using its local oscillation) on that ball. In this setting, this project aims to study properties such as rectifiability, porosity, shape, and natural dimension of sets of locally minimal surface areas.<br/><br/>   Analysis on metric measure spaces arose from many sources; the study of complex analytic functions, differential equations governing fractures in mixed material and associated mappings of finite distortion, control theory in engineering and associated Carnot-Caratheodory spaces, the study of the famous Poincare conjecture, are some of the roots of  this field of study. However, unlike in the Euclidean situation where structural properties of minimal surfaces (surfaces with smallest surface energy) are well understood, in the non-smooth setting that arise in nature and in control theory problems of physics and engineering, the structure of minimal surfaces is poorly understood. This project seeks to explore such structures and expand our knowledge of minimal surfaces in a non-smooth setting. The results of this study will be useful in further understanding the change in the behavior of objects that are transformed due to natural effects such as heat and pressure. In addition to advancing our knowledge of non-smooth objects, the study conducted in this project will also contribute to the ongoing  development of the theory of analysis on metric spaces; a great benefit of this developing theory is that since much of the structural tools available in  classical Euclidean analysis are not available in the non-smooth setting, new  tools and methods have necessarily to be developed, making the theory more accessible to a wider audience."

It is motivated by the fact that many real-world signals can be well-approximated by or identified with sparse signals.The proposed research will utilize techniques based on nonlinear sparse representations with respect to redundant systems (dictionaries). The investigator's preliminary results show that, although the prior development of compressed sensing has occurred in Hilbert spaces, substantial improvement can be made in the construction of efficient algorithms for exact recovery of sparse signals when we consider the problem in a Banach space instead. To widen the search for efficient algorithms from Hilbert spaces to Banach spaces is the main fundamentally new idea of this proposal. We intend to study properties of specific methods of recovery that belong to a family of greedy algorithms. These methods allow us to build sparse representations economically. The proposed research will develop practical, implementable algorithms that are provably efficient with respect to convergence, rate of convergence, and exact recovery.<br/><br/>For scientists and other analysts, the great challenges of this decade involve designing systems to efficiently analyze data and extract essential information from large data sets. It has a myriad of existing and potential applications in both the defense and civilian sectors. For example, managing large data bases, such as security data bases obtained through surveillance, requires classification and compression of the data in order to facilitate the extraction of significant features or specific information. More generally, the problem of compression and denoising of large data sets arises naturally in biology, medicine, and many other fields. The scientific discipline that studies this aspect of data processing is called 'compressed sensing.' The goal of the proposed research is to build a fundamental mathematical theory that will significantly increase our ability to process (compress, denoise, etc.) large data sets. The main technique that will be used to achieve this goal is based on nonlinear sparse representations arising from greedy approximation methods (greedy algorithms), which allow us to build sparse representations economically. It is the goal of this proposal to utilize fundamental concepts in analysis and applied mathematics to clearly define and quantify the data processing challenge and design new, more efficient techniques (greedy algorithms) to address it. We believe that scientists and other analysts will be able to implement our results to find essential information in large data sets more quickly and more accurately than before."

Furthermore, it will develop sophisticated new methods for approximation and numerical computation using these systems. The project lies at the interface between computational harmonic analysis, spectral decompositions, orthogonal polynomials, nonlinear approximation and numerical analysis. It is organized into two main directions of investigation with several specific goals. The first research objective of the project is to develop frames with elements of nearly exponential space localization in the general setting of strictly local regular Dirichlet spaces with doubling measure and local scale-invariant Poincare inequality which lead to a Markovian heat kernel with small time Gaussian bounds and Holder continuity. The key point of the proposed approach is to be able to deal with (a) different geometries, (b) compact and noncompact spaces, and (c) spaces with nontrivial weights, and at the same time to allow for the frame decomposition of Besov and other spaces with complete range of indices. This will facilitate the development of well localized frames in the context of Lie groups or homogeneous spaces with polynomial volume growth, Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below and other new settings. The development of frames on the simplex and on graphs is another aim of this project. The second core objective of this project is the development of adaptive representations in the framework of anisotropic dilations of the space. Anisotropic phenomena appear in various contexts in analysis, PDEs and in applications. For instance, functions are frequently very smooth on subdomains of Rd separated by smooth curves or manifolds. This project aims at resolving this kind of singularities of functions (and more general singular behaviors) by utilizing the framework of anisotropic multiscale dilations of d-dimensional space or its subdomain, which may change rapidly from point to point at any level and in depth. The main strands of this approach are (i) the development of algorithms for rapid construction of best or near best dilation matrices leading to optimal sparsity, (ii) the construction of highly localized anisotropic frames and their utilization to representation and approximation of functions.<br/><br/>Many scientific areas require efficient representation of the underlying functions in the natural topology of the targeted application. The capturing of physical phenomena occurring at various scales requires locally supported multiscale systems relative to the application domains. Moreover, these systems should be amenable to fast and accurate computation. Such systems (called needlets) have been recently developed by the investigator and his collaborators for the sphere and the ball. The needlets are the outcome of a complete rethinking of data representations in the context of classical orthogonal and spectral representations and break new conceptual and practical ground, going far beyond traditional multiscale ideas like wavelets. Spherical needlets have already had a significant impact in cosmology/astrophysics for the statistical study of the cosmic microwave background radiation data. This award will support the development of image and data processing techniques, which will lead to much novel representation systems in new mathematical settings, allowing the treatment of new data structures. It will also enhance our fundamental understanding of complicated processes through the development of innovative adaptive methods for efficient (sparse) representation and approximation of geometrical objects that have jumps or other sharp transitions along curves or surfaces. It has the potential to impact many areas ranging from image processing and edge detection to geopotential, oceanographic and atmospheric modeling, and to physics and cosmology."

The project has three main themes. The first is to study the sheaf cohomology groups of certain infinite-dimensional manifolds and their loop spaces. The huge amount of experience from finite dimensions and the much smaller, but growing, amount of experience in infinite dimensions suggest that cohomological questions will be central to analysis and geometry in infinite dimensions. The overarching questions are: (1) How is the infinite-dimensional theory different from the finite-dimensional theory, and how are the two similar? (2) What kind of information concerning a manifold can be gleaned from the cohomology groups of its loop spaces? A concrete problem to be considered is to endow the cohomology groups of infinite-dimensional manifolds with a suitable topology and to ask whether theorems like Leray's isomorphism theorem or a relative version of Serre duality theorem can be proved. The second theme of the project concerns direct images of Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles (over finite-dimensional manifolds) under not-necessarily-proper maps. The best one can expect is that direct images will be smooth fields of Hilbert spaces, a recent generalization of vector bundles. The principal investigator will explore topics such as the following ones: geometric conditions that imply the direct image is indeed a smooth field of Hilbert spaces; the curvature of the direct image; and the theory of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in holomorphic fields of Hilbert spaces. The third theme concerns the space of Kahler metrics on a given Kahler manifold. This is an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and the project will investigate its geodesics.<br/><br/>One of the roles of mathematics is to provide the terms in which to describe the world around us. As we are discovering more and more complicated phenomena, both natural and societal, it is critical that the descriptions nevertheless stay simple. Mathematics achieves this by introducing new notions. Here is an example that is pertinent to this project. Quantities in the real world are measured by real numbers, and since the invention of analytic geometry we know that real world figures (e.g., curves, surfaces) can be described by functions of real variables. Yet real world quantities in oscillatory phenomena, for example voltage in alternating current, can be described much more simply in terms of complex numbers. It takes some investment of time and energy to introduce complex numbers, but once this is done, the descriptions of the phenomena become fully transparent. By now we understand well that complex numbers are indispensable in a huge number of problems. Similarly, one is often forced to pass from functions of real variables and the figures they describe to functions of complex variables and the associated geometric figures. Real world phenomena often involve a vast number of parameters to control, and their treatment requires working with functions of a vast number of variables. It again turns out that introducing a new mental construct, functions of infinitely many variables, oftentimes simplifies the understanding of those phenomena. This project, continuing earlier research of the prinicipal investigator, is directed towards uncovering fundamental properties of functions of infinitely many complex variables and the associated figures, so-called infinite-dimensional complex manifolds. Part of the project will investigate what bearing the infinite-dimensional theory has on finite-dimensional, closer-to-home problems. Some of the concrete problems in the project are directly motivated by quantum theory and have the potential to impact theoretical physics. By involving graduate students, the project will also serve to introduce young people to mathematical research."

These equations can be either defocusing or focusing, which distinguishes whether the nonlinearity is attractive or repulsive. In the latter case, one typically encounters various regimes depending on the power of the nonlinearity, which allows for rich dynamics ranging from long-term existence and dispersion, to finite-time blowup. Recently, in joint work with Kenji Nakanishi from Kyoto University, Japan, the principal investigator has given a complete characterization of all possible dynamics at energies close to the ground state energy for a large class of these focusing dispersive wave equations. This classification is achieved by a combination of dynamical systems methods (hyperbolic dynamics, invariant manifolds), with partial differential equations arguments such as concentration compactness and the Kenig-Merle theory. Several important open problems remain, among which is to obtain this type of classification for the energy critical nonlinear wave equation.  This is particularly relevant in view of the related but complementary research by Duyckaerts-Kenig-Merle on focusing equations.  A long-term goal is to establish the soliton-resolution conjecture. This conjecture can be viewed as the nonlinear analogue of the celebrated asymptotic completeness property of the linear Schroedinger evolution. <br/><br/>Nonlinear wave equations play a central role in science. Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics are of this type, and they are arguably the most influential partial differential equations of modern science -- the existence of radio waves, and general electromagnetic radiation such as light and X-rays was predicted in the 1870s by Maxwell based on these equations alone and confirmed by experiment later that century. Needless to say, it is unthinkable to remove radio transmission, X-rays, lasers, microwaves, and many other electromagnetic radiation fields from our daily lives.  In addition, Maxwell's wave equations have had theoretical impact far beyond anything of which nineteenth-century physicists and mathematicians could have conceived. Indeed, they make the constancy of the speed of light most natural, and the symmetries of Maxwell's system lead directly to Einstein's theory of special relativity. Unifying the latter with gravity then led to the general theory of relativity. In addition, quantum theory has provided many more examples of wave equations, in many cases nonlinear ones. For example, special solutions that go by the name of ""dispersion managed solitons,"" and that solve a certain class of nonlinear Schroedinger equations arising in nonlinear optics, are indispensable today for the transmission of the world's internet traffic through carefully designed glass fiber cables. The introduction of these special cables, which consist of alternating stretches of different materials, drastically reduced transmission errors and cost, and allowed for a huge increase in the data volume being transmitted. This project focuses on the further development and study of nonlinear wave equations of the type that arise in many areas of physics and engineering. Time and time again, mathematicians have laid the foundations through pure research without which the engineering applications that profoundly affect our daily lives could not have been accomplished."

The second project is aimed at solving a conjecture of Hitchin on the nonvanishing of primitive adjoint invariant forms restricted to certain subspaces of a semisimple Lie algebra.

The aim of the fourth project is to study the saturated tensor cone for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras.

Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is considered to be one the most important open problems in the field. In addition, it is expected that the solution will spawn a lot of activity in the area. Two books authored by the principal investigator (one of these coauthored with M.

This conference will bring together experts in the fields of microlocal and geometric analysis, which dramatically impact the study of partial differential equations, geometry, topology and spectral theory. Though such fields rarely interact in focused conferences, they often have an overlap of useful techniques and ideas that would allow for collaborations to make advancements in both analysis and geometry. In particular, the conference would bring together many experts whose insights into geodesic  flow and geometry could dramatically inform and advance the University of North Carolina analysis group's efforts to understand the existence and dynamics of nonlinear bound states on manifolds, which have arisen in the studies of both geometry and dispersive equations.<br/> <br/>This project supports participation in the conference on Partial Differential Equations - Analytic and Geometric Aspects. Funds will be used for the travel and housing costs for speakers, graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty at U.S. universities without NSF support who would like to participate in the conference. This workshop will reflect the main areas of focus of the partial differential equations group at the University of North Carolina, which has grown around distinguished senior faculty member Michael Taylor, who has made fundamental contributions to PDE throughout his career, in particular helping to develop the topics of microlocal and geometric analysis in the study thereof. The group has wishes to bring in experts and students from around the world to discuss recent advances, in particular related to nonlinear partial differential equations on manifolds and applications.  Such techniques have led to a surge in activity touching such areas as general relativity, fluid mechanics, and nonlinear optics.

In recent work with M.Mirzakhani, the PI was able to prove some dynamical rigidity results for this action, which allow one to understand every (and not just almost every) orbit. This is important for several reasons. In particular, the surfaces which arise from billiards are a set of measure zero in the moduli space, and ergodic theorems which hold at every point are needed to prove results about billiards. Many of the results and techniques are based on a loose analogy with the theory of unipotent flows on locally symmetric spaces (e.g. Ratner's theorem).  However, the moduli spaces of differentials are substantially different, and new ideas were needed.   The PI proposes additional research in this direction.<br/><br/>Some natural phenomena are ``chaotic'' (i.e. unpredictable). These are often studied by statistical methods. Others are ``integrable'' (i.e. predictable and regular). Other phenomena fit somewhere in between. The polygonal billiard system, which is one of the main subjects of study of the proposal,  is a good model of intermediate behavior. As such it has been studied extensively in physics as well, in particular in connection to``quantum chaos''. The PI believes that the new techniques and tools  introduced will have applications in these and other fields."

The objective of the first  part of the project is to study the Weil-Petersson flow on moduli space and the geometry of its geodesics. This metric is fundamental in studying properties of moduli space. There are many important connections between the Weil-Petersson metric  and the hyperbolic geometry and dynamics of surfaces.

These research goals will be carried out through a variety of modalities, including published papers in peer-reviewed journals, a collaborative book project, supervising Ph.D. students, and speaking at conferences, including the upcoming International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad, India.<br/><br/>The principal investigator is a leading expert in the field of partially hyperbolic dynamics. A dynamical system is a system (for example, a state space for a physical process) that evolves over time according to a deterministic set of rules. Well-studied classes of dynamical systems include the so-called hyperbolic systems, which display chaotic, unpredictable features at every point, and KAM systems, which have stable regions of regular motion. The partially hyperbolic systems are a more general class of dynamical systems than the hyperbolic class, and include systems that combine hyperbolicity in some directions with KAM behavior in other directions.  Partially hyperbolic systems occur widely in dynamical systems that arise in physics. For example, planetary motion usually contains partially hyperbolic subdynamics. The principal investigator has had a well-developed research plan for over fifteen years to study partially hyperbolic systems and is poised to raise the theory of these systems to a new level of generality and applicability."

In 1912 Hermann Weyl published his paper establishing the Weyl law which gives the leading asymptotic description for the counting function of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet or Neumann Laplacian on a bounded domain in the Euclidean space.

The workshop is intended as a forward-looking celebration of the 100th anniversary of Weyl's paper.   Among the directions to be explored are the (conjectured) connection between random matrix theory and <br/>high energy distribution of differences between eigenvalues, probabilistic Weyl laws for non-self-adjoint <br/>operators, distribution of scattering resonances and fractal Weyl laws, and physical experiments related to quantum chaos and inverse problems.   <br/><br/>All of the conference topics are central to analysis and are extremely active areas of research.

Such modeling activities are of great importance, e.g.  one wishes to model the transport of electric current through various materials on the surface of a computer chip.  The problem is highly dependent on the structure of the solid: for material that ""has a pattern"" a very successful theory- Bloch theory- has been developed that serves as a very good physical and mathematical model.  The goal of this research is to develop an analog  to Bloch theory for those solids that are without any repeating pattern.   Besides its own intrinsic scientific  interest, such a theory could have technological implications in electronics, instrumentation, and the like.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, a lot of information about the electronic behavior of periodic crystals has been obtained through the so-called ""Bloch Theory"". It has led to a substantial understanding of properties of metals, insulators, and semiconductors as long as they are periodic crystals and the electron interactions can be neglected. In particular, numerical methods are routinely used to compute the band spectrum of such materials. Bloch Theory is more efficiently justified through the ""Wannier transform"". In particular, it allowed to a theoretical description of impurities in semiconductors, leading to substantial progress in their practical use.<br/>Nothing like the Bloch theory exists for aperiodic materials, namely for most of materials available in material science. Physicists have relied upon tricks, approximations, effective models and numerical methods. This led sometimes to seminal results like the theory of Anderson localization, Renormalization Group Analysis and spectacular effects like the Quantum Hall effect that led to a change in the definition of the resistance standard. The discovery of quasicrystals in the mid eighties changed the trend dramatically: the lack of Bloch theory made it an outstanding challenge to predict the electronic properties of such materials. Various approximation schemes have been used, but the accuracy of the results is questionable and the heaviness of the software makes it essentially impossible to go beyond two dimensions. There is an urgent need of a robust mathematical theory to overcome these difficulties.  The present project is one step towards such a goal. Using the full strength of progress made during the last thirty years, partly by the PI, the present proposal proposes a construction of the Wannier transform for aperiodic solids having ""finite local complexity"". The construction relies heavily upon the developments made in the eighties by the PI, using the tools of Noncommutative Geometry. It also uses the developments made in the nineties by a small community of younger mathematicians, including the PI, to describe precisely tilings with finite local complexity. This proposal intends to go beyond the Wannier transform to give a tool to predict the nature of the electronic spectrum, hopefully leading to numerical codes that will enable to compute the properties of specific materials."

Another topic is the regularity of nonlinear dispersive PDE such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Erdogan and his collaborators recently obtained smoothing bounds for KdV, and found applications to long-term behavior of the solutions.

A better understanding of the underlying mathematical structure may be useful in improving these systems. The dispersive decay and smoothing estimates have a wide range of applications in nonlinear partial differential equations modeling diverse physical phenomena.

A theory, now called direct methods of the calculus of variations, was developed by Charles Morrey in the middle of the last century wherein he introduced various fundamental concepts of convexity. This theory has wide application to many fields, including John Ball's groundbreaking work in elasticity theory. Recently, John Ball published a list of outstanding problems in the calculus of variations whose solutions will not only  advance that field but will also have major impacts in elasticity theory.  In recent work, the principal investigator has started to develop tools to handle specific concrete problems from that list. This will, he hopes, lead to general theories.  The project will extend this study to include important classes of variational problems that have defied existing theory, such as the stored energy functional of Ogden material, which appears in elasticity. Another class of problems to be studied arises in mass transportation theory.  It was first formulated by Monge in 1771 as a simple geometry problem and later extended by Kantorovich to more general cost functions. It consists in finding the optimal (minimal work) method for transporting a pile of earth at one location to an excavation site at another  location. These classical results have been extended  to more  general cost functions by the principal investigator, his students, postdocs, collaborators and many others, with special attention to the Wasserstein (or Kantorovich) metric.  Building on these results, the project will investigate so-called axi-symmetric flows, which preliminary computations indicate are Hamiltonian systems on the Wasserstein space.  The principal investigator has established a link between the study of these flows and a poorly understood (challenging) class of parameter-dependent Monge-Ampere equations. He will study the existence of paths satisfying a certain basic stability criterion and connecting two prescribed symplectic forms. These problems, interesting in their own right, include searching for geodesics in the set of symplectic forms.<br/><br/>Tproject will have a number of important scientific and educational components.  First, the theoretical advances will directly aid other scientific research areas, including meteorology, elasticity theory, and other applied sciences, that use variational methods in their algorithms. Second, the principal investigator will continue to disseminate the research by giving courses and lectures in international conferences, workshops, and seminars. Finally, in addition to continuing to mentor undergraduates and Ph.D. students at his home institution, he will extend his active support of underrepresented groups in mathematics, in part by mentoring students and faculty at Spelman College, a local HBCU. Current projects involve Spelman's Professor Yewande Olubummo, who together with the principal investigator plans to develop tools for use in the study of shape recognition."

A recurring theme is the study of generic dimension distortion properties of mappings. Several problems are posed concerning precise, quantitative statements of the frequency with which given Hausdorff dimension bounds hold relative to a specified parameter space: such frequency is measured with respect to measures on the parameter space (in many cases, these parameterizing measures are themselves Hausdorff measures). The preceding themes will be developed in two contexts: (i) metric space-valued Sobolev mappings, and (ii) linear and nonlinear projection-type mappings defined on the Heisenberg group and other Carnot groups. Another theme covered by the proposed research program concerns new aspects of the analytic theory of quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings on the Heisenberg group. This includes both novel constructions of such mappings as well as emerging connections to partial differential equations and sub-Riemannian exterior differential calculus as formulated by Rumin. Additional topics included in the proposal include density of Lipschitz mappings in spaces of Heisenberg group-valued Sobolev mappings, and Hausdorff measure negligibility of highly characteristic points on submanifolds in sub-Riemannian Carnot groups. <br/><br/>This research program lies at the intersection of geometry and analysis. Geometry is the study of the structure of space, both the familiar Euclidean spaces of classical antiquity as well as more recent, exotic spaces. Analysis is the study of change and motion: its origins lie in the theory of differential and integral calculus developed by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century, clarified and rigorously formulated by Cauchy, Weierstrass, Riemann and others in the second half of the 19th century, and finally extended to its modern form in the 20th century in work of Lebesgue, Hilbert, Hardy and (later) Sobolev. The two subjects interact extensively: geometric structure both influences and is influenced by the dynamic, analytic behavior of mappings between spaces. Sobolev spaces provide a framework for quantifying the analytic properties of `non-smooth' functions and mappings. They are a foundational tool in modern approaches to partial differential equations. Understanding analysis on such spaces is important for several reasons. First, such understanding provides new perspectives on the classical theory, highlighting relevant and necessary features of the underlying geometry. At the same time, this abstract approach has a greater range of applicability. Techniques and results from analysis on metric spaces have found application in the study of metric graphs and networks, fractals and other geometric environments such as sub-Riemannian spaces. Sub-Riemannian geometries arise in `external' applications to mathematical models of control theory, robotic path planning and neurobiology, as well as `internal' applications to other branches of pure mathematics such as several complex variables, symplectic and contact geometry and geometric group theory. One aspect of the proposed research involving sub-Riemannian mapping theory relates to mathematical models in impedance tomography and image reconstruction."

Coordinate systems are widely used in both application and theory, strongly connecting these problems to other areas of mathematics such as approximation theory, descriptive set theory, and differential topology.  For example, new Banach spaces are often constructed by explicitly building a basis for the space. In this spirit, this project will address the construction of new Banach spaces with the property that every bounded operator on the space is a multiple of the identity plus a compact operator. Moreover, the project will also study the greedy approximation properties of coordinate systems in Banach spaces. Greedy approximation is based on the idea of always taking the ""biggest piece"" in each step of an iterative algorithm. This project will consider the existence of greedy bases and the convergence of greedy algorithms in particular Banach spaces.  Beyond greedy approximation, this project intends to extend the descriptive set theory approach to bases, which has given remarkable insight into the structural theory of Banach spaces, to that of frames. Furthermore, this project will work on adapting the techniques and structure of Hilbert and Banach frames to the continuously varying setting of vector bundles.<br/><br/><br/>The structural attributes of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces make them ideal settings for analyzing many problems in mathematics and engineering. A common example is encoding and transmitting signals. Bases in a Hilbert space or Banach space give a unique representation  for the vectors in the space while the representation given by a frame is redundant.  Signal encoding and transmission is often accomplished by sending coefficients with respect to some basis. This strategy, however, is not robust in the face of error, as any loss or corruption of basis coefficients results in the loss of entire dimensions of the signal. This is where frames come in as their redundancy distributes error loss over the whole space instead of concentrating it in isolated dimensions. Frames now play an important role in signal processing, and the study of their geometry in both Hilbert and Banach spaces is a growing area of research. Additionally, sometimes it is important to consider not just a single vector space, but some related collection of spaces. For example, the tangent bundle of a surface is the collection of tangent planes to the surface.  In this case we want a basis for the tangent space at each point which moves smoothly over the surface. It is impossible to find such a basis for many surfaces. On the contrary, it is always possible to find a redundant<br/>frame for the tangent space which moves smoothly.  Given this, it is naturally of interest to study such frames."

The proposed treatment of these questions can be briefly described as follows. One represents the Hilbert space on which the contractive semigroup acts as a chain of subspaces so that on each of the subspaces the semigroup acts almost as a group of unitaries. The corresponding spectral picture produces a chain of spaces of analytic functions. The goal is then to understand the properties of the semigroup by investigating these spaces and their relationship to the spaces generated by a certain model semigroup. The latter often reduces to a problem about invertibility properties of certain Toeplitz operators. In its essence, the method that the investigator suggests to treat these problems can be viewed as a delicate form of the classical argument principle. It has in its basis the powerful method of N. Makarov and A. Poltoratski regarding the injectivity problem for Toeplitz operators. As is often the case in harmonic analysis, the delicate properties of the Hilbert transform again should play the central role.<br/><br/>The majority of the problems proposed in this project lie within the area of harmonic analysis. The core idea of harmonic analysis is the possibility of representing complicated signals as a combination of simpler signals - atoms which are in a sense canonical for the problem at hand. Due to the imprecision of measurements one is sometimes required to use a slightly different system of atoms,  which may or may not possess the ideal properties of the canonical system. Careful analysis is required to determine to which extent the properties present under ideal measurements continue to hold in a real world situation. A large part of this project is devoted to the further development of the mathematical tools necessary for such an analysis. Potential applications are possible in the areas of signal processing and control theory. In addition, another goal of this project is to popularize the classical areas of harmonic and complex analysis by softening some existing deep techniques, thus making them more accessible to the future generations of mathematicians as well as to other scientists. As a member of a major science-technology university, the investigator will also incorporate some of these new ideas to offer an up-to-date, quality education of the new generations of STEM majors, at both the undergraduate and graduate level."

Fractals have a lot of structure that can be used to advantage in this task.  Strichartz has contributed to the development of this area and its connections to classical ``smooth"" analysis, and will continue his research in this area.  In particular, he will investigate problems in the following general categories:  Laplacians on Julia sets, Spectral theory, boundary value problems and Sobolev spaces, Hodge De Rham theory of k-forms, mean value properties of harmonic functions, the infinity-Laplacian, integral geometry, physically realistic models, Littlewood-Paley theory, sampling based on mean values, Peano curves, removable singularities , and thick carpets.  Some of the research will involve ``experimental mathematics"" to be carried out in collaboration with undergraduate students (mainly REU students).  Strichartz has been a leader in the field for the past 15 years.  He has been able to bring to this area a broad expertise in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations and analysis on manifolds, and has succeeded in broadening the scope of research in this area.  This mathematics research project will continue this development.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project deals the study of fractals. Scientists use fractals to model many real world phenomena.  Electrical engineers build antennae, and chemists build molecules with the geometry of specific fractals studied in this project.  The development of the mathematical theory of analysis on fractals may provide scientists with useful tools for their work.  For an example of an important scientific problem that demands the technique being developed in this project, consider the question of what happens when sunlight hits the top of a cloud.  Some of the heat is reflected back into space, and some is absorbed into the cloud.  The best model of a cloud is as a fractal mixture of water vapor and air.  A scientific experiment will be required to determine the most suitable specific fractal model to use, and this most likely will depend on the type of cloud.  After the fractal geometry is chosen, it will still require the analysis of the solution of the heat equation on such fractals to resolve the problem.  The heat equation is an example of the type of differential equations studied in this project.  Strichartz is currently supervising the research of a graduate student in physics, with the goal of studying analysis on physically realistic fractal models.  Strichartz has been a leader in the development of experimental techniques in mathematics.  The proposed research will continue this development.  Strichartz  has successfully mentored nearly 100 undergraduate students in research work (including many women and several underrepresented minorities), largely through the REU program. Strichartz has written a book, suitable for undergraduates and graduate students to introduce them to the field and has organized conferences with a strong educational component."

The principal investigator will focus on understanding the nature of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measures and the statistics of relevant observations for nonequilibrium phenomena, using innovative approaches related to the study of chaotic systems. While sophisticated techniques have been developed and beautiful results obtained for equilibrium systems, the research topics of random and chaotic behavior in nonequilibrium systems have remained wide open. The reason for this is that chaotic phenomena in these settings have quite a different flavor from those in the equilibrium context. Recently developed mathematical tools in hyperbolic systems offer hope for significant progress. This project seeks to obtain both a theoretical understanding of and new ways to connect mathematical ideas to a variety of complex phenomena by addressing two challenging issues through the use of spectral analysis, the coupling method, and other innovative approaches. The first concerns statistical properties of nonequilibrium hyperbolic systems (e.g.,to prove the existence of SRB measures that characterize the steady states; to study the time correlation functions that relate to the diffusion matrix in the transport processes; to verify other limiting theorems for perturbed hyperbolic systems).  Specific models include Lorentz gases under general forces, an ideal gas with slow-moving scatterers, and random systems with microstructure. The second issue has to do with properties of SRB measures and related physical laws (e.g., to understand the nature of SRB measures, including their entropy and Hausdorff dimensions; to obtain Ohm's law, the Einstein relation, and other physical laws for certain nonequilibrium hyperbolic systems that arise in physics).<br/><br/>This project will use mathematical tools to address applied problems in physics, chemical engineering, and other sciences. The theory of hyperbolic systems has provided excellent models or paradigms for understanding chaos and diffusion processes in systems that are random or changing over time. The goal is to capture the major complexity of these systems, from integrability to chaotic behavior, without the difficulty of integrating the equations of motion. As the study of physical invariant measures and their asymptotic statistical properties provides new insight into the nature of steady states and transport phenomena, the project will contribute to modern statistical physics and chemical engineering. Thus, it will have a broad impact outside of mathematics in the physical sciences and within the broader scientific community. The principal investigator plans to motivate and excite students about research on chaotic systems by directing graduate student research, by incorporating research-related concepts and simulations of nonequilibrium systems into new undergraduate courses, thereby enhancing research experiences for undergraduates (REUs), and by carrying out K-12 outreach activities. The research will be integrated into both graduate and undergraduate research projects, as well as into curriculum development. The principal investigator will seek institutional approval for a new topics course for graduate students on stochastic differential equations and a new undergraduate course that will focus on topics related to chaos and fractals. She will initiate a Guest Lecture Series at the Amherst Regional High School on topics related to chaos and fractal geometry, in order to engage local high school students in this interdisciplinary, cutting-edge research. She will also organize annual workshops for high school girls that will include hands-on scientific activities and career discussions with individual pursuing careers in the mathematical sciences, academic or otherwise. The project will broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities and help them to visualize the beauty of mathematics."

Fifty years ago Paul Cohen developed the method of forcing to solve Hilbert's first problem: the truth of the Continuum Hypothesis.  Today this method is more relevant than ever.  While it was originally developed as a meta-mathematical tool, it has been also used to solve problems arising in combinatorics, functional analysis, and topology.  As the method matured and became even more powerful, its scope and reach has been significantly broadened. New directions in forcing are ever more influenced by fundamental questions in a broadening range of fields.  Stunning breakthroughs in these related fields are being propelled by the equally exciting advances in the forcing method.  Still, the method has largely remained a tool used internally by set theory.  The program aims to further develop the method and its applicability analysis, combinatorics, operator theory, set theory, and topology.<br/><br/>The Fields Institute is one of the premier mathematical institutes in the world.  Each semester it sponsors a thematic program in a focused sub-discipline of mathematics, bringing senior leaders in the field together with graduate students and junior researchers, all under one roof.  In fall 2012, the focus of the thematic program is Cohen's method of forcing.  The semester will feature three focused workshops and two semester long graduate courses, all attracting an international audience.  One of the primary goals of the program is to make this important technique accessible to a broader cross section of the mathematical community."

Specifically, the principal investigator considers global well-posedness, scattering, soliton formation, and finite-time blowup questions for equations such as the following: nonlinear Schrodinger outside nontrapping domains, Gross-Pitaevskii, nonlinear Schrodinger with combined focusing and defocusing nonlinearities, generalized Korteweg-de Vries. The common feature of these equations is that each has one or more broken symmetries such as spatial-translation, scaling, or Galilei invariance. By this is meant that, while the solution can concentrate at arbitrary positions in space (or length scales or frequency locations), the evolution depends nontrivially on the position (or scale or frequency location) of concentration. One of the remarkable new phenomena that can occur in this setting is that minimizing sequences of solutions to an equation with broken symmetries can converge to a solution of the same equation but in a different geometry, or even to a solution of an entirely different equation.<br/><br/>The partial differential equations to be investigated in this project arise as effective models in various areas of physics, such as models for waves in shallow water, laser light in Kerr media, Bose-Einstein gases in a trap, and superconductors. While they are oversimplified models for engineering purposes, the study of these examples allows one to focus on the new phenomenology that arises when symmetries are broken. Stability of results under such perturbations is essential to make a meaningful connection to real-world systems; indeed, engineering limitations mean that real-world systems never have perfect symmetry. Conversely, failure of stability implies that computer simulations cannot be relied upon to accurately predict experimental phenomena."

Motion of electrons in such crystals is defined by so called transport properties of  the  Schroedinger equation. Transport properties are based on spectral properties.  Thus,  the study of the spectral and transport properties of the Schroedinger equation leads to understanding of the mechanism of electrical conductivity in aperiodic crystals.  A phenomenon of the metal-insulator transition is particularly important for applications. The metal-insulator transition means that at near zero temperatures a material abruptly changes its properties from an electrical conductor to insulator, when an external parameter, controlling electrons energy inside the solid, passes certain critical value. Metal-insulator transition can be described mathematically in terms of spectral  and transport properties of the corresponding Schroedinger equation. The insulator corresponds to localized eigenfunctions (localization) at low energies, while the conductor corresponds to non-localized eigenfunctions extended states at higher energies.  Conductors and insulators also correspond to different types of transport. The goal of the project is to describe extended states in the high energy region for multidimensional almost-periodic Schroedinger operators and to investigate ballistic transport in this region. Ballistic transport means that electrons can move almost freely forming an electric current . Because of the lack of periodicity the usual ""periodic"" techniques for the study of this operator no longer work, and new techniques have to be developed. The PI will develop a new modification  (Multiscale Analysis in the Space of Momenta) of Kolmogorov-Arnold-Mozer method to solve the problem.<br/><br/>There is a huge variety of solids in nature and they have different physical properties: electrical and heat conductivities, elastic coefficients, etc. This variety of properties can be explained by inner structure of solids: first, by types of atoms constituting a solid, and, second, very important, by the arrangement of atoms in a solid. For example, both diamond and graphite are built from the same atoms of carbon, and their completely different properties are due to different arrangements of atoms. A profound problem in Solid State Physics is to explain the connections between micro structures of solids and their macro properties. In our days, with the development of  new industries, which are able to produce materials with prescribed nanoscale or/and atomic structures,  understanding fundamental connections between inner structures and macro properties  becomes more important than ever, since it  gives opportunities for industries to produce more materials with desired properties. For a long time all materials studied consisted of periodic arrays of atoms or were amorphous. However, in the last decades a new class of solid state matter, called aperiodic crystals, has been found. An aperiodic crystal is a long range ordered structure, but without strict lattice periodicity. It is found in a wide range of materials: organic and anorganic compounds, minerals, metallic alloys and some proteins. It turns out such materials have properties which are quite different from those of crystals and amorphous substances. They have a huge potential for applications."

By suggesting an analytic approach, they find criterions for the embeddability of CR manifolds into the model manifolds and associate the CR transversality of the map with the geometry of the CR manifolds.  Zhang will continue to explore effective methods to study the CR transversality and the finite jet determination in their full generality.

In particular, the principal investigator will study the effect that spacetime expansion has on the global behavior of fluids. A primary goal is to understand the minimal expansion rate that is capable of suppressing the formation of shocks in solutions that are launched by small, smooth initial data. A related secondary goal is to find conditions on smooth initial data that guarantee the evolutionary formation of shocks. In a broader context, this work will advance our understanding of the global behavior of solutions to quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs on expanding Lorentzian manifolds. Attacking these problems requires the development and application of mathematical techniques lying at the interface of geometry, analysis, and fluid mechanics. Specifically, the principal investigator will use geometric energy methods to derive dissipative and dispersive estimates for solutions to hyperbolic PDEs.<br/><br/>The projects in this proposal are expected to help provide rigorous mathematical justification for some of the most fundamental predictions of cosmology, many of which are based on the behavior of explicit solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; in cosmology, much of the ""normal matter"" content of the universe is assumed to be effectively modeled by a fluid. It is especially important to understand the effect that spacetime expansion has on the behavior of fluids, for experimental observations indicate that our own universe is undergoing accelerated expansion. Although the physical picture of the fluid behavior set forth by the standard cosmological model is by now well-established, a full mathematical justification of its predictions has yet to emerge. In particular, in order for the explicit fluid solutions to have predictive value, it is essential to show that they are globally stable under small perturbations of their initial conditions; this is one of the major proposal goals. On the other hand, the principal investigator's investigation of shock formation may expose some limitations of the fluid model in cosmology. In addition to conducting research, the principal investigator will also supervise undergraduate research projects connected to the main themes of this proposal."

This question is fundamental and its resolution would have profound ramifications on our understanding of operator algebras and operator spaces. One important goal is to seek a group lacking certain analogous approximation properties (i.e., a non-sofic group), both as it's own goal and as a guide for particular von Neumann algebras to investigate vis-a-vis Connes' embedding problem. In other directions, the investigator proposes to use the ""practical Schubert calculus"" to learn more about finite von Neumann algebras, and to study certain natural questions in finite von Neumann algebras, such as the single commutator question and the Schur-Horn question, using diverse methods.<br/><br/>Group theory is the study of fundamental symmetries that are found in nearly all branches of mathematics and natural sciences. On the other hand, von Neumann algebras were invented in the 1930's and 1940's by Murray and von Neumann; they consist of operators on infinite dimensional space and are related to the formalism of quantum mechanics, which motivated their invention. In modern mathematics, the study of these von Neumann algebras has important connections to several other areas of mathematics, such as group theory and dynamical systems. The investigator will try to answer related, fundamental problems in group theory and von Neumann algebras, namely, ""can certain infinite objects always be approximated by finite ones?"" Answers to these questions would have broad impact;  they are related to many other open problems about groups and, respectively, operators on infinite dimensional space. The investigator will also study certain other natural questions about von Neumann algebras. The research effort will furthermore support the educational efforts of the principal investigator: most directly in teaching graduate students the prerequisites to understanding current research problems and then to guide them to vital and important research problems and but also in educating undergraduate students in a way that shows the utility and beauty of mathematics and teaches them essential mathematical skills and methods of mathematical (and logical) reasoning."

The sources and the target lie in different materials having different refractive indices, and the surface sought is the interface between the two media. Several models are proposed to describe these phenomena as accurately as possible, taking into account various important factors such us energy loss in internal reflection and distance of the target to the sources. The questions proposed concern existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions for these various models. The surface solutions to these problems satisfy fully nonlinear partial differential equations of Monge-Ampere type involving the output and input intensities and other parameters depending on the model. Such equations appear naturally because the interface surface we seek has the property such that the ratio between the changes of energy sent and received in a small area can be expressed in terms of the input and output intensities.<br/><br/>The research pursued in this project arises naturally in the design of optical devices (e.g., aspherical lenses, mirrors, antennas) that have multiple applications in the construction of many optical and transmission instruments. A large portion of the problems under study have practical interest, for example, in the design of lenses focusing light into a desired targeted destination. The impact of the project lies in the development of a mathematical theory that would render this design more efficient, precise, and easily and quickly adaptable to changing situations. It contains ideas and models that are potentially transformative for  the construction of those devices.  This research is potentially useful for engineering design and manufacturing; in particular, in the design of aspherical lenses for illumination applications where energy optimization is important. In addition, numerical implementation of the mathematical theory developed will be useful in the actual construction of optical devices. The research also blends with recent developments in other areas of mathematics and physics, such as transformation optics and cloaking. The project involves collaborations with scientists in the US and abroad, and it will contribute to the training of graduate students."

The problems considered may be viewed as far reaching extensions of classical recurrence results in dynamics. At the same time, these problems lead to strong applications of ergodic theory to combinatorics, number theory and algebra which are inaccessible, so far, by conventional methods. Some of the polynomial results obtained by the proposers in recent years served as an impetus for further developments in the theory of multiple recurrence. These developments provide better understanding of the phenomenon of multiple recurrence along polynomials and bring new vistas of research to light. Some of these vistas lead to interesting new connections with and applications to the theory of prime numbers and finitary combinatorics. The new problems considered in this proposal reflect entrance of new methods and techniques into the picture. These include the geometric method utilizing dynamical systems on nilmanifolds and methods involving the topological algebra in Stone-Cech compactifications. Not only are most of the familiar results dealing with commutative groups naturally extendible to the nilpotent setup, but also it turns out that nilpotent dynamics allows one to get new information about convergence and recurrence properties of abelian groups of measure preserving transformations. Some of the conjectures formulated in the proposal shed new light on the connections of nilpotent dynamics with important problems of ergodic theory and combinatorics. Another group of conjectures deals with refining of the recurrence results with the help of the topological algebra techniques. Yet another group of conjectures is based on new results and ideas which link together ergodic theory, number theory in function fields of finite characteristics, and combinatorics.<br/><br/>The area of Ergodic Ramsey Theory with its diversity of problems, techniques and applications is an excellent medium for attracting undergraduates to mathematics and graduate students to an area of active research. The problems and conjectures that are posed in this proposal connect diverse areas of mathematics (ergodic theory, combinatorics, algebra, number theory) and contribute to each. For example, in recent years the methods, results and ideas originating in the theory of multiple recurrence (some of which are due to proposers) have brought spectacular advancements in the theory of prime numbers. Another interesting direction of research that have emerged in recent years links together ergodic theory of multiple recurrence with combinatorics in finite fields. These developments have connections with the theoretical computer science. The proposed study aims at better understanding of the regularity of the behavior of dynamical systems sampled at moments of time corresponding to values of polynomial (and more general) functions. While the proposal focuses on applications of this phenomenon in combinatorics and number theory, it may be of interest to a physicist as well."

For example, the project will investigate the smoothness of Lipschitz thin free boundaries and the dimensions of their singular sets, the boundary behavior of  solutions of Monge-Ampere equations with degenerate boundary conditions, and the rigidity of level sets in nonlocal phase transitions.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations are used to describe a large variety of physical phenomena. At the same time, they contribute to the development of different branches of mathematics such as differential geometry, topology, probability, and algebraic geometry. In particular, Monge-Ampere equations occur naturally in the mathematical formulation of optimal transportation problems, many of them within the realm of our daily lives: traffic network planning in cities, internet traffic optimization, blood vessel branching in the human venous system, and meteorological fluid dynamics. Such equations also frequently turn up in other areas of mathematics, like Riemannian or conformal geometry. Nonlocal free boundary and phase transition problems appear in several areas of science, including fluid mechanics, plasma physics, and semiconductor theory. Thin free boundaries are relevant to our understanding of flame propagation and also in the propagation of surfaces of discontinuities.

On the one hand, it is concerned with the study of dispersive nonlinear wave phenomena from a nondeterministic viewpoint. In the last two decades enormous progress has been made in settling questions on existence of solutions to dispersive equations, their long-time behavior, and singularity formation. The thrust of this body of work has focused primarily on deterministic aspects of wave phenomena, where sophisticated tools from nonlinear Fourier analysis, geometry, and analytic number theory have played crucial roles. Yet there remain some fundamental obstacles. A natural approach to overcome them is to consider evolution equations from a nondeterministic point of view and to incorporate into the analysis tools from probability. Some of the issues to be investigated in this project are the role of randomization in the well-posedness  theory, the almost sure (in the sense of probability) global-in-time existence of solutions, the existence and dynamical properties of associated Gibbs measures, and the behavior of statistical ensembles under gauge transformations. On the other hand, the principal investigator will study the existence and long-time dynamics of special types of solutions to certain hyperbolic (or nonelliptic) nonlinear Schrodinger equations and systems. The aim is to develop a rigorous mathematical analysis of models arising in connection with the theory of vortex filaments, ferromagnetism, and current work in nonlinear optics (e.g., examining the evolution of optical pulses in normally dispersive optical media), models that have attracted the attention of the physics community.  <br/><br/>Wave phenomena in physics such as light, sound, and gravity are mathematically modeled using partial differential equations. Nonlinear wave models arise in quantum mechanics, ferromagnetism, vibrating systems, semiconductors, and optical fibers. Dispersive equations model important wave propagation phenomena in nature. Their solutions are waves that spread out in space as time evolves while conserving energy or mass. The best known dispersive equations are the nonlinear Schrodinger equations that govern the motion of quantum particles (e.g., electrons), the macroscopic dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensate, and signals in fiber optics. This project focuses on the rigorous mathematical analysis of  dispersive equations that arise naturally in physics and engineering. The synergy of Fourier analysis, probability, geometry, and analytic number theory provides a well-adapted and powerful toolbox to study the nonlinear effects that allow waves to interact and produce new, modified propagation patterns. The problems that the principal investigator will study are of particular interest in the study of long internal gravity waves in deep stratified fluids, the theory of vortex filaments and aerodynamics, and in current work on nonlinear fiber optics that is of fundamental importance in today's telecommunication systems and internet traffic. The ubiquitous role of mathematics is to lay the foundations through rigorous research for the best predictions,  based on which the technological advances and engineering applications we enjoy every day, can be efficiently enabled. The training of students and junior researchers is an integral part of the project."

Perhaps surprisingly, there are numerous relations between these two fields of study, through Fock space representations, martingale properties of polynomials, stochastic integrals, and special functions. Both fields have also developed numerous generalizations and extensions: operator-valued free probability theory and other non-commutative probability theories on one hand; and on the other, operator-valued orthogonal polynomials, polynomials of matrix argument, polynomials in multiple non-commuting variables, etc. This project will explore, through a series of specific problems, the objects mentioned above, emphasizing the connection between the two fields in the project title. It will also involve applications to other fields, notably random matrices.<br/><br/>It is a fundamental property of matrices that they may not commute. Since the beginning of quantum mechanics, probability theory of non-commuting objects has been an important field of research. In the 1980s, Voiculescu started the investigation of free probability theory, a theory of this type which also has numerous, sometimes spectacular, applications to operator algebras and the theory of random matrices (which itself plays an increasingly important role in physics and signal processing).

The creation of a bridge between findings on algebraic higher-rank actions that rely on analytic tools and the more dynamical approach used for general smooth actions is crucial for an improved understanding of rigidity phenomena. For algebraic higher-rank actions, the project will study connections between cohomological obstructions obtained geometrically and those obtained analytically from the induced action on representations.  Part of the strategy is to work towards answering these questions by focusing on representative examples. The principal investigator's main interest is in actions by groups that have higher rank but that lack rich geometric or algebraic structure (e.g., abelian groups, nilpotent groups, solvable groups).<br/><br/>Persistence of dynamics under perturbations is an old question in science. We completely understand the future and the past only for sufficiently simple systems, which are merely approximations of observed phenomena. Chaotic behavior was initially considered to be a pathology. However, it turns out to be a source of stability. Studies showing that it is a healthy heartbeat that demonstrates the presence of chaos are not surprising, provided that one accepts the fact that nature prefers stability. For systems that fall under the heading ""group actions"" the relation between chaos and stability is  even more dramatic:  weaker chaotic behavior tends to imply stronger stability for the system. Group actions can be thought of as systems with multidimensional time. As such, they are useful models in biology (neural networks), chemistry (quasi-crystals), and computer science (multidimensional data storage). In particular models, chaos appears in different guises. It is a goal of this project to explore conditions under which systems with diverse chaotic behavior preserve their dynamical properties under perturbations. This topic is especially amenable to introducing students to research in the area of dynamical systems. Through the study of simple models, students can develop intuition, learn what the open problems are, and make their own contribution to the actual research by performing specific computations. This is the rationale for the project's outreach component, which is aimed at high-school girls and the goal of which is to introduce mathematical research and insights into academic careers to female students at an early stage in their intellectual development."

In another direction, he will investigate how the completely bounded approximation property behaves with respect to reduced free products, focusing on the analogies with free products and weak amenability for groups. Finally, the project will study how the local linear structure (from an operator space point-of-view) of a C*-algebra controls the algebraic, topological, and representation theoretic properties of a C*-algebra.<br/><br/>Approximation theory is an extremely useful concept in mathematics.

The first part of the project concerns the question of determining the internal properties of a medium by making electromagnetic (EM) measurements at the boundary. Challenging questions include recovering the shape information of electromagnetic inclusions and obstacles from boundary data, full reconstruction of EM parameters for an isotropic medium with incomplete boundary data, and the inverse problem for anisotropic media, where the unique reconstruction is possible only up to a change of variables. Such loss of uniqueness in the latter case leads to the second major topic of the project, namely, transformation-optics-based invisibility. The proposed study covers the regularized approximate electromagnetic cloaking scheme, whose limiting behavior provides important physical and mathematical implications for the singular structure required in an ideal cloaking design. The last part of the proposed project considers thermo-acoustic tomography (TAT), a hybrid medical imaging modality that combines low frequency electromagnetic waves with acoustic waves through the physical ""photo-acoustic' effect. In particular, the principal investigator plans to address the problem of reconstructing the electrical parameters and refractive indices of the medium from the internal absorbed radiation map. <br/><br/>The fundamental task of science is to probe the world around us. The most powerful tool to do this is to use waves (e.g., electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, elastic waves), because waves can interact with different media in nonintrusive ways. Such nonintrusive investigation is greatly appreciated in many areas of science and technology, including medical imaging, geophysics, nondestructive testing, remote sensing, and so on. The fundamental mathematical theory behind such enhancement of ""visibility"" is the main topic of inverse problems, while another aspect is to hide an object from detection by waves, that is, to make it ""invisible."" The proposed project concerns both aspects, visibility and invisibility, for electromagnetic waves. For visibility, the proposer plans to develop mathematical techniques to address some of the challenging questions in inverse problems that will undoubtedly have real world applications in the future. For instance, the thermo-acoustic tomography (TAT) medical imaging modality has the potential to detect breast cancer cells at a much earlier stage than what is currently feasible. The development of mathematical theory of TAT will also shed light on a larger class of inverse problems with internal data such as PAT (photo-acoustic tomography), TE (transient elastography), UMT (ultrasound modulated electrical and optical impedance tomography), as well as other similar hybrid imaging modalities. The simultaneous improvement in contrast and resolution is the subject of intensive mathematical study and also of this project. As for invisibility, the development of ""meta-materials"" that have electromagnetic or acoustic properties not found in nature has inspired the transformation-optics based blueprint of the invisible cloak. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that invisibility is no longer just science fiction. This theoretical study seeks to understand and confront the difficulties under a realistic approximate scheme, which will benefit experimental endeavors. It provides an effective way to bridge the gap between reality and imagination that is still vast for current technology."

The investigations will be rooted in the combinatorial and probabilistic notions of independence and the various dichotomies to which they relate either as a source or as a counterpoint. Both the research and educational components of the program will bridge to several other branches of mathematics including geometric and combinatorial group theory, algebraic topology, convex geometry, and descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical theory of dynamics seeks to establish a rigorous framework for understanding the kinds of behavior that one might observe in a physical system as it evolves in time. In a chaotic system our ability to make predictions about the future state of the system is limited or null, and there are different ways in which this unpredictability can be made mathematically precise, for example via the notion of entropy. These concepts are all tied to the probabilistic notion of independence, which is exhibited in its most basic form by the repeated tossing of a coin. A general system will typically combine both deterministic and indeterministic aspects, often in an intricate way. This project aims to develop new tools for identifying the presence of independence in its various dynamical guises and its effect on associated mathematical structures such as operator algebras. On the practical side, the interest in such an endeavor lies in its significance for the study of problems in information theory involving code transmission and error correction."

The first is to find surface subgroups for certain natural classes of groups: the fundamental group of a negatively curved rank 1 locally symmetric space, or more generally of a closed negatively curved manifold; a hyperbolic group whose Gromov boundary is connected; or the mapping class group of a compact surface. The second project is to count ""virtual immersions"" of a geometrically finite open 3-manifold into a closed hyperbolic 3- or 4-manifold, with an aim toward assembling these virtual immersions into a virtual immersion of a more complex 3-manifold (and inductively counting the number of such immersions). The third project is to develop the theory of degenerate complex structures (with something like measured laminations), and use this theory to prove bounds for renormalization of quadratic-like maps, and to provide a sufficient condition for a finite subdivision rule to be conformally realized, with an eye towards proving the Cannon conjecture. <br/><br/>One of the fundamental jobs of the mathematical researcher is to classify the objects that we have defined. A manifold is a space with some number of dimensions, with no boundaries or edges but which is finite in extent. Examples of two-dimensional manifolds include the surface of the Earth and the surface of an inner tube; the two-dimensional manifolds have been classified since the early twentieth century. Recent results including the work of the proposer have made it possible to classify three-dimensional manifolds as well; this classification is made possible by finding two-dimensional objects within the three-dimensional manifold that divides it in such a way as to elucidate its structure. Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a much deeper understanding of the three-dimensional space that we live in."

In particular, Bernard Shiffman will continue his research on applications of pluripotential theory and the Bergman-Szego kernel to the statistics of random functions of several complex variables and more generally of random sections of positive line bundles on compact complex manifolds.  One of the goals of the research is to refine our understanding of the distributions of zeros and critical points of polynomials, holomorphic sections of ample line bundles, and entire functions.  A fundamental ingredient in the study of random sections is the Bergman-Szego kernel, and this project involves using curvature invariants to describe the off-diagonal asymptotics of this kernel for large powers of the line bundle.  Shiffman will apply the off-diagonal Bergman kernel asymptotics to obtain optimal sup-norms for orthonormal bases of spaces of holomorphic sections of powers of ample line bundles.  He will also continue his investigation of the distribution of random zeros of systems of polynomials, or more generally random sections, in order to obtain central limit theorems for the numbers of zeros in smooth domains as the degree increases.  He will investigate the zeros of random polynomials of increasing degree containing a fixed number of monomial terms.  Shiffman will also study point processes given by critical points of random holomorphic sections.<br/><br/>In the physical sciences it is often necessary to handle disorder, where a certain amount of randomness is inserted into a system.  Random functions can be used to model many systems, such as systems of atoms and molecules and their component particles--protons, neutrons, and electrons.  Quantum mechanics describes these particles by wave functions, which are solutions of Schrodinger's equation.  The zeros and local maxima of wave functions give important information on states of atoms and molecules; the zeros are known in quantum chemistry and physics as nodal lines.  Polynomials in several variables can be used to study systems with several degrees of freedom, and those polynomials of high degree correspond to wave functions for high energy states.  The mathematics of point processes--the spatial and/or time distribution of random occurrences--has been used in many diverse fields such as signal and image processing, quantum mechanics, epidemiology, seismology, astronomy, and economics. This mathematics research project includes the development of geometric methods to study the statistics of point processes arising from mathematical equations with some random input."

In terms of the mathematics, most of these problems consist of classical field equations from physics (e.g., fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, elasticity, kinetic theory) and exhibit at least one of two  important characteristics. First, they  might involve a ""free boundary,"" namely, an unknown submanifold (interface) along which the  field in question has a pointwise constraint (for instance, the temperature across along the interface of a metal might depend on the curvature). These submanifolds have as much physical interest as the other quantities, and their dynamics are strongly coupled to that of the fields. The second characteristic these equations might display is nonlocality, which  arises when particles or ""agents"" interact at large (noninfinitesimal) scales, for example, in the Boltzmann equation or the quasigeostrophic equation. This always leads to equations involving integro-differential operators, such as fractional powers of the Laplacian. The specific models studied in this project present challenging analytical problems that are especially attractive in that they highlight the limits of our understanding of nonlinear partial differential equations. In particular, they pinpoint difficulties such as the following: obtaining useful pointwise bounds for solutions (without using comparison principles, or when equations are supercritical); deriving a priori regularity estimates for equations that are both nonlinear and nonlocal; understanding the physical validity of solutions (well-posedness and breakdown); handling nonlinear effects that dominate diffusion or dispersion (again supercriticality); analyzing multiscales and disordered media (homogenization).<br/><br/>Nonlinear partial differential equations are ubiquitous in the natural sciences, as is well known. For this specific project, the richness of nonlocal equations and free boundary problems cover very diverse natural phenomena, for instance nucleation of phases, surface tension effects in fluids, crystal formation in metallurgy, droplet spreading, ocean-atmosphere interaction, and nonlocal electrostatics. All of these phenomena are relevant to science and engineering, for instance in materials science (composite design, dislocations), nanotechnology (microfluids, droplets), bioengineering (martensite or materials with memory), and biochemistry (nonlocal electrostatics, with great potential in medicine). A sound mathematical understanding of the respective equations would be highly beneficial to the development of these technologies."

A primary focus is on the problem of estimating operators that commute with translation and rotations. It is desirable to prove effective characterizations for the boundedness of such operators in Lebesgue spaces. Such results and the techniques to prove them can be used to investigate regularity properties of the solutions of classical equations in mathematical physics, such as the wave equation, the Schroedinger equation and other dispersive equations. Seeger and his collaborators will also study various questions about the behavior of the Fourier transform on submanifolds of Euclidean space. Such problems are tied to quantitative questions about eigenfunctions of differential operators on compact manifolds. Other projects concern the regularity properties of averaging operators, the boundedness of singular integral operators, generalized Radon transforms, and various pointwise convergence questions related to differentiation problems and Fourier series.<br/><br/>Methods and techniques from Fourier analysis have always found wide applications in understanding physical phenomena in the natural sciences and in engineering.

In addition, LaVictoire and his collaborators hope to apply these methods to obtain new estimates for singular averaging operators with canonical folding relations in nilpotent groups, and also to complete a related project on nonstandard ergodic averages derived from sparse sets in discrete virtually nilpotent groups.

This project looks at various processes that distort a given function (the data) in a geometrically patterned way similar e.g., to a photograph taken with a shaking camera, or to a deep-space image warped by a massive gravitational field. LaVictoire will investigate the important problem of when can the original data be satisfactorily reconstructed from the distorted data; such problems can be studied using recent advances in several areas of harmonic analysis."

Understanding and bounding how simple closed curves on a surface can project to subsurfaces provides tools to construct models for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, classify Weil-Petersson geodesics, and elucidate the fine topological structure in boundaries of deformation spaces. Indeed, the existence and uniqueness of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds gives little information about their geometric features and their connection to topological properties of the manifold.  Through his expansion of the use of the bi-Lipschitz Model Theorem (of the PI with Canary and Minsky), the PI will explore geometric models for arbitrary closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds and connect their structure to combinatorial features of the manifold.  This ongoing project with collaborators Minsky, Namazi and Souto will produce explicit models for Heegaard splittings, and a new weak geometrization for 3-manifolds arising as infinite gluings with bounded combinatorics.  Further, the PI will apply coarse methods in the study of the mapping class group via the curve complex and its associated ""hierarchy paths"" to understand the large scale structure of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmueller space, a fundamental object whose large scale geometry remains mysterious despite many investigations.  Finally, the PI will exhibit further features of the deformation space of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, generalizing our study of the local topology of deformation spaces with Bromberg, Canary, and Minsky, and undertaking generalized studies of central compactness theorems for deformation spaces in the context of the curve complex.<br/><br/>In mathematics, the study of dynamical systems seeks to describe chaotic phenomena in simple terms.  Sometimes dynamical systems can exhibit a kind of rigidity, where a small tweak or perturbation does not affect the long term behavior of the system.  In the context of understanding our own three-dimesnsional universe and what kind of structures three-dimensional spaces can have, structures give rise to these rigid dynamical systems.  The recent work of Grisha Perelman solving the famous Poincare Conjecture has ensured this study applies to virtually all three-dimensional spaces.  When a space is rigid, one can understand it completely via ""coarse"" information, via so-called ""models.""  In a recent result of the PI with R. Canary and Y. Minsky, such models were used to classify all constantly negatively curved, or ""hyperbolic"" three-dimensional spaces of infinite volume that are tame in a certain sense.  The classification result solved a long-standing conjecture of William Thurston, and opened the door to developing a more detailed and complete picture of geometries on manifolds previously considered understood. The groundwork is in place for a fundamental investigation of algebraic and topological properties of all spaces of 3-dimensions and how these properties interrelate."
