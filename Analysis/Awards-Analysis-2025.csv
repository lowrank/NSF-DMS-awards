Unpredictable changes can affect the way fluids mix and move and this work seeks to elucidate these effects by developing new mathematical tools to study how random fluctuations affect fluids.  The principal investigator will also explore how unpredictable changes can lead to chaotic and unstable behavior in fluids, which is important for understanding phenomena like turbulence. This effort will train future scientists to continue this work. Findings will be shared with other researchers and the public. By combining different areas of mathematics, a deeper understanding of how fluids behave will be achieved. This endeavor brings together scientists from different fields to share ideas and work together, potentially leading to new discoveries.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the influence of random fluctuations on mixing properties in fluid models, including advection-diffusion and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The research focuses on the interplay between deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping fluid behavior, examining two interconnected themes: (1) Microlocal approach to mixing by random velocities - by employing the new techniques using pseudodifferential operators, this project aims to develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the influence of random fluctuations on mixing properties in various fluid models, including advection-diffusion and nonlinear PDEs; (2) Lyapunov exponents in Infinite-Dimensional Systems - this project aims to advance techniques for studying Lyapunov exponents in infinite dimensional stochastic systems, particularly developing methods for proving the existence of projective stationary measures and the finiteness of Lyapunov exponents. Expected outcomes include an enhanced understanding of mixing and transport in fluid systems and a characterization of chaos in infinite-dimensional systems. The project also seeks to achieve a proof of exponential lower bounds for advection-diffusion equations in compact domains with quantitative dependence on diffusivity. The results of this research will advance the theoretical understanding of fluid dynamics and potentially generate practical implications for fields such as climate modeling, oceanography, and engineering. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Applied Mathematics and the Analysis programs in the Division of Mathematical Sciences as well as the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems (systems that evolve over time) are ubiquitous mathematical objects that can be used to model real world phenomena such as weather systems, robotics, and the motion of particles. Surfaces are two-dimensional structures that play a fundamental role in mathematics, as well as in other science and engineering disciplines. In particular, the surfaces of interest in this project have deep connections to other areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry, number theory, and mathematical physics. As part of the broader impacts of this project, the PI will aim to expand access to mathematics research by involving undergraduate and graduate students in projects in the PI's research field. The PI will also work with local and national programs that encourage STEM engagement at the K-12 level and the preparation of students for STEM careers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the dynamics and geometry of translation surfaces, dilation surfaces, and their moduli spaces. For translation surfaces, there is a well-established connection between the dynamics of the natural SL(2,R) action on the moduli space of translation surfaces and the dynamics of the straight-line flow on individual translation surfaces. The PI will utilize this connection to study problems about the structure and dynamics of random translation surfaces, as well as to apply these results to number theory. Dilation surfaces are a generalization of translation surfaces and are an emerging area of research that has been attracting increasing attention in the last few years. The PI will continue working on establishing the base theory about the structure of moduli spaces of dilation surfaces, with a view toward developing tools that can be used to better understand properties of random dilation surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop novel analytical frameworks for studying rigidity phenomena in weakly chaotic dynamical systems, advancing both theoretical insights and practical applications. Rigidity in dynamical systems refers to the persistence of certain structures or behaviors under small perturbations. Understanding rigidity in weakly chaotic settings is critical: it can lead to more reliable climate forecasts, safer engineering designs, and new insights into the organization of complex networks.  The project also includes an educational component: graduate mentoring, public seminars, and online tutorials to cultivate the next generation of U.S. researchers in STEM.<br/><br/><br/>This research project is organized in two branches. 1. Higher-rank actions via KAM theory. The project will extend the PI's prior work on smooth rigidity by applying Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) scheme to treat general higher-rank parabolic actions. The aim is to prove persistence of invariant structures under small perturbations, even in the absence of classical uniform hyperbolicity. 2. Smooth conjugacy in rank-one dynamics. The project will address the problem of upgrading weaker equivalences-such as orbit equivalence or topological conjugacy-to full smooth conjugacy when standard obstructions (e.g., periodic orbit constraints or Lyapunov exponent mismatches) vanish.

Due to the inherent complexity of fluid dynamics, many questions about these equations are still open. For example, whether the fluid velocity at a small volume could become uncontrollably large, even when the average fluid motion is mild, remains a central open question. In nature, we often observe coherent structures in fluid flows such as vortices (eddies) generated behind an obstacle in a stream of fluid flow, and vortex rings (such as smoke rings) and vortex columns trailing airplanes. Mathematically, these coherent structures represent large (approximate) solutions to the Euler and Navier Stokes equations. A natural question is how stable these solutions are, and what are the precise dynamics of nearby solutions. The main goal of the project is to address these important questions. Theoretical understanding of the Navier Stokes and Euler equations are useful in precise computations of the solutions and in the design of efficient numerical algorithms, which are essential for many scientific and engineering applications. The project provides training opportunities for graduate students, who will learn to use tools from spectral analysis, Fourier analysis, dynamical systems, nonlinear partial differential equations, and numerical simulations in the study of physically significant problems.<br/><br/>The investigator aims to extend the precise linearized analysis for the Euler equations around shear flows and vortices to more general steady states. The essential new difficulties are the complicated Hamiltonian dynamics associated with the steady velocity field, including the presence of elliptic and hyperbolic critical points, and the genuine two-dimensional nature of the problem. The project develops new and robust methods to treat these difficulties. A second important goal is to establish sharp nonlinear stability results for both the inviscid Euler equations and slightly viscous Navier-Stokes equations around monotonic vortices. Another important goal of the project is to study the regularity of solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations under various symmetry or critical bounds assumptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are anomalies in the behavior of a physical quantity where the norm that is used to measure such quantities breaks up. It may be related to the understanding of turbulence, of black holes, the accumulation of cancer cells in human bodies, or the behavior of neurons in the brain. These phenomena are often described mathematically via a differential equation which involves time and space. Studying the qualitative behavior of the solutions of such equations becomes crucial for understanding the related physical problem and is also essential for computing. The main goal of this project is to study the singular behavior of partial differential equations that is related to physical problems, as discussed above, and also to see how the fundamental shapes of spheres, cones, and cylinders, appear in the singularity formation of these equations. The goal of the studies is to enhance our knowledge of the behavior of solutions near singularities. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>The Ricci flow is a geometric equation that describes the intrinsic change in shape according to its Ricci curvature, a notion of curved space that played a fundamental role in the theory of relativity. G. Perelman, in his seminal 2002 work on the Ricci flow and the resolution of the 100 years old Poincare Conjecture, showed that high curvature regions are modeled on ancient solutions to the flow, that is solutions that have existed for a very long time. He also formed a conjecture regarding the classification of such solutions in three dimensions, under certain natural geometric conditions. During the past several years, the Principal Investigator (PI) and her collaborators resolved this conjecture. However, the higher dimensional problem has remained open since it requires the advancement of new methods. The PI investigates this problem, and work on the related problem of Ricci flow singularities as part of this project. In addition, the PI intends to work on the classification of asymptotically conical ancient solutions and study the analytical behavior of solutions near cylindrical and conical singularities. The interplay between analytical and geometric techniques will be crucial for the resolution of these problems. The project lies at the intersection of several active areas of mathematics, in particular nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry, and classical analysis. Applications to topology, quantum field theory, and the theory of relativity are also explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, by working in the more general framework of self-similar groupoids, it will be possible to generalize shift equivalence and strong shift equivalence to self-similar groups in order to understand these structure-preserving isomorphisms and Morita equivalences in the context of self-similar groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Operator algebras originally served as a robust mathematical framework developed by von Neumann and others to model Heisenberg's approach to quantum mechanics, and their study is a vital part of modern analysis. Enduring interest in this area of research centers largely on its many connections and applications to other mathematical and scientific fields. Operator algebras can be constructed from, and in some cases encode, many important mathematical structures such as symmetries, time-evolving systems, graphs, and number fields. They also play a significant role in areas like quantum computing and condensed-matter physics. A primary focus of this project is on discerning the fine structure of infinite-dimensional operator algebras through approximations by simpler, finite-dimensional models. The project involves mentoring of early-career researchers and students through guided investigations and collaborative learning experiences.<br/> <br/>The research focuses on one of the most important recent results in operator algebras, namely the classification of simple amenable C*-algebras of finite non-commutative covering dimension. Connes' Fields medal-winning work on the structure and classification of amenable von Neumann algebras in the 1970s remains fundamental to modern von Neumann algebra theory, and in the topological setting of C*-algebras, the Elliott classification program was initiated in the 1990s seeking analogous results for simple amenable C*-algebras.

Operator algebras is a vibrant area focusing on important subalgebras of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces. Witnessed by the negative resolution of Connes? embedding problem, there has been a surge of interactions between operator algebras and quantum information theory (mainly surrounding understanding quantum entanglement, quantum channels and nonlocal games). 2. The area of non-commutative (nc) function theory of several complex variables has experienced explosive growth in the past decade. In the one-variable setting, function theory is intimately connected with operator theory. While questions about holomorphic functions of several complex matrices have proven more difficult, recent progress in the area seems promising. This area links to nc probability and nc harmonic analysis. 3. The field of harmonic analysis is a classical branch of analysis that has important applications and connections to a variety of other fields including analysis of PDEs, geometric combinatorics, geometric measure theory, scattering theory, and complex analysis.

Laplacian eigenfunctions are the fundamental modes of vibrations. In music, eigenfunctions are oscillations of a guitar string or vibrations of a drum's membrane. In mathematics, eigenfunctions are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle. Just as in music, one expects different shapes or concentrations to become more apparent as the frequency becomes larger. Thus, in mathematics, it is essential to understand how these changes of shapes or concentrations depend on the high frequency and how the amplitude of vibrations propagates from one region to other regions. These lead to the quantitative studies of solutions of PDE. This project provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach activities aimed at K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>The research objectives of the project focus on the sizes of the level sets such as zero-level sets for different PDE models, quantitative propagation of smallness, and their applications to other subjects. The Principal Investigator (PI) studies the sizes of the level sets of eigenfunctions for second order elliptic equations, higher order elliptic equations, and periodic elliptic homogenization. The studies of eigenfunctions advance the progress of PDE in general. The PI also studies the quantitative Cauchy uniqueness and propagation of smallness for elliptic equations with singular weights on measurable sets of positive measure. These problems are essential in the study of Laplacian eigenfunctions and PDE. The applications of quantitative unique continuation to null controllability for heat equations and energy density in spectral theory are also investigated.

Networks such as social networks or telecommunication networks can naturally be seen as a geometric object by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two nodes in the network as a quantity measuring their proximity. A graph equipped with its shortest path distance is an example of what mathematicians call a metric space. This extremely useful abstract concept generalizes the classical notion of distance and plays a pivotal role in mathematical models for optimization problems in networks. Understanding whether a graph, which is a nonlinear object, can be faithfully represented in a linear space allows one to leverage a wealth of geometric tools to gain insight.

The Kalton program consists in the discovery of metric invariants that capture the geometry of graphs and characterize local and asymptotic properties of Banach spaces. On a conceptual level, the project helps to explain how problems in the Kalton program can be seen as limits of problems in the Ribe program. At the same time, the new probabilistic intuition should provide new approaches to attack long-standing open problems in the Kalton program.

Systems that behave this way can be studied using the mathematical tools of probability theory. These probabilistic descriptions depend on what is called an ""invariant measure"", which represents the likelihood of observing different types of behavior. For example, if a die is rolled repeatedly, one invariant measure might say that all six numbers are equally likely, while another invariant measure might say that in the long run, twice as many sixes will appear as ones. If the die is fair, then the first invariant measure is the one to trust, but if it is unevenly weighted, the second could apply. One goal of the present project is to gain a better understanding of the set of all possible invariant measures for a given system. This is an important part of making valid predictions for systems with chaotic behavior.  Part of this project also involves the training of graduate students and the development of a graduate textbook on ""Ergodic Theory and Hyperbolic Dynamics"".<br/><br/>In more technical terms, dynamical systems with hyperbolic (""chaotic"") behavior can be studied as stochastic processes by equipping them with invariant measures and using the tools of ergodic theory. There are generally many invariant measures; thermodynamic formalism provides tools for identifying the measures that most fully capture the complexity of the system. A wide range of phenomena have been observed in the ergodic theory of hyperbolic systems: some (first-order) primarily concern a single invariant measure, while others (higher-order) involve multiple invariant measures in an essential way. Both types of phenomena have been well-studied for uniformly hyperbolic systems, but beyond uniform hyperbolicity the picture is far from complete. The present project centers on the study of higher-order phenomena beyond uniform hyperbolicity, extending current techniques and developing new ones.<br/><br/>The condition of uniform hyperbolicity is restrictive, and many interesting systems encountered ""in the wild"" involve non-uniform hyperbolicity, the presence of singularities, or both. This includes fundamental examples such as dispersing billiards and Lorenz flow, as well as geometrically significant examples such as geodesic flow on manifolds beyond negative curvature. The PI has developed powerful methods for studying thermodynamic formalism of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, and plans to extend the reach of these methods to give a more complete picture of hyperbolic behavior for a wide range of important systems.<br/><br/>Higher-order phenomena are found in the geometry of the space of equilibrium measures; effective uniqueness results in thermodynamic formalism; connections between thermodynamic formalism and moduli space of hyperbolic systems; ubiquity of adapted and non-adapted measures; and the coexistence of hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic behavior. Progress on such questions would substantially advance our understanding of the mechanisms driving hyperbolicity and the appearance of stochastic behavior in deterministic dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fields are inherently vital research areas, and enjoy fruitful interplay with physics, computer science, and technology.  For instance, mathematicians were inspired by physics to study abstract notions of quantum symmetry, and develop models that were later found to describe the physical properties of certain exotic materials.  Within this broader context of the mathematics of quantum symmetry, this project aims to discover and study novel examples of quantum groups from analytical, algebraic, and topological points of view, including certain classes of examples of interest in condensed matter physics.

The research is motivated by universality, which is the appearance of certain common local statistical behaviors for different systems, and integrability, which is the existence of many conserved quantities in certain nonlinear systems used to describe their behavior over time. The project focuses on commonly studied one-dimensional systems, such as orthogonal polynomials and Schrdinger operators. One focus of this project is the study of spectral properties of large finite truncations of an infinite system, on a microscopic scale. These problems have immediate interpretations in terms of random matrix theory and one-dimensional quantum mechanics; moreover, mathematical methods developed on these systems have the potential to illuminate other mathematical models and physical applications. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>Asymptotic local zero distributions of orthogonal polynomials, as the degree goes to infinity, are described by scaling limits of Christoffel-Darboux kernels. Analogously, local eigenvalue distributions of truncations of some operators are described by scaling limits of corresponding reproducing kernels. A modern approach based on de Branges canonical systems gives optimal results for scaling limits in the fixed measure setting; one goal of this project is to develop this approach in the varying measure setting. Another goal is to describe new scaling behaviors beyond the standard universality classes, where instead of a scaling limit there may be a limit cycle or a one-sided characterization of allowed behavior; this is motivated by almost periodic operators in critical/supercritical regimes and ergodic operators with zero measure spectrum.

The axiomatic development of geometry, which postulates a set of basic assumptions from which all other reasonable conclusions are logically deduced, dates back to ancient Greece. The major focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer postulated. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind. The project will also generate research opportunities at a variety of levels, suitable for work by graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will employ non-Archimedean tools to study a range of problems in analysis and geometry. A through-line to the work is a deep understanding of Berkovich spaces, which are non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. One component of the project involves an attack on the celebrated Yau--Tian--Donaldson conjecture, on an algebro-geometric criterion for the existence of constant scalar curvature metrics. In another project, the PI will use variational and non-Archimedean methods to study the existence of complete Calabi--Yau metrics on affine complex manifolds.  and complex analytic geometry. A third project is centered around the Kontsevich--Soibelman conjecture arising in Mirror Symmetry, on the asymptotic geometry of degenerating families of compact complex Calabi--Yau manifolds.

While semiclassical analysis is well-developed for scalar operators, this project develops new methods for matrix-valued Hamiltonians, essential for describing multi-band and spin-orbit coupled systems in these materials. Another goal is to extend semiclassical methods to problems in quantum information theory and quantum computing, where understanding spectral gaps and asymptotic behavior of Hamiltonians is critical for error correction and algorithm design.

The groundbreaking work of Francis J. Murray and John von Neumann in the 1930s already demonstrated that von Neumann algebras are complex objects with exceptionally rich mathematical structures. Since then, the theory of von Neumann algebras has developed into an independent field, establishing fruitful connections with various branches of mathematics and science. Natural classes of von Neumann algebras arise from a variety of mathematical structures, such as groups of symmetries and their actions. This highlights the close relationship between von Neumann algebras and the mathematical areas of group theory and ergodic theory. The main goal of this project is to advance the connections among these research areas by addressing a range of open problems at their intersection.  The project will also incorporate opportunities for the involvement of graduate students.<br/><br/>In this research project, the principal investigator (PI) aims to obtain new classification and structural results for von Neumann algebras arising from groups and their actions on probability spaces. As a consequence, he will derive several new structural results for equivalence relations associated with group actions. In general, von Neumann algebras do not retain much information about the groups or actions from which they are constructed. However, Popa?s deformation/rigidity theory has revealed that many structural properties of these groups and actions can, in fact, be detected through their associated von Neumann algebras. Building on this foundation, the PI will develop new techniques to investigate this rigidity phenomenon within von Neumann algebras. The project will focus on several key research directions. First, the PI will expand the understanding of rigidity by identifying new classes of groups and actions that can be completely reconstructed from their von Neumann algebras. Second, he will investigate primeness and unique prime factorization for von Neumann algebras arising from actions of higher-rank lattices. Finally, the PI will pursue new rigidity results within the framework of measure equivalence of von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Free probability began as a subfield of the theory of von Neumann algebras, which in turn originated in a series of papers by Murray and von Neumann in the 1930s, as part of an effort to provide mathematical foundations for quantum mechanics.  A key concept in free probability is the notion of free independence, which generalizes the classical notion of independence of random variables, enabling the development of a robust ?noncommutative probability theory? in the setting of von Neumann algebras, where rich mathematical structure emerges from the interactions of objects known as free random variables (owing in part to the fact that their multiplication, like that of matrices of complex numbers, is not commutative).  Methods from free probability are now a cornerstone of the structure theory of certain von Neumann algebras, and have applications to a variety of other fields, including random matrix theory and quantum information theory.  In this project, the PI will study several important open problems on probability distributions of free random variables and explore their applications to random matrix models.  The project integrates research with education and will provide research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, complemented by outreach initiatives to teach and mentor middle school and high school students, with a particular emphasis on supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds.  <br/> <br/>The Brown measure of a free random variable is analogous to the eigenvalue counting measure of a square matrix. It is an extension of spectral measures of normal operators to non-normal operators. This measure encodes a great deal of information and can predict the limiting distributions of non-Hermitian random matrix models. In this project, the PI seeks to develop analytic techniques for computing the Brown measures of a diverse range of free random variables, motivated by operator algebras, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The boundary values of certain operator-valued subordination functions will be explored using tools in complex analysis, operator algebras, and noncommutative analysis. The project will investigate random variables formed through addition, multiplication, or polynomials of free random variables. The new Brown measure results will then be used to analyze limiting laws and the convergence of non-Hermitian random matrix models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plasmas are ubiquitous in astronomy and in geophysical fluids. They are also central to many challenges and opportunities facing the modern world, from neon lamps to fusion reactors. The many scales involved, and the very unstable nature of plasmas represent formidable challenges and require many different levels of description whose precise relationship (when to use one instead of the other, and which to believe if the results disagree) is still poorly understood. Since the Earth spins, all questions involving geofluids, such as weather predictions, necessitate delicate analysis of rotating fluids. One of the throughlines of this project is that, in some special cases, the more complicated settings may actually be better behaved or more stable than one would a priori expect; for example, a fluid in rotation may be more predictable than a fluid (almost) quiescent. Isolating such favorable situations in rotating fluids and plasma physics, and understanding how and why predictions are easier then, is one of the main goals of the project. Some of the problems addressed relate to the interaction between a charged, hot gas and a solid wall bounding it; how, in the absence of boundary, a hot plasma may be stabilized under a reversible phenomenon called ``Landau damping'' or whether a faster spinning Earth would have a simpler weather system. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>This project studies partial differential equations inspired by physics. The first part of the project concerns the description of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to non-collisional kinetic equations.

Extensions to more involved models (e.g. Vlasov-Maxwell), will also be considered. The second part of the project addresses problems related to quasilinear dispersive equations. The PI studies the derivation of the Euler-Poisson system for ions from the two-fluid model in the case of confined domain and also investigates the stability of a constant background at rest for the compressible Euler equations in a rotating environment. These problems are addressed using tools from finite dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical systems, harmonic analysis, atomic spaces, functional analysis and more standard partial differential equations tools like the maximum principle, energy estimates, bilinear estimates and precise dispersion analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insights into these mechanisms promise to push forward mathematical theory in analysis and PDE, improve modeling in physics and engineering (e.g., ocean wave propagation, Bose-Einstein condensates, plasma dynamics), and serve the national interest by enhancing the theoretical foundation of applied scientific disciplines.

The rigorous analysis of certain types of solutions to the governing equations for nematic liquid crystals in either static or dynamic situations can predict the formation and structure of defects in the materials, allow better understandings of turbulence phenomena, and justify both experimental and computational studies by applied scientists. This, in turn, can advance the design and control of optical features in display devices. The sharp phase transition problems in the vectorial valued setting have their origins in applied sciences and have already found important applications in many chemical reaction-diffusion problems and isotropic-nematic transition phenomena in liquid crystal materials.

Is there a way to quantify the constructive and destructive interference produced as waves traveling in different directions interact? One way to answer this question is using Fourier decoupling, a mathematical theory that has recently led to spectacular advances on various longstanding conjectures across diverse areas of mathematics. The PI aims to broaden the scope of Fourier decoupling by extending it to new settings such as alternative ways of measuring cancellation and more general geometric surfaces currently not covered by the known theory. Another goal is to build a unifying framework between Fourier decoupling and the seemingly unrelated mathematical theory of efficient congruencing which will bring new ideas to the areas of Fourier analysis and number theory. Furthermore, the PI plans to apply techniques from Fourier decoupling to the analysis of Boolean functions in computer science, with the goal of deepening our theoretical understanding of areas such as algorithmic learning theory. Finally, the project will involve undergraduate and graduate students in research, the organization of international summer schools, and develop an early-career analysis community across the US advancing both scientific discovery and educational development.<br/><br/><br/>In more detail, the project focuses on advancing Fourier decoupling theory and its applications across harmonic analysis, number theory, and theoretical computer science. Key goals include: (1) interpreting the 2012 Parsell-Prendiville-Wooley argument on translation-dilation invariant systems in decoupling language; (2) developing new mixed norm decoupling inequalities relevant to dispersive partial differential equations and extending known Strichartz estimates; (3) adapting the high-low method to the moment curve setting to derive logarithmic power bounds for decoupling constants, giving potential number theoretic applications; (4) proving new refined decoupling estimates and applying them to problems like the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture; and (5) exploring connections between Euclidean harmonic analysis and Boolean function analysis, especially the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality and the Friedgut-Kalai-Naor Theorem, with implications for learning theory.

First, the investigator will study the recovery of a Lorentzian metric, up to a gauge group of transformations, from measurements of the way light or positive mass particles propagate as observed on a timelike boundary. In cosmology, this means recovery of spacetime from remote observations. It has applications to probing moving media with acoustic waves as well. The measurements could be either arrival times and directions of rays or more generally, the arriving wave itself. The second problem is to recover the underlying Riemannian geometry in a bounded domain, say in three dimensions, from the area of the minimal surfaces attached at various loops on the boundary. This problem arises in relativity, precisely in the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, sometimes called the holographic duality in physics. The stability of the recovery will be studied as well, i.e., not so sensitive to small errors in the data. The third type of problem to be studied is recovery of the nonlinear parameters of media from the way light or sound, etc., propagate. In particular, the investigator will show that one can achieve a two-wave interaction in nonlinear wave propagation, which does not fit within the conventional framework. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be mentored and trained as part of the project.<br/><br/>The project is primarily in the area of inverse problems in Lorentzian geometry, the inverse problem for minimal surfaces, and in nonlinear wave propagation and related inverse problems. More concretely, the investigator studies the recovery of a Lorentzian metric, up to a gauge group of transformations, from measurements of the way light or positive mass particles propagate as observed on a timelike boundary. This is called lens/scattering rigidity. The linearization is a tensorial X-ray transform restricted to lightlike or timelike geodesics. What makes the nonlinear and the linear problems fundamentally different from their Riemannian version is that the linear one loses the ellipticity of the Riemannian case. In particular, stability is lost. A version of this problem when the whole wave is observed, is studied as well using the hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as data. The minimal surfaces inverse problem on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary asks whether one can recover a Riemannian metric from the knowledge of the areas of the minimal surfaces with prescribed boundary intersections (say, 1D loops in 3D). The investigator plans to investigate stability as well. Finally, it will be shown that one can force a two-wave interaction in nonlinear wave propagation.

These motions generate a diverse set of singularities: some are topological ones, for instance created by merging and splitting of water drops, and some involve dendrite-like growth, such as in ice crystals or in aggressive tumor growth, due to scale-dependent instability of the evolution dynamics. The Principal Investigator (PI) aims to analyze basic properties of solutions and clarify the critical scale of instability, to validate or invalidate available models in the literature. The project involves collaboration with students and researchers at all stages. <br/> <br/>The presence of lower-dimensional structure is ubiquitous in the physical literature, either as a boundary of a domain or as a singular part of an evolution. Many problems which are otherwise well-understood face significant challenges when coupled with a moving interface, even in seemingly simple settings. Besides the nonlinearity of the problem, the difficulty lies in the nonlocality of the problem, in the sense that the behavior of solutions depends on the global geometry of the interface. Compared with stationary problems, the aforementioned interface motions face an additional difficulty, due to the presence of the time variable which often is of hyperbolic nature. The project aims to develop general methods to investigate the aforementioned problems and the interesting singularities they feature. The first research direction of the project develops a new perspective on the Stefan problem, in the context of optimal transport and interacting particle systems. This viewpoint was recently introduced by the PI and others to prove global well-posedness of the supercooled Stefan problem, a famously borderline ill-posed problem, in all space dimensions. The project builds on this framework to study geometric properties of the solutions as well as to extend the theory to a broader context. The second direction concerns the motion of liquid droplets on solid surfaces with microscopic defects. The presence of defects results in hysteresis, where there is pinning and de-pinning of the droplets during the motion, due to the microscopic contact angle between the surface and the drop. A simplified model is considered, where the problem is formulated as the homogenization of Bernoulli-type free boundary problems, and the goal is to study the dependence of the large-scale geometry of the droplet on the shape and distribution of the defects. The third research direction is on several types of tumor growth models, where the tumor cell density evolves subject to the maximal density constraint. The density then forms a patch where it reaches its maximal density, yielding a Hele-Shaw type flow with a growth term. Here the goal is to understand the effect of different parameters, such as the diffusion strength of the nutrient or the viscosity of the fluid, by focusing on the stability or the instability property of the patch evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these models have always been central figures of the scientific landscape, there has been dramatic progress on some fundamental mathematical questions in recent years. One of the foundations for the current project is joint work of the Principal Investigator (PI) that constructed solutions for greatly enlarged classes of initial states and showed that such solutions are well-behaved. A second foundation is a new kind of explicit representation of solutions introduced by Gerard and collaborators. In very recent work, the PI has already demonstrated the great potential of combining these approaches. The main thrust of this project is to employ these tools in tackling two families of classical questions about physical systems governed by completely integrable equations. First, the project will seek to elucidate long-time behavior, with particular emphasis on models that describe interfacial waves. The long-time behavior of such waves has resisted traditional techniques in the study of integrable systems. Thus, it provides a most impactful opportunity in which to employ the new methods. The second major avenue of research is in the statistical mechanics of integrable systems. A major premise of this project is that the favorable mathematical structures of integrable systems provide an excellent opportunity to make progress on the foundational questions of the subject. To this end, the PI will develop dynamical theories of integrable systems in thermal equilibrium and begin to probe their ergodic properties.

First, for the Einstein vacuum equation, the Principal Investigator (PI) plans to make direct progress towards the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture for perturbations of the subextremal Kerr black hole spacetimes, based on the recently introduced technique for computing and justifying generic late-time tails. Second, for the Skyrme model, the goal is to prove the asymptotic stability of the equivariant B = 1 Skyrmion, based on the PI's recent work on the asymptotic stability of the 3-dimensional catenoid. Third, for critical semi-linear geometric dispersive equations, the PI plans to attack the Soliton Resolution conjecture along a sequence of times without any symmetry assumptions, based on the PI's work on critical geometric flows. Additionally, the project aims to provide a more precise description of generic dynamics under suitable symmetry assumptions, which goes beyond the Soliton Resolution conjecture. Finally, for the Hall-magnetohydrodynamics equations in plasma physics, the PI plans to utilize the instability mechanism of degenerate dispersion to establish enhanced (or even anomalous) dissipation, based on the PI's work on ill-posedness by the same mechanism in the non-dissipative case.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A classical question, for instance, is concerned with the most efficient way to move resources from one place to another. The mathematical theory addressing this is the theory of optimal transport. It has deep connections to analysis, geometry, and probability, and plays a central role in a wide range of applications, including economics, fluid dynamics, and machine learning. While the existence of optimal transport plans can be established in great generality, the study of their structure and fine properties is more delicate. This is the aim of regularity theory, which analyzes whether solutions are well-behaved or develop singularities. These insights are important for theoretical developments and practical applications. The investigator studies the regularity of optimal transport plans in situations relevant to quantum chemistry and data science. There are also connections to materials science: regularity theory turns out to be related to the mathematical understanding of microstructure in materials such as thin-film ferromagnets and superconductors. Understanding the emergence of complex patterns has been a long-lasting effort by scientists. From the mathematical point of view, proving their existence and formation is an extremely challenging task. This project has a broad educational impact by integrating cutting-edge mathematical ideas into both graduate and undergraduate education. It provides valuable training opportunities for graduate students through direct involvement in research-level mathematics.<br/><br/>The focus of the project is the regularity of optimal transport. This concerns classical as well as multi-marginal optimal transport, which addresses the question of correlating more than two measures in the most efficient way. Until recently, the regularity theory of optimal transport has mostly been based on partial differential equations techniques. However, one can also obtain regularity results for optimal transport plans based on energy estimates, that is, within a fully variational framework; this approach is orthogonal to the classical one based on Monge-Ampre equations and is similar to De Giorgi?s approach to the regularity of minimal surfaces. The investigator develops this variational approach further, in particular in degenerate and singular situations such as optimal transport with Coulomb cost, which is of relevance in electronic density functional theory ? a central tool in the investigation of quantum systems and the development of new quantum technologies. The investigator also explores the regularity of multi-marginal optimal transport and Wasserstein barycenters. A different but closely related research direction concerns the development of a robust mathematical framework to understand and analyze branching phenomena, focusing on the description of branched microstructures in a statistical sense. On the mathematical level, this can be seen as regularity theory in action.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of such systems include planetary motion, weather patterns, and stock markets. Geometry, on the other hand, studies the shape and structure of objects. Ergodic geometry combines these perspectives, using tools from dynamical systems to address geometric problems. For instance, the shape of an object can influence the complexity of certain dynamical systems occurring on that object.  This project aims to deepen our understanding of the relationship between an object?s shape and key dynamical quantities associated with it, such as entropic quantities, which serve as indices of complexity.

Here, the notion of ?distance? is varied and hence highly expressive: It can include familiar settings such as the 3-dimensional world in which we live and the geometry of curved surfaces, and it covers important notions of proximity within, for examples, social networks, collections of proteins or images, the Internet, and many more; such geometries typically reside in high dimensions and seem nonintuitive or strange in comparison to our Euclidean surroundings. A paradigm that has proven to be ubiquitously powerful and useful to a rich variety of pure and applied investigations is embedding a geometric space of interest into a ?nicer? space in which one knows how to perform important tasks (e.g., discovering clusters, efficient storage, compression and optimization, and many more). Typically, this goal cannot be achieved without distorting distances, so the pertinent issue is determining the rate of growth of the smallest possible distortion. This is the overarching theme of the project, which is devoted to resolving central issues and longstanding mysteries of the field. For example, it is not even known how much distances must be distorted, in terms of the total number of objects, when one wishes to represent them in the 3-dimesnional space in which we reside. As another example, while famous and very important work in the 1980s and 1990s determined the largest possible rate of growth of the distortion required to embed a finite metric into Euclidean space (without restricting the target dimension as done above), it remains a longstanding conundrum whether this worst-case scenario can occur when the collection that we wish to embed is a subset of a classical space of vectors (e.g. when distances are measured in terms of the sum of powers of the differences of coordinates, or collections of matrices with natural notions of distance such as the so-called nuclear norm, which occurs in settings ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and signal processing). When the distortion is shown to grow slowly, as it often does (this entails devising a meaningful geometric embedding), the project harnesses it to devise efficient algorithms for a range of scientific tasks. On the flip side, demonstrating that there is no embedding with small distortion entails obtaining insights and devising tools that are useful and interesting in their own right (e.g., meaningful ways to decompose geometries). The project is devoted to addressing specific open questions in the above directions, as well as deriving unforeseen applications and developing overarching methodologies. The project will include a major effort to train and mentor graduate students and early career researchers through the PI?s advising role and his leadership roles in the mathematics research community. <br/><br/>It is common in analysis and geometry that solutions to natural questions about representing objects using other simpler objects cannot be done without incurring large errors. For example, Bourgain?s famous embedding theorem states that any finite metric space can be embedded into a Hilbert space with bi-Lipschitz distortion of order the logarithm of the number of points, and subsequent work showed that this cannot be improved. However, if the given metric space is a subset of a classical space such as a Lebesgue space, a Schatten-von Neumann trace class, or a subset of a discrete group such as the Heisenberg group or the lamplighter group, can one say anything about its embeddability properties other than merely that it is a metric space? It also remains a longstanding open question to determine the growth rate of the largest possible distortion that is required to embed a finite metric space of a given size in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. As a final example, suppose that we are given a 1-Lipschitz mapping from a subset of a finite dimensional normed space to a Banach and we wish to extend it to a Lipschitz function that is defined on the entire ambient space and whose Lipschitz constant is as small as possible: How must this Lipschitz constant grow with the dimension? This is open even for Euclidean space. The project studies the above questions, and many more along those lines. When low distortion is possible, it yields structural insights that are impactful elsewhere, including algorithm design; such applications are pursued in this project after embedding theorems are proved. The project also studies impossibility results showing that large distortion must be incurred; this involves developing new geometric structural insights and tools in harmonic analysis, probability, isoperimetry, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to stimulate innovations in quantum technology by unlocking a deeper understanding of how electrons behave in these materials. The project investigates how stable currents emerge between topologically distinct phases; compute their profile and their speed; and derive effective equations for their propagation. The educational component of this project seeks to inspire students by emphasizing the vital role of mathematical skills in today's professional landscape. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to organize a monthly talk series, ""Y Math?"", which features industry leaders showcasing how mathematics drives innovation across diverse fields. <br/><br/>The first research track of this project focuses on topological insulators, materials whose Hamiltonians have a spectral gap and a topologically non-trivial Fermi projector. For straight interfaces, the bulk-edge correspondence predicts that the conductance along an interface between insulating phases of matter is equal to the Hall conductance jump across the interface. The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference. The PI also intends to compute high-frequency corrections to the bulk-edge correspondence in the continuum - where this principle is sometimes violated. The second research track of the project focuses on Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional crystals with conical intersections in their band structure. Despite an extensive physics literature, there is no known example of Schrdinger operator with Weyl points. The PI plans to show that Weyl points nonetheless appear generically in the band spectrum of Schrdinger operators in three dimensions and produce explicit examples as parity-breaking perturbations of face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals. By studying resolvent expansions for adiabatic modulations of these crystals, the PI plans to show that interfaces support topologically protected surface states: three-dimensional analogues of the robust edge states emerging between two-dimensional topological phases.

In many examples, we know the complete spectrum of an operator with one set of boundary conditions, while the physical behavior of the same system with other boundary conditions is hard or impossible to compute directly. Perturbation theory will be developed to allow access to the spectral information to a wide class of operators under changing boundary conditions, even though this behavior is often quite unstable. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and engage the PI in conference organization; outcomes of the project will be disseminated widely through research articles and conference presentations.<br/><br/>More specifically, the two parts of this project?s intellectual merit are trace class perturbations of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space, and Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk. The first part concerns the singular spectrum under infinite rank perturbations such as trace class perturbations and beyond. Of particular interest is the development of an Aronszajn-Donoghue-type theory. The proposed methods fall within function theoretic operator theory, but touch to varying degrees harmonic analysis, measure and spectral theory, as well as abstract perturbation theory. In the second part, although Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk was established ?only? in 2020, it has become evident that it harbors a rich theory and is rather distinct from the one-variable setting. To date, investigations for the polydisk are lacking the connection with unitary perturbations, and therefore also to spectral theory and applications. Seeking remedy and providing a systematic study of the field are the main goals. Inspiration is drawn from classical Aleksandrov-Clark theory, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and analytic function theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geometries arise naturally in many areas, including several complex variables (SCV), partial differential equations (PDE), and algebraic, complex, and differential geometry. This research project by the Principal Investigator is centered around a particular geometry - CR geometry - that arises in the study of SCV and complex geometry. It has deep and profound connections to central topics in mathematical and theoretical physics, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, as well as applications in systems engineering and control theory. The study of obstruction flatness, e.g., which has a prominent role in this project, has a direct link, via the Lorentzian Fefferman space, to the equations of motion in conformal gravity. The ideas and techniques that are needed for the investigations in this project come from a broad range of mathematical areas: complex analysis/geometry, PDE, and differential geometry; and, at the same time, the techniques and tools developed in this project will benefit these areas as well.  The project will also provide interesting research topics and learning experiences for graduate students and postdocs. The seminar activity that will result from the project should be inspiring and stimulating for both students and other researchers.<br/><br/>The goal of this mathematics research project is to study geometric and analytic aspects of invariant metrics and their potentials in complex analytic spaces, and related invariants in CR structures. The PI will investigate questions that are motivated by the classical and generalized Cheng-Yau and Ramadanov Conjectures concerning the Bergman metric and Bergman kernel, respectively, in strictly pseudoconvex domains in complex analytic spaces. He intends to work on the Cheng-Yau Conjecture for domains in Stein spaces with isolated singularities. The Ramadanov Conjecture, which asserts that strictly pseudoconvex domains with Bergman log flat boundaries are spherical, has been shown to fail in complex manifolds of dimension at least 3 (but holds true in dimension 2). This opens a compelling classification problem for domains with Bergman log flat boundaries that the PI intends to investigate. He also intends to study the asymptotic boundary behavior of invariant quantities such as the Bergman kernel, Bergman metric, and the Cheng-Yau solution to the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The investigations will elucidate how the boundary geometry influences analysis in complex spaces with boundaries. Additionally, the PI intends to pursue a theory for the Kohn Laplacian in domains on abstract CR manifolds. This is relevant to the local CR embedding problem in dimension 5. He also intends to continue his work on characterizing embeddability of compact CR 3-folds. The PI will investigate consequences of the global vanishing on a compact CR manifold of a higher order local invariant known as the obstruction function. This invariant is the obstruction to smooth extension to the boundary of the Cheng-Yau solution to the complex Monge-Ampere equation. In 3D, this invariant coincides with the trace at the boundary of the log-term in Fefferman's asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel and, hence, this problem is also connected with a strong form of the Ramadanov Conjecture. While the PI has made significant progress on the problem in 3D, it is still open in general. In higher dimensions, this problem is separate from the Ramadanov Conjecture, another problem that the PI intends to pursue. Additionally, he will investigate the relationship between the Bergman metric and the complete Khler-Einstein metric in the setting of Stein spaces with singularities. A particular goal is to settle a generalized Cheng Conjecture in this context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The generalization of a vector is often a function, so operators are frequently modeled as multiplications on spaces of functions.  IWOTA 2025 will consist of several plenary mathematics lectures describing the latest developments in the relevant workshop areas.  These lectures will cover the latest developments in the connections of single and multivariable operator theory with such specific topics as mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning, numerical linear algebra, mathematical system and control theory, harmonic analysis, and spectral theory of both random and non-selfadjoint operators.

One can visualize a Gibbs measure by imagining water waves rippling across a lake on a windy day. The waves are constantly in motion, and yet the overall appearance of the lake's surface remains roughly unchanged over time. This is because, although the system is dynamic, certain statistical properties like the number of waves, average height, and average velocity remain constant. In this way, the surface of the lake is not in equilibrium in the traditional sense, but rather in statistical equilibrium. Beyond water waves, Gibbs measures and their dynamics play a central role in several areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, plasma physics, and Euclidean quantum field theory. In addition to being of physical significance, Gibbs measures and their dynamics pose numerous mathematical challenges. The central mathematical challenge lies in understanding how the randomness introduced by the Gibbs measure evolves under the dynamics. In the setting of water waves described above, for example, one may need to understand the likelihood of a large wave being formed by several smaller waves. This project advances our mathematical understanding of physical phenomena and helps train both undergraduate and graduate students, thereby strengthening the STEM workforce in the United States.<br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators pursue three projects at the interface of partial differential equations and probability theory, which aim to solve major open problems concerning Gibbs measures and their dynamics. In the first project, the PI studies the cubic nonlinear Schrdinger equation in three dimensions and plans to prove the invariance of the corresponding Gibbs measure. This is the first invariance result for a Gibbs measure that is critical with respect to probabilistic scaling. In the second project, the PI studies the well-posedness of the stochastic wave maps equation. Due to the geometric nature of the wave maps equation, this project not only combines techniques from partial differential equations and probability theory, but also differential geometry. In the third project, the PI plans to establish the global well-posedness of the stochastic Yang-Mills-Higgs heat flow in two dimensions. This result can be used to rigorously construct the two-dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs measures, which play a central role in Euclidean quantum field theory. The three research projects described above forge new connections between partial differential equations, probability theory, and differential geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interest of such waves ranges from the large-scale understanding of destructive ""rogue wave"" type solutions, to the small, explaining the structure of the familiar ""herringbone"" or ""crosshatched"" flow seen in narrow fast-moving streams. The interest of the mathematical tools needed to understand them is also broad, extending to the general class of ""relaxation systems"" appearing in a variety of physical applications from plasma dynamics to many-particle systems, in which complex physical systems move toward much simpler equilibrium dynamics under the influence of physical mechanisms. Though these have been widely studied, the treatment of shock discontinuities is still largely undeveloped; the techniques developed in this project are hoped to remove this bottleneck in the general theory. The planned activities have both theoretical and physical components, and involve collaboration with domestic and foreign colleagues, undergraduates, current and former graduate students, and postdocs. This is expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across fields and institutions, and to aid in the training of students and postdocs. It will also aid in the dissemination of results and techniques, which will be further accomplished by frequent presentations.<br/><br/>The project seeks to resolve the outstanding problems of nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of discontinuous inviscid periodic waves and multi-dimensional hydraulic shocks. Objectives are the development of new theoretical tools in order to treat unresolved questions of practical interest in shallow-water flow, extended thermodynamics, and other models involving relaxation. Methods include a blend of finite- and infinite-dimensional dynamical systems tools with specialized techniques coming from the theory of shock waves and hyperbolic conservation laws. The problems investigated as part of the project involve interesting and nonstandard mathematical issues addressing puzzles from physical applications. For example, successful treatment of nonlinear stability of discontinuous periodic waves would represent a major theoretical advance in both shock and modulation theory while resolving long-standing questions on roll wave behavior in shallow water flow/hydraulic engineering. Likewise, the rigorous mathematical description of herringbone patterns and general hyperbolic bifurcation would mark important theoretical advances. The use of variable-coefficient Kreiss symmetrizers/pseudodifferential damping estimates for the treatment of turning points and regularity in multiple dimensions may be particularly consequential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ergodic theory, a subfield of dynamics, focuses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modeling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical physics, number theory and geometry. However, new tools are needed when the group of symmetries is non-amenable which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored. One such tool is the weak local (or Benjamini-Schramm) limit. These limits formalize the asymptotic local behavior of large, possibly random, mathematical objects. This project is concerned with fundamental questions: when do these limits exist (for natural families of low-dimensional geometric objects) and given an infinite mathematical object (such as a manifold or network), can it be identified as the weak local limit of finite objects? <br/><br/>This research project has three main objectives.<br/><br/>1) In recent work with M. Chapman, A. Lubotzky and T. Vidick, the primary investigator (PI) settled the Aldous-Lyons Conjecture in the negative: there exist non-sofic unimodular random graphs. These are random rooted graphs which cannot be approximated by finite graphs in the Benjamini-Schramm sense despite satisfying the Mass Transport Principle. One goal of this project is to find explicit non-sofic unimodular random graphs which are either hyperbolic, the 1-skeleton of a CAT(0) cubical complex, falsify the analog of Gottschalk?s Conjecture regarding cellular automata or which have isomorphic Bernoulli shift spaces with different entropies. These may all be useful in finding non-sofic groups, a long-sought-after goal.<br/><br/>2) In recent work with K. Rafi and H. Vallejos, the PI proved that Masur-Veech random translation surfaces have a weak local (Benjamini-Schramm) limit as genus tends to infinity. The main tool is an elaboration on the surgery techniques of Eskin-Masur-Zorich. The PI intends to build on this by developing multi-parameter Siegel-Veech Theory and proving weak local limits of hyperbolic surfaces decorated with measured laminations, abelian differentials, quasi-Fuchsian embeddings and so on.  The PI will investigate connections between these objects and Gaussian analytic functions, SLE curves, and the Curien-Warner Markovian triangulation. <br/><br/>3) In celebrated work, J. Friedman proved that random d-regular graphs admit an almost maximal spectral gap with high probability as the number of vertices tends to infinity. Recent work of the PI and student A. Embry generalize this to the degree-regular block model (DRBM). A third objective of this project to extend this to generalize the Bordenave-Collins Theorem (proving strong convergence of random permutation representations of free groups) to strong convergence of a related block model version. If successful, this may show that Koopman representations of measure-preserving actions of free groups determine C*-algebras that are matricial field: they can be strongly approximated through maps to finite-dimensional algebras. It should also determine precise spectral properties of this large and varied class of sparse random graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This explosion of geometric data creates an urgent demand for mathematical tools to organize, classify, and analyze these surfaces, much like how search engines categorize webpages. This project focuses on discrete conformal geometry, a powerful mathematical tool for addressing this challenge. Rooted in classical conformal geometry of surfaces, discrete conformal geometry aims to bridge theory and computation.  For instance, the classical uniformization theorem, a cornerstone result in conformal geometry, implies that surfaces such as human faces or the surfaces of brains can be flattened conformally (i.e., angle-preserving) onto a disk.  However, it does not provide a constructive method to compute such a flattening. Discrete conformal geometry seeks to fill this gap by developing mathematical structures and practical algorithms that achieve conformal flattening of surfaces. These algorithms will have wide-ranging applications in shape analysis and comparison, texture mapping and remeshing, surface flattening for visualization and analysis in medical imaging, and many others.<br/> <br/>Over the past two decades, the PI and collaborators have developed a discrete Riemann surface theory for polyhedral surfaces and successfully proved a discrete uniformization theorem for all compact polyhedral surfaces. Extending it to non-compact polyhedral surfaces, especially without any topological assumptions, remains a significant open problem. Recently, the PI and his collaborator, Dr. Yanwen Luo, formulated the discrete uniformization problem for all polyhedral surfaces without any topological constraints. The primary objective of this project is to solve the discrete uniformization problem in full generality. This work lies at the intersection of several mathematical domains, including classical convex geometry (e.g., the Cauchy?Alexandrov rigidity theorem and Alexandrov?s realization theorem), the Weyl problem in hyperbolic 3-space, and complex analysis (e.g., the Schwarz lemma and Liouville?s theorem).

Early work by pioneers of the field during the 1930s and 1940s revealed that von Neumann algebras are highly complex objects exhibiting remarkably rich structural properties. Over time, their study evolved into an independent and vibrant area of mathematics, spurring the development of powerful mathematical theories and uncovering deep connections with other fields such as group theory, dynamical systems, topology, and more recently, model theory. Beyond mathematics, von Neumann algebras have also provided valuable insights in physics (notably statistical mechanics), biology (DNA molecular structure), engineering (cell phone network design), and computer science (including error-correcting codes, quantum information theory, and quantum computing). These algebras naturally arise from simpler mathematical concepts like groups (symmetries) and their actions on spaces, which are extensively studied in geometric group theory and ergodic theory. The project investigates a number of open problems, with the central goal of developing new methods at the intersection of these disciplines to advance the classification of von Neumann algebras arising from such structures. Additionally, the project offers extensive opportunities for graduate student training and career development.<br/><br/>Building on the PI?s prior work, this project will investigate new research avenues in the classification of group and measure space von Neumann algebras, along with their broader applications. The PI will develop innovative techniques that lie at the crossroads of deformation/rigidity theory, group theory, ergodic theory, and continuous model theory to advance several fundamental open problems: (i) identifying new groups and algebraic group structures that are fully determined by the von Neumann and C*-algebraic frameworks, such as property (T) W*- and C*-superrigid groups, including those with infinite centers; (ii) calculating the endomorphism semigroup, the fundamental semigroup, and the Jones index set of property (T) group factors, as well as automorphism groups of reduced group C*-algebras; (iii) constructing new, naturally occurring examples of W*-superrigid actions?an area of mutual interest in orbit equivalence and von Neumann algebras; (iv) investigating tensor product decompositions for factors associated with negatively curved groups and existentially closed factors; and (v) developing new methodologies to distinguish ultrapowers of factors. This work is inherently interdisciplinary, promising significant synergies among geometric group theory, ergodic theory, C*-algebras, model theory, and von Neumann algebras. To foster the professional growth of the PI?s graduate students, the project will continue to support a visiting program that enables students to collaborate with peers at leading institutions, broadening their exposure to diverse research perspectives and expertise.

Tomography concerns the retrieval of information about a geometric object based on limited information arising from its cross-sections or shadows (projections). For example, think of trying to determine the volume of a mountain based on the size of its shadows at different times of the day. Isoperimetric problems arise in geometry and optimization and have been of interest for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Greece. In a modern context, isoperimetric problems can involve studying the regularity of high-dimensional information. In complex data sets, high dimensionality often results in a regularizing effect.  Tomographic and isoperimetric problems have been highly influential in many scientific disciplines, including physics, engineering, and computer science.  Beyond their historical significance and applicability, these problems appeal to a wide audience because they are often intuitively stated and explained, while their solutions are difficult and require sophisticated mathematical techniques.<br/><br/><br/>The principal investigator of this project seeks to address problems arising naturally from geometry and harmonic analysis by employing techniques involving the Fourier transform, Radon transform, and other tools from various mathematical fields. Among these proposed problems are new affine invariant estimates for mixed-Sobolev norms, estimates for Radon and Cosine transforms (each abstractly represents the cross-sections and projections of an object, respectively) and their connections to long-standing problems including the recently resolved Bourgain slicing problem and the Busemann-Petty problems, and the very illusive Petty?s isoperimetric conjecture and Schneider?s difference body conjecture. The principal investigator will also seek interactions between these problems and other mathematical disciplines, including calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and probability theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central problem in this field is the Fourier restriction conjecture, which seeks to understand the minimal amount of cancellation that occurs when a sum of waves is confined to a curved surface. Work on these problems has led to the development of powerful ideas and tools that have proven useful in other areas of mathematics, such as number theory and differential equations. A key objective of this project is to deepen the study of such problems and to develop new mathematical tools and insights to further our understanding of wave behavior. Additionally, this project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) will work on several projects related to the Fourier restriction conjecture. The first part of the project is concerned with weighted L2 estimates and their applications to Lp problems in harmonic analysis. Specific examples include the pointwise convergence problem for the planar Bochner-Riesz means and the Lp behavior of the maximal Schrdinger operator. The PI will explore a range of weight functions motivated by different applications. The second part centers on investigating the Fourier restriction conjecture itself, potentially leveraging the tools developed in the first part. The PI aims to create a new framework for analyzing this conjecture. The third part of the project focuses on identifying and understanding geometric obstructions related to the Fourier restriction conjecture. In particular, the Kakeya maximal conjecture is known to be a major obstruction.

One of its key ideas is to understand a signal through both its time-domain and frequency-domain representations. In theoretical computer science and learning theory, signals often arise in discrete settings with rich structure?for example, as functions on the Hamming cube (i.e., the space of binary strings). Such functions often exhibit low complexity when analyzed through their Fourier expansion or frequency components. Tackling questions in these domains requires a deep understanding of these structured, low-complexity functions, for which Fourier analytic tools have proven useful. As quantum computing rapidly advances, the natural setting shifts from classical bits to qubits, where signals are represented not by functions but by operators that are non-commutative in nature. This introduces new challenges that demand extensions of classical Fourier analysis tools to the quantum setting. Addressing these challenges is the goal of this project. The project will include efforts in training both undergraduate and graduate students through PI?s mentoring role and in serving the research community through organizing conferences and workshops.<br/><br/><br/>This study investigates quantum analogues of low-complexity functions on the Hamming cube, where complexity is measured, for example, by influence, degree, or the number of variables on which a function depends. A central challenge in this context arises when the dimension tends to infinity. Although Fourier analytic tools have proven highly effective for such problems in the classical setting?illustrated by foundational results on Boolean functions by Kahn, Kalai, and Linial, as well as Talagrand, and by dimension-free inequalities originating from the early work of Littlewood, Bohnenblust and Hille?they do not readily extend to the quantum realm due to inherent non-commutativity and the absence of an underlying classical space. The principal investigator will therefore develop tools to address challenges from the high-dimensional regime and non-commutativity, thereby strengthening the connections between harmonic analysis, functional analysis, quantum information theory, and related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Partial differential equations (PDE) are fundamentally important in mathematically oriented scientific fields such as physics and engineering. They are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. Similarly, harmonic analysis, historically developed from Fourier analysis, holds fundamental relevance in science, engineering, and the study of wave phenomena in general, beginning with the idea that a signal is composed of a sum of individual oscillatory components. Naturally, PDE and harmonic analysis go hand in hand, forming a powerful building block of modern mathematical analysis. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of tools and techniques at the confluence of harmonic analysis and PDE, providing solutions to longstanding open problems and permitting progress on multiple fronts. The invited speakers for this event are world-class experts who have been at the forefront of many recent breakthroughs and advances in these areas. Bringing them together offers a great opportunity to actively seek a timely cross-fertilization of ideas. For other conference participants, this provides a distinct chance to confer with and directly learn from experts across various fields. The interdisciplinary research fostered by this conference contributes to efforts to enlarge the nation's science personnel base and is expected to catalyze collaboration between mathematicians working at the confluence of harmonic analysis and PDE. Particular attention is directed to early-career researchers. In addition to providing them with a platform for learning from and interacting with leading experts in these fields, the conference will offer graduate students the opportunity to disseminate their research findings via poster presentations.<br/><br/>During the last decade we have witnessed an accelerated development of techniques rooted in harmonic analysis which have been motivated by problems arising in PDE. As a consequence, new research venues have been created and deep difficult questions come within reach of these methods.

Dispersive/wave equations model wave propagation phenomena which are ubiquitous in nature. They also describe the basic laws of quantum physics, which is one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. This project studies fundamental questions about dispersive and wave equations by introducing ideas from probability theory. The results of the project will advance the mathematical theory of wave turbulence, which has important applications to plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and oceanography, and the analysis of Gibbs measures for Hamiltonian systems, which plays a key role in quantum field theory and statistical physics. Due to its scope and connections to physics and science, the project will also promote interdisciplinary interactions. As part of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) is training junior researchers and contributes to maintaining the diversity in STEM disciplines at University of Southern California.<br/><br/>This award supports work on five research projects (A-E). The first three projects are concerned with the mathematical theory of wave turbulence. In Project A, the PI extends the short kinetic time derivation of wave kinetic equation to longer kinetic times. This is a major step in the development of the theory, as it goes beyond the perturbative regime and will also shed light on the longstanding open problem of the long-time derivation of the Boltzmann equation. In Project B, the PI plans to generalize this derivation to cover the full range of conjectured scaling laws, which is physically well motivated and also leads to new mathematically interesting structures. New significant combinatorial structures and cancellations which are not present in the physics literature are expected to be discovered. Project C considers the wave turbulence problem for water waves, which has been studied since the 1960s by physicists. Mathematically, it is a quasilinear equation and substantial new ideas are required to obtain results similar to the ones available in the semilinear case. The last two projects concern Gibbs and other invariant measures in statistical physics and quantum field theory. Project D concerns the Gibbs measure for the 2D hyperbolic sine-Gordon equation, which is an important model that contains near-critical scenarios. Here, the goal is to further develop the random tensor theory introduced by the PI in earlier work. Project E investigates, through a combination of techniques from probability theory and integrable systems, the invariance of the white noise measure for the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrdinger equation, which is critical but also completely integrable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research in this project focuses on three types of PDEs: reaction-diffusion equations, Hele-Shaw type flows, and chemotaxis systems. These equations capture the evolution of diffusive processes, such as tumor growth, forest fire propagation, chemical diffusion, and crowd motion. The project aims to advance understanding of these equations and their underlying phenomena, with potential societal benefits such as enhanced strategies for managing forest fires and improving understanding of biological processes, including tumor cell behavior. The educational component is a cornerstone of this project, tightly integrated with its research objectives. In collaboration with Auburn University?s outreach programs, the Principal Investigator will engage K-12 students in interactive workshops and science fairs, inspiring curiosity and enthusiasm for science. A key focus of the educational efforts is increasing participation and retention of women and underrepresented groups in mathematics and science. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and early-career researchers through workshops and summer schools directly tied to the research themes. These programs will offer hands-on experiences, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical applications to prepare the next generation of scientists and mathematicians. This project integrates innovative research with impactful education and outreach, strengthening the link between scientific discovery and learning for the benefit of society.<br/><br/><br/>Reaction-diffusion equations are central to modeling phenomena such as front propagation and interface motion in fields like chemical kinetics, combustion, and population genetics. In sufficiently random media, the long-term, large-scale dynamics of these equations are expected to converge to a deterministic propagation process (called stochastic homogenization). While previous research in the area in general dimensions is limited, this proposed research brings new methods and technical tools to study such problems. For example, it will extend several fundamental probability tools that were widely used in PDE problems, including Kingman's subadditive theorem and Azuma's lemma. Furthermore, the methodologies developed here will have applications to other equations. Hele-Shaw flows with source and advection terms are widely used to model tumor growth, where the region occupied by tumor cells corresponds to the positive set of the solution, and the boundary of this region forms the free boundary. The presence of drift and source terms brings significant difficulties and so there are few results in this direction. This project focuses on developing new PDE techniques to address the regularity and the homogenization of the free boundary. The outcomes are expected to provide a deeper understanding of free boundary dynamics and illuminate the effects of stochastic fluctuations on interface motion. Chemotaxis, the directed movement of organisms in response to chemical gradients, is a crucial phenomenon in biology. While chemotaxis models have been extensively studied, most work focuses on bounded domains. This project aims to first establish the global well-posedness of chemotaxis systems on unbounded domains and then investigate the asymptotic spreading properties of solutions, a key characteristic of these systems. These studies will employ tools from various areas of mathematics, including semigroup theory, viscosity solutions and parabolic regularity theory, to explore new aspects of chemotaxis models, with potential contributions to both mathematics and biological sciences.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Noncommutativity played a fundamental role in the foundation of quantum mechanics, leading to the development of the branch of mathematics known as functional analysis. From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry. This project aims to deepen the understanding of noncommutative function theory and consequently augment its connections to related mathematical fields. It will assist in the professional development of early researches and provide an up-to-date list of both solved and unsolved problems in the field of noncommutative function theory.<br/><br/>One of the main goals of this project is to increase the interplay between noncommutative function theory, noncommutative algebra, and operator theory. Recently, theorems and advances have been made in noncommutative algebra through techniques in noncommutative function theory, complex analysis, and operator theory. Objects of interest will be noncommutative rational functions and how their evaluations on matrices and operators reveals algebraic information about the functions and the skew field they generate; there is a strong connection between the injectivity domains of noncommutative rational mappings, the invertibility sets of their Jacobian matrices, and whether the noncommutative rational mapping induces an automorphism of the free skew field. On the other hand, results from noncommutative algebra (such as the realization of a noncommutative rational function) will be used to deepen the understanding of topics in mathematical analysis. Employment of novel ideas from noncommutative algebra and noncommutative function theory will provide new insights into the study of optimal polynomial approximants and related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research deals with the question of whether a given dynamical system has rigidity properties, namely whether different trajectories must display a lot of common patterns. The principal investigator will conduct research on the topic, collaborate with other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and disseminate ideas developed in the project. The principal investigator will also organize seminars and conferences.

These questions can be completely expressed in the precise language of mathematics as conjectures about the behavior of solutions to a set of differential equations known as the Einstein equations, equations first written down in 1915. The project will thus further contribute to the venerable tradition of rigorous mathematics making fundamental statements about the nature of our physical world, a tradition which over the centuries has proven central to advances in science and technology. The subject of black holes and spacetime singularities continues to inspire the popular imagination well beyond the confines of the scientific community, as was apparent most recently in the public reception of the first stunning images of the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to answer fundamental mathematical questions about gravitational collapse in general relativity, including the dynamic formation and stability of rapidly rotating and extremal black holes and the structure and stability of spacetime singularities. The first major objective of the project is to probe the extremal black hole formation threshold, also addressing the full nonlinear stability problem for the subextremal case. The project's second major objective concerns probing the presence and stability of strong, spacelike portions of the singular boundary of black holes arising in gravitational collapse without symmetry. Finally, the project's third major objective aims to prove stability and instability results of vacuum naked singularities, exploring further the problem of critical collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
