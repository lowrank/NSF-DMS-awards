Complex analysis serves as an important tool in numerous applications: It plays a crucial role in physics (e.g., modeling airflow over airfoils and analyzing dispersion relations in optics), engineering (e.g., signal processing and control theory), and computer science (e.g., image processing and quantum computation). The theory of complex analysis in one variable is classical and well understood, but when additional variables are introduced, many mysteries remain. In this project, the investigator will further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. The proposed activities also involve collaboration with and mentoring of junior researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level. <br/><br/>The investigator will study the Gromov hyperbolicity of the Kobayashi metric; regularity properties of biholomorphic mappings between families of domains in complex Euclidean spaces; quantitative versions of the Hartogs? extension theorem and analytic continuation; and proper holomorphic maps between unit balls. These topics involve a range of mathematical fields, including differential geometry, metric geometry, geometric group theory, Lie theory, and dynamical systems. Thus, the project will not only contribute to the field of several complex variables but also strengthen its ties with these other areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We plan to host six plenary speakers and expect about 75 total participants, roughly 60 of whom will be non-local. The funds will be used to cover some transportation and accommodation expenses for some plenary speakers (in particular, the early career mathematicians), as well as graduate students, postdocs, and people without external funding. Contributed talks in parallel sessions will provide a venue for the early career researchers to share their work, form professional networks, and get feedback.<br/><br/>The conference  brings together junior and established researchers in different flavors of analysis. It will foster new collaborations, particularly among experts in adjacent areas of analysis, and feature new developments in the following three areas: 1. Operator algebras is a vibrant area focusing on important subalgebras of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces. Witnessed by the negative resolution of Connes? embedding problem, there has been a surge of interactions between operator algebras and quantum information theory (mainly surrounding understanding quantum entanglement, quantum channels and nonlocal games). 2. The area of non-commutative (nc) function theory of several complex variables has experienced explosive growth in the past decade. In the one-variable setting, function theory is intimately connected with operator theory. While questions about holomorphic functions of several complex matrices have proven more difficult, recent progress in the area seems promising. This area links to nc probability and nc harmonic analysis. 3. The field of harmonic analysis is a classical branch of analysis that has important applications and connections to a variety of other fields including analysis of PDEs, geometric combinatorics, geometric measure theory, scattering theory, and complex analysis. Extensions to topological locally compact groups require Banach algebra/operator algebra theory to develop a theory of nc harmonic analysis.

Is there a way to quantify the constructive and destructive interference produced as waves traveling in different directions interact? One way to answer this question is using Fourier decoupling, a mathematical theory that has recently led to spectacular advances on various longstanding conjectures across diverse areas of mathematics. The PI aims to broaden the scope of Fourier decoupling by extending it to new settings such as alternative ways of measuring cancellation and more general geometric surfaces currently not covered by the known theory. Another goal is to build a unifying framework between Fourier decoupling and the seemingly unrelated mathematical theory of efficient congruencing which will bring new ideas to the areas of Fourier analysis and number theory. Furthermore, the PI plans to apply techniques from Fourier decoupling to the analysis of Boolean functions in computer science, with the goal of deepening our theoretical understanding of areas such as algorithmic learning theory. Finally, the project will involve undergraduate and graduate students in research, the organization of international summer schools, and develop an early-career analysis community across the US advancing both scientific discovery and educational development.<br/><br/><br/>In more detail, the project focuses on advancing Fourier decoupling theory and its applications across harmonic analysis, number theory, and theoretical computer science. Key goals include: (1) interpreting the 2012 Parsell-Prendiville-Wooley argument on translation-dilation invariant systems in decoupling language; (2) developing new mixed norm decoupling inequalities relevant to dispersive partial differential equations and extending known Strichartz estimates; (3) adapting the high-low method to the moment curve setting to derive logarithmic power bounds for decoupling constants, giving potential number theoretic applications; (4) proving new refined decoupling estimates and applying them to problems like the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture; and (5) exploring connections between Euclidean harmonic analysis and Boolean function analysis, especially the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality and the Friedgut-Kalai-Naor Theorem, with implications for learning theory. Expected contributions include sharper bounds in decoupling theory, new decoupling theorems for highly general surfaces, improved maximal function bounds for the Schrödinger equation on the torus, and new analytic tools for use in algorithmic contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By uncovering the mathematical rules that govern the coexistence of order and chaos, the work strengthens the nation?s scientific knowledge base and supports future technological innovation. Findings will be shared widely through public lectures, podcasts, and a forthcoming graduate-level book, ?Dynamics, Rigidity, and Geometry,? making cutting-edge ideas accessible to students, educators, and lifelong learners.<br/><br/>The research tackles three intertwined themes in smooth dynamics:<br/><br/>1.	Stability. Identify mechanisms that keep chaotic or regular behavior intact under small perturbations. A major target is the symplectic C1 ergodic hypothesis, with new perturbation and blender techniques expected to yield density results for stably ergodic symplectomorphisms.<br/><br/>2.	Typicality.

For smooth functions with rapid decay, this decomposition is easy to describe, but for more rough or singular objects, the decomposition is less well-behaved. This project concerns examples of measures with additional algebraic structure. Of particular interest is the case when the measure is concentrated on a small set, such as a surface or a fractal. This project will provide new insights into the relationship between problems in algebraic number theory, problems in fractal geometry, and problems in harmonic analysis. This project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students interested in fractal geometry and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>A common theme in Fourier analysis, analytic number theory, and geometric measure theory is the connection between estimates for oscillatory integrals, estimates for the number of solutions to a Diophantine equation, and the presence of configurations in fractal sets.

In this project the PI seeks to further explore the connections between number theory, Fourier analysis, and fractal geometry by considering a number of new avenues: applying the theory of algebraic number fields to obtain new decoupling estimates, obtaining decoupling estimates for random Cantor sets in the real numbers, showing the optimality of the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger restriction estimate for Orlicz spaces for higher-dimensional analogues of the well-approximable numbers, obtaining Fourier dimension estimates for number field analogues of the badly approximable numbers, obtaining prescribed projection theorems for nonlinear projections in high dimensions, and finding large subsets of Euclidean space avoiding patterns using the landmark pair framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also have deep connections and applications in several areas of mathematics such as analysis, geometry, numerical methods, and the calculus of variations. For example, among the equations investigated in this project, the semigeostrophic equations are used in weather forecasting, while singular affine maximal surface equations and singular Abreu equations are used in the numerical simulations for the monopolist's problem in economics (where the monopolist needs to design the product line together with a price schedule so as to maximize the total profit) and for nonlinear diffusion and crowd-motion models. The project particularly covers various linearized Monge-Ampère equations with drifts where key structural quantities could be possibly extremely large (singular) or extremely small (degenerate), thus rendering them significantly challenging. Despite their important role in applications, these equations are still poorly understood. The project aims at discovering new underlying principles and developing innovative tools to systematically tackle fundamental problems in this area. Their solutions are expected to reveal the interconnectedness of analysis, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, mathematical economics, and complex geometry, thereby stimulating interactions among these areas. The results of this project will be disseminated through publications of mathematical research papers and lecture notes and via presentations at national and international venues. An important educational component of this project includes the mentoring of graduate students and attracting undergraduate students to mathematical research.<br/> <br/>This project, in the field of analysis and partial differential equations (PDE), focuses on the solvability, regularity properties, and asymptotic behavior of singular higher-order linearized Monge-Ampère (LMA) type equations with drifts that arise naturally in complex geometry, meteorology, economics, elasticity, physics, and the calculus of variations with a convexity constraint. The project consists of three main themes. The first one investigates the solvability in higher dimensions of singular affine maximal surface equations and singular Abreu equations with drifts. These are fourth-order equations which can be rewritten as systems of a Monge-Ampère equation and a linearized Monge-Ampère equation. The second theme aims at establishing higher-order derivative estimates for singular LMA equations with certain twisted structures (which allow for changing the solution nature under suitable transformations). The third theme studies the solvability of singular Abreu equations with degenerate boundary data. The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently developed new PDE techniques in the LMA type equations with and without drifts, including new perspectives on perturbing away the potential singularities by combining techniques of both divergence form equations via energy functionals and nondivergence form equations. They are expected to be further developed to successfully attack the problems in this project, thereby bringing fresh insights into the study of nonlinear PDE and providing novel approaches to regularity theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ergodic theory, a branch of dynamical systems, investigates systems that evolve over time, often exhibiting unpredictable and chaotic behaviors. Examples of such systems include planetary motion, weather patterns, and stock markets. Geometry, on the other hand, studies the shape and structure of objects. Ergodic geometry combines these perspectives, using tools from dynamical systems to address geometric problems. For instance, the shape of an object can influence the complexity of certain dynamical systems occurring on that object.  This project aims to deepen our understanding of the relationship between an object?s shape and key dynamical quantities associated with it, such as entropic quantities, which serve as indices of complexity.

Here, the notion of ?distance? is varied and hence highly expressive: It can include familiar settings such as the 3-dimensional world in which we live and the geometry of curved surfaces, and it covers important notions of proximity within, for examples, social networks, collections of proteins or images, the Internet, and many more; such geometries typically reside in high dimensions and seem nonintuitive or strange in comparison to our Euclidean surroundings. A paradigm that has proven to be ubiquitously powerful and useful to a rich variety of pure and applied investigations is embedding a geometric space of interest into a ?nicer? space in which one knows how to perform important tasks (e.g., discovering clusters, efficient storage, compression and optimization, and many more). Typically, this goal cannot be achieved without distorting distances, so the pertinent issue is determining the rate of growth of the smallest possible distortion. This is the overarching theme of the project, which is devoted to resolving central issues and longstanding mysteries of the field. For example, it is not even known how much distances must be distorted, in terms of the total number of objects, when one wishes to represent them in the 3-dimesnional space in which we reside. As another example, while famous and very important work in the 1980s and 1990s determined the largest possible rate of growth of the distortion required to embed a finite metric into Euclidean space (without restricting the target dimension as done above), it remains a longstanding conundrum whether this worst-case scenario can occur when the collection that we wish to embed is a subset of a classical space of vectors (e.g. when distances are measured in terms of the sum of powers of the differences of coordinates, or collections of matrices with natural notions of distance such as the so-called nuclear norm, which occurs in settings ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and signal processing). When the distortion is shown to grow slowly, as it often does (this entails devising a meaningful geometric embedding), the project harnesses it to devise efficient algorithms for a range of scientific tasks. On the flip side, demonstrating that there is no embedding with small distortion entails obtaining insights and devising tools that are useful and interesting in their own right (e.g., meaningful ways to decompose geometries). The project is devoted to addressing specific open questions in the above directions, as well as deriving unforeseen applications and developing overarching methodologies. The project will include a major effort to train and mentor graduate students and early career researchers through the PI?s advising role and his leadership roles in the mathematics research community. <br/><br/>It is common in analysis and geometry that solutions to natural questions about representing objects using other simpler objects cannot be done without incurring large errors. For example, Bourgain?s famous embedding theorem states that any finite metric space can be embedded into a Hilbert space with bi-Lipschitz distortion of order the logarithm of the number of points, and subsequent work showed that this cannot be improved. However, if the given metric space is a subset of a classical space such as a Lebesgue space, a Schatten-von Neumann trace class, or a subset of a discrete group such as the Heisenberg group or the lamplighter group, can one say anything about its embeddability properties other than merely that it is a metric space? It also remains a longstanding open question to determine the growth rate of the largest possible distortion that is required to embed a finite metric space of a given size in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. As a final example, suppose that we are given a 1-Lipschitz mapping from a subset of a finite dimensional normed space to a Banach and we wish to extend it to a Lipschitz function that is defined on the entire ambient space and whose Lipschitz constant is as small as possible: How must this Lipschitz constant grow with the dimension? This is open even for Euclidean space. The project studies the above questions, and many more along those lines. When low distortion is possible, it yields structural insights that are impactful elsewhere, including algorithm design; such applications are pursued in this project after embedding theorems are proved. The project also studies impossibility results showing that large distortion must be incurred; this involves developing new geometric structural insights and tools in harmonic analysis, probability, isoperimetry, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent works indicate a mysterious divide between ?structured? tiling problems, in which the tilings are well behaved, to ?wild? tiling problems, where almost anything can happen. One goal of this project is to develop tools to reveal the tiling mystery and, in turn, apply these tools to study related problems. Along with advancing the project?s research goals, the principal investigator also initiates events to the benefit of the community and contribute to synergistic activities related to the topics of this project, such as mentoring young researchers and organizing seminars, summer schools, conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>This project investigates central structural problems and conjectures in the areas of discrete analysis, additive combinatorics and symbolic dynamics via exploring interrelationships among them and using tools from various mathematical fields. More specifically, the principal investigator continues to develop tools to advance the study of the structure of translational tilings. This includes the study of continuous and discrete translational tilings as well as multi-tilings in low dimensions. She then adapts these tools to study related problems, such as Nivat?s conjecture on the structure of low complexity configurations, colorings of a grid that have a sufficiently low number of different local patterns. In addition, building on her recent work in conjunction with Illiopoulou and Peluse, the principal investigator studies the structure of integer and rational distance sets in Euclidean space.

This project focuses on topological phases of matter, a novel class of materials that conduct electricity along their edges in a way that remains unaffected by defects or noise. This makes them ideal to improve quantum computations - which are notoriously sensitive to noise. This project aims to stimulate innovations in quantum technology by unlocking a deeper understanding of how electrons behave in these materials. The project investigates how stable currents emerge between topologically distinct phases; compute their profile and their speed; and derive effective equations for their propagation. The educational component of this project seeks to inspire students by emphasizing the vital role of mathematical skills in today's professional landscape. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to organize a monthly talk series, ""Y Math?"", which features industry leaders showcasing how mathematics drives innovation across diverse fields. <br/><br/>The first research track of this project focuses on topological insulators, materials whose Hamiltonians have a spectral gap and a topologically non-trivial Fermi projector. For straight interfaces, the bulk-edge correspondence predicts that the conductance along an interface between insulating phases of matter is equal to the Hall conductance jump across the interface. The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference. The PI also intends to compute high-frequency corrections to the bulk-edge correspondence in the continuum - where this principle is sometimes violated. The second research track of the project focuses on Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional crystals with conical intersections in their band structure. Despite an extensive physics literature, there is no known example of Schrödinger operator with Weyl points. The PI plans to show that Weyl points nonetheless appear generically in the band spectrum of Schrödinger operators in three dimensions and produce explicit examples as parity-breaking perturbations of face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals. By studying resolvent expansions for adiabatic modulations of these crystals, the PI plans to show that interfaces support topologically protected surface states: three-dimensional analogues of the robust edge states emerging between two-dimensional topological phases. These projects require tools from spectral theory, multiscale analysis and topology that will serve the mathematical community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discrete mechanisms studied in the project lend themselves to numerical investigations where undergraduate students play an important role, contributing to the wide dissemination of the underlying ideas and training of the next generation of mathematicians. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will study a broad-based approach to Fourier restriction that seeks to unify results in discrete, Euclidean, and Riemannian manifold settings. We begin by proposing a restriction theory-based approach to Fourier uncertainty signal recovery in a discrete setting. The PI will employ variants of Bourgain's Lambda(q) theorem to cover the cases that are currently out of reach. This will lead the PI naturally to the study of annihilating pair inequalities where the ideas in the project lead to results in discrete, continuous, and manifold settings. The PI will engage in a systematic study of the uncertainty principle on Riemannian manifolds where we circle back to the probabilistic bounds that arise in the discrete signal recovery part of the proposal. The uncertainty principle on manifolds leads the PI to study random sampling on manifolds where the strong unique continuation property of the Laplace-Beltrami operator plays the key role. The question of the stability of the proposed sampling result leads the PI to study the smallest singular values of the resulting matrices, which have natural applications to the signal recovery part of the proposal. Finally, the PI will develop a comprehensive approach to the spectral synthesis problem previously studied by Agmon, Agranovsky, Hormander, Narayanan, and others.

This branch of convex geometry is called geometric tomography. An important instance of this theory is x-ray tomography, which has numerous applications in science, medicine and engineering. The PI has developed a new approach to geometric tomography in which the geometric properties of convex bodies are expressed in terms of integral transforms, enabling the use of certain analytical methods to solve geometric problems. In this project, the PI plans to further develop these techniques and apply them to a range of problems at the interface between convex geometry, functional analysis, harmonic analysis and probability. For example, can one find an algebraic equation whose solutions are sections of a given solid? Can one estimate the volume of a solid from data involving areas of certain sets of sections or projections of this solid? Which random variables are stable, i.e. have the property that the sums of several copies of these variables always reproduce the same variable up to a constant? The PI will continue to work with students and early career stage mathematicians, to introduce them to this evolving area of research. <br/><br/>The problems considered in this proposal connect several areas of mathematics - convex geometry, functional analysis and probability. However, the strategy of solution is common for most of the results - the question is translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as a problem from harmonic analysis. The PI plans to consider the lower-dimensional and non-symmetric versions of the Busemann-Petty problem asking whether a convex body with uniformly smaller areas of plane sections necessarily has smaller volume. Another direction is to study comparison problems and lower estimates for the Radon transform associated with volumetric results about convex bodies. The PI plans to study algebraic properties of the Radon transform related to the problem of Arnold, going back to Lemma 28 from Newton's ``Principia."" The problem is to characterize those convex domains whose cut-off area is an algebraic function of the parameters of the cutting plane. A connection with functional analysis is the study of embedding and duality problems.

This explosion of geometric data creates an urgent demand for mathematical tools to organize, classify, and analyze these surfaces, much like how search engines categorize webpages. This project focuses on discrete conformal geometry, a powerful mathematical tool for addressing this challenge. Rooted in classical conformal geometry of surfaces, discrete conformal geometry aims to bridge theory and computation.  For instance, the classical uniformization theorem, a cornerstone result in conformal geometry, implies that surfaces such as human faces or the surfaces of brains can be flattened conformally (i.e., angle-preserving) onto a disk.  However, it does not provide a constructive method to compute such a flattening. Discrete conformal geometry seeks to fill this gap by developing mathematical structures and practical algorithms that achieve conformal flattening of surfaces. These algorithms will have wide-ranging applications in shape analysis and comparison, texture mapping and remeshing, surface flattening for visualization and analysis in medical imaging, and many others.<br/> <br/>Over the past two decades, the PI and collaborators have developed a discrete Riemann surface theory for polyhedral surfaces and successfully proved a discrete uniformization theorem for all compact polyhedral surfaces. Extending it to non-compact polyhedral surfaces, especially without any topological assumptions, remains a significant open problem. Recently, the PI and his collaborator, Dr. Yanwen Luo, formulated the discrete uniformization problem for all polyhedral surfaces without any topological constraints. The primary objective of this project is to solve the discrete uniformization problem in full generality. This work lies at the intersection of several mathematical domains, including classical convex geometry (e.g., the Cauchy?Alexandrov rigidity theorem and Alexandrov?s realization theorem), the Weyl problem in hyperbolic 3-space, and complex analysis (e.g., the Schwarz lemma and Liouville?s theorem).

One can visualize a Gibbs measure by imagining water waves rippling across a lake on a windy day. The waves are constantly in motion, and yet the overall appearance of the lake's surface remains roughly unchanged over time. This is because, although the system is dynamic, certain statistical properties like the number of waves, average height, and average velocity remain constant. In this way, the surface of the lake is not in equilibrium in the traditional sense, but rather in statistical equilibrium. Beyond water waves, Gibbs measures and their dynamics play a central role in several areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, plasma physics, and Euclidean quantum field theory. In addition to being of physical significance, Gibbs measures and their dynamics pose numerous mathematical challenges. The central mathematical challenge lies in understanding how the randomness introduced by the Gibbs measure evolves under the dynamics. In the setting of water waves described above, for example, one may need to understand the likelihood of a large wave being formed by several smaller waves. This project advances our mathematical understanding of physical phenomena and helps train both undergraduate and graduate students, thereby strengthening the STEM workforce in the United States.<br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators pursue three projects at the interface of partial differential equations and probability theory, which aim to solve major open problems concerning Gibbs measures and their dynamics. In the first project, the PI studies the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation in three dimensions and plans to prove the invariance of the corresponding Gibbs measure. This is the first invariance result for a Gibbs measure that is critical with respect to probabilistic scaling. In the second project, the PI studies the well-posedness of the stochastic wave maps equation. Due to the geometric nature of the wave maps equation, this project not only combines techniques from partial differential equations and probability theory, but also differential geometry. In the third project, the PI plans to establish the global well-posedness of the stochastic Yang-Mills-Higgs heat flow in two dimensions. This result can be used to rigorously construct the two-dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs measures, which play a central role in Euclidean quantum field theory.

The interest of such waves ranges from the large-scale understanding of destructive ""rogue wave"" type solutions, to the small, explaining the structure of the familiar ""herringbone"" or ""crosshatched"" flow seen in narrow fast-moving streams. The interest of the mathematical tools needed to understand them is also broad, extending to the general class of ""relaxation systems"" appearing in a variety of physical applications from plasma dynamics to many-particle systems, in which complex physical systems move toward much simpler equilibrium dynamics under the influence of physical mechanisms. Though these have been widely studied, the treatment of shock discontinuities is still largely undeveloped; the techniques developed in this project are hoped to remove this bottleneck in the general theory. The planned activities have both theoretical and physical components, and involve collaboration with domestic and foreign colleagues, undergraduates, current and former graduate students, and postdocs. This is expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across fields and institutions, and to aid in the training of students and postdocs.

Objectives are the development of new theoretical tools in order to treat unresolved questions of practical interest in shallow-water flow, extended thermodynamics, and other models involving relaxation. Methods include a blend of finite- and infinite-dimensional dynamical systems tools with specialized techniques coming from the theory of shock waves and hyperbolic conservation laws. The problems investigated as part of the project involve interesting and nonstandard mathematical issues addressing puzzles from physical applications. For example, successful treatment of nonlinear stability of discontinuous periodic waves would represent a major theoretical advance in both shock and modulation theory while resolving long-standing questions on roll wave behavior in shallow water flow/hydraulic engineering. Likewise, the rigorous mathematical description of herringbone patterns and general hyperbolic bifurcation would mark important theoretical advances.

Ergodic theory, a subfield of dynamics, focuses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modeling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical physics, number theory and geometry. However, new tools are needed when the group of symmetries is non-amenable which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored. One such tool is the weak local (or Benjamini-Schramm) limit. These limits formalize the asymptotic local behavior of large, possibly random, mathematical objects. This project is concerned with fundamental questions: when do these limits exist (for natural families of low-dimensional geometric objects) and given an infinite mathematical object (such as a manifold or network), can it be identified as the weak local limit of finite objects? <br/><br/>This research project has three main objectives.<br/><br/>1) In recent work with M. Chapman, A. Lubotzky and T. Vidick, the primary investigator (PI) settled the Aldous-Lyons Conjecture in the negative: there exist non-sofic unimodular random graphs. These are random rooted graphs which cannot be approximated by finite graphs in the Benjamini-Schramm sense despite satisfying the Mass Transport Principle. One goal of this project is to find explicit non-sofic unimodular random graphs which are either hyperbolic, the 1-skeleton of a CAT(0) cubical complex, falsify the analog of Gottschalk?s Conjecture regarding cellular automata or which have isomorphic Bernoulli shift spaces with different entropies. These may all be useful in finding non-sofic groups, a long-sought-after goal.<br/><br/>2) In recent work with K. Rafi and H. Vallejos, the PI proved that Masur-Veech random translation surfaces have a weak local (Benjamini-Schramm) limit as genus tends to infinity. The main tool is an elaboration on the surgery techniques of Eskin-Masur-Zorich. The PI intends to build on this by developing multi-parameter Siegel-Veech Theory and proving weak local limits of hyperbolic surfaces decorated with measured laminations, abelian differentials, quasi-Fuchsian embeddings and so on.  The PI will investigate connections between these objects and Gaussian analytic functions, SLE curves, and the Curien-Warner Markovian triangulation. <br/><br/>3) In celebrated work, J. Friedman proved that random d-regular graphs admit an almost maximal spectral gap with high probability as the number of vertices tends to infinity. Recent work of the PI and student A. Embry generalize this to the degree-regular block model (DRBM). A third objective of this project to extend this to generalize the Bordenave-Collins Theorem (proving strong convergence of random permutation representations of free groups) to strong convergence of a related block model version. If successful, this may show that Koopman representations of measure-preserving actions of free groups determine C*-algebras that are matricial field: they can be strongly approximated through maps to finite-dimensional algebras. It should also determine precise spectral properties of this large and varied class of sparse random graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of the spectrum is of central importance in understanding the long-term behavior of such systems. In some examples, the spectrum can be interpreted of as the color of light, or the energy range at which a semi-conductor allows electron travel. To obtain differential operators that are self-adjoint, boundary conditions must usually be imposed; think of a vibrating string that is clamped down or otherwise restricted at both ends, or a vibrating drum. In many examples, we know the complete spectrum of an operator with one set of boundary conditions, while the physical behavior of the same system with other boundary conditions is hard or impossible to compute directly. Perturbation theory will be developed to allow access to the spectral information to a wide class of operators under changing boundary conditions, even though this behavior is often quite unstable. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and engage the PI in conference organization; outcomes of the project will be disseminated widely through research articles and conference presentations.<br/><br/>More specifically, the two parts of this project?s intellectual merit are trace class perturbations of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space, and Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk. The first part concerns the singular spectrum under infinite rank perturbations such as trace class perturbations and beyond. Of particular interest is the development of an Aronszajn-Donoghue-type theory. The proposed methods fall within function theoretic operator theory, but touch to varying degrees harmonic analysis, measure and spectral theory, as well as abstract perturbation theory. In the second part, although Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk was established ?only? in 2020, it has become evident that it harbors a rich theory and is rather distinct from the one-variable setting. To date, investigations for the polydisk are lacking the connection with unitary perturbations, and therefore also to spectral theory and applications.

The seminar activity that will result from the project should be inspiring and stimulating for both students and other researchers.<br/><br/>The goal of this mathematics research project is to study geometric and analytic aspects of invariant metrics and their potentials in complex analytic spaces, and related invariants in CR structures. The PI will investigate questions that are motivated by the classical and generalized Cheng-Yau and Ramadanov Conjectures concerning the Bergman metric and Bergman kernel, respectively, in strictly pseudoconvex domains in complex analytic spaces. He intends to work on the Cheng-Yau Conjecture for domains in Stein spaces with isolated singularities. The Ramadanov Conjecture, which asserts that strictly pseudoconvex domains with Bergman log flat boundaries are spherical, has been shown to fail in complex manifolds of dimension at least 3 (but holds true in dimension 2). This opens a compelling classification problem for domains with Bergman log flat boundaries that the PI intends to investigate. He also intends to study the asymptotic boundary behavior of invariant quantities such as the Bergman kernel, Bergman metric, and the Cheng-Yau solution to the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The investigations will elucidate how the boundary geometry influences analysis in complex spaces with boundaries. Additionally, the PI intends to pursue a theory for the Kohn Laplacian in domains on abstract CR manifolds. This is relevant to the local CR embedding problem in dimension 5. He also intends to continue his work on characterizing embeddability of compact CR 3-folds. The PI will investigate consequences of the global vanishing on a compact CR manifold of a higher order local invariant known as the obstruction function. This invariant is the obstruction to smooth extension to the boundary of the Cheng-Yau solution to the complex Monge-Ampere equation. In 3D, this invariant coincides with the trace at the boundary of the log-term in Fefferman's asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel and, hence, this problem is also connected with a strong form of the Ramadanov Conjecture. While the PI has made significant progress on the problem in 3D, it is still open in general. In higher dimensions, this problem is separate from the Ramadanov Conjecture, another problem that the PI intends to pursue. Additionally, he will investigate the relationship between the Bergman metric and the complete Kähler-Einstein metric in the setting of Stein spaces with singularities. A particular goal is to settle a generalized Cheng Conjecture in this context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early work by pioneers of the field during the 1930s and 1940s revealed that von Neumann algebras are highly complex objects exhibiting remarkably rich structural properties. Over time, their study evolved into an independent and vibrant area of mathematics, spurring the development of powerful mathematical theories and uncovering deep connections with other fields such as group theory, dynamical systems, topology, and more recently, model theory. Beyond mathematics, von Neumann algebras have also provided valuable insights in physics (notably statistical mechanics), biology (DNA molecular structure), engineering (cell phone network design), and computer science (including error-correcting codes, quantum information theory, and quantum computing). These algebras naturally arise from simpler mathematical concepts like groups (symmetries) and their actions on spaces, which are extensively studied in geometric group theory and ergodic theory. The project investigates a number of open problems, with the central goal of developing new methods at the intersection of these disciplines to advance the classification of von Neumann algebras arising from such structures. Additionally, the project offers extensive opportunities for graduate student training and career development.<br/><br/>Building on the PI?s prior work, this project will investigate new research avenues in the classification of group and measure space von Neumann algebras, along with their broader applications. The PI will develop innovative techniques that lie at the crossroads of deformation/rigidity theory, group theory, ergodic theory, and continuous model theory to advance several fundamental open problems: (i) identifying new groups and algebraic group structures that are fully determined by the von Neumann and C*-algebraic frameworks, such as property (T) W*- and C*-superrigid groups, including those with infinite centers; (ii) calculating the endomorphism semigroup, the fundamental semigroup, and the Jones index set of property (T) group factors, as well as automorphism groups of reduced group C*-algebras; (iii) constructing new, naturally occurring examples of W*-superrigid actions?an area of mutual interest in orbit equivalence and von Neumann algebras; (iv) investigating tensor product decompositions for factors associated with negatively curved groups and existentially closed factors; and (v) developing new methodologies to distinguish ultrapowers of factors. This work is inherently interdisciplinary, promising significant synergies among geometric group theory, ergodic theory, C*-algebras, model theory, and von Neumann algebras. To foster the professional growth of the PI?s graduate students, the project will continue to support a visiting program that enables students to collaborate with peers at leading institutions, broadening their exposure to diverse research perspectives and expertise. In addition, the PI will continue to promote this field by teaching advanced graduate courses, organizing specialized seminars, and actively disseminating research outcomes through publications, invited talks, and presentations at national and international conferences and research seminars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tomography concerns the retrieval of information about a geometric object based on limited information arising from its cross-sections or shadows (projections). For example, think of trying to determine the volume of a mountain based on the size of its shadows at different times of the day. Isoperimetric problems arise in geometry and optimization and have been of interest for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Greece. In a modern context, isoperimetric problems can involve studying the regularity of high-dimensional information. In complex data sets, high dimensionality often results in a regularizing effect.  Tomographic and isoperimetric problems have been highly influential in many scientific disciplines, including physics, engineering, and computer science.  Beyond their historical significance and applicability, these problems appeal to a wide audience because they are often intuitively stated and explained, while their solutions are difficult and require sophisticated mathematical techniques.<br/><br/><br/>The principal investigator of this project seeks to address problems arising naturally from geometry and harmonic analysis by employing techniques involving the Fourier transform, Radon transform, and other tools from various mathematical fields. Among these proposed problems are new affine invariant estimates for mixed-Sobolev norms, estimates for Radon and Cosine transforms (each abstractly represents the cross-sections and projections of an object, respectively) and their connections to long-standing problems including the recently resolved Bourgain slicing problem and the Busemann-Petty problems, and the very illusive Petty?s isoperimetric conjecture and Schneider?s difference body conjecture.

One of its key ideas is to understand a signal through both its time-domain and frequency-domain representations. In theoretical computer science and learning theory, signals often arise in discrete settings with rich structure?for example, as functions on the Hamming cube (i.e., the space of binary strings). Such functions often exhibit low complexity when analyzed through their Fourier expansion or frequency components. Tackling questions in these domains requires a deep understanding of these structured, low-complexity functions, for which Fourier analytic tools have proven useful. As quantum computing rapidly advances, the natural setting shifts from classical bits to qubits, where signals are represented not by functions but by operators that are non-commutative in nature. This introduces new challenges that demand extensions of classical Fourier analysis tools to the quantum setting. Addressing these challenges is the goal of this project. The project will include efforts in training both undergraduate and graduate students through PI?s mentoring role and in serving the research community through organizing conferences and workshops.<br/><br/><br/>This study investigates quantum analogues of low-complexity functions on the Hamming cube, where complexity is measured, for example, by influence, degree, or the number of variables on which a function depends. A central challenge in this context arises when the dimension tends to infinity. Although Fourier analytic tools have proven highly effective for such problems in the classical setting?illustrated by foundational results on Boolean functions by Kahn, Kalai, and Linial, as well as Talagrand, and by dimension-free inequalities originating from the early work of Littlewood, Bohnenblust and Hille?they do not readily extend to the quantum realm due to inherent non-commutativity and the absence of an underlying classical space. The principal investigator will therefore develop tools to address challenges from the high-dimensional regime and non-commutativity, thereby strengthening the connections between harmonic analysis, functional analysis, quantum information theory, and related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dispersive/wave equations model wave propagation phenomena which are ubiquitous in nature. They also describe the basic laws of quantum physics, which is one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. This project studies fundamental questions about dispersive and wave equations by introducing ideas from probability theory. The results of the project will advance the mathematical theory of wave turbulence, which has important applications to plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and oceanography, and the analysis of Gibbs measures for Hamiltonian systems, which plays a key role in quantum field theory and statistical physics. Due to its scope and connections to physics and science, the project will also promote interdisciplinary interactions. As part of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) is training junior researchers and contributes to maintaining the diversity in STEM disciplines at University of Southern California.<br/><br/>This award supports work on five research projects (A-E). The first three projects are concerned with the mathematical theory of wave turbulence. In Project A, the PI extends the short kinetic time derivation of wave kinetic equation to longer kinetic times. This is a major step in the development of the theory, as it goes beyond the perturbative regime and will also shed light on the longstanding open problem of the long-time derivation of the Boltzmann equation. In Project B, the PI plans to generalize this derivation to cover the full range of conjectured scaling laws, which is physically well motivated and also leads to new mathematically interesting structures. New significant combinatorial structures and cancellations which are not present in the physics literature are expected to be discovered. Project C considers the wave turbulence problem for water waves, which has been studied since the 1960s by physicists. Mathematically, it is a quasilinear equation and substantial new ideas are required to obtain results similar to the ones available in the semilinear case. The last two projects concern Gibbs and other invariant measures in statistical physics and quantum field theory. Project D concerns the Gibbs measure for the 2D hyperbolic sine-Gordon equation, which is an important model that contains near-critical scenarios. Here, the goal is to further develop the random tensor theory introduced by the PI in earlier work. Project E investigates, through a combination of techniques from probability theory and integrable systems, the invariance of the white noise measure for the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which is critical but also completely integrable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research in this project focuses on three types of PDEs: reaction-diffusion equations, Hele-Shaw type flows, and chemotaxis systems. These equations capture the evolution of diffusive processes, such as tumor growth, forest fire propagation, chemical diffusion, and crowd motion. The project aims to advance understanding of these equations and their underlying phenomena, with potential societal benefits such as enhanced strategies for managing forest fires and improving understanding of biological processes, including tumor cell behavior. The educational component is a cornerstone of this project, tightly integrated with its research objectives. In collaboration with Auburn University?s outreach programs, the Principal Investigator will engage K-12 students in interactive workshops and science fairs, inspiring curiosity and enthusiasm for science. A key focus of the educational efforts is increasing participation and retention of women and underrepresented groups in mathematics and science. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and early-career researchers through workshops and summer schools directly tied to the research themes. These programs will offer hands-on experiences, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical applications to prepare the next generation of scientists and mathematicians. This project integrates innovative research with impactful education and outreach, strengthening the link between scientific discovery and learning for the benefit of society.<br/><br/><br/>Reaction-diffusion equations are central to modeling phenomena such as front propagation and interface motion in fields like chemical kinetics, combustion, and population genetics. In sufficiently random media, the long-term, large-scale dynamics of these equations are expected to converge to a deterministic propagation process (called stochastic homogenization). While previous research in the area in general dimensions is limited, this proposed research brings new methods and technical tools to study such problems. For example, it will extend several fundamental probability tools that were widely used in PDE problems, including Kingman's subadditive theorem and Azuma's lemma. Furthermore, the methodologies developed here will have applications to other equations. Hele-Shaw flows with source and advection terms are widely used to model tumor growth, where the region occupied by tumor cells corresponds to the positive set of the solution, and the boundary of this region forms the free boundary. The presence of drift and source terms brings significant difficulties and so there are few results in this direction. This project focuses on developing new PDE techniques to address the regularity and the homogenization of the free boundary. The outcomes are expected to provide a deeper understanding of free boundary dynamics and illuminate the effects of stochastic fluctuations on interface motion. Chemotaxis, the directed movement of organisms in response to chemical gradients, is a crucial phenomenon in biology. While chemotaxis models have been extensively studied, most work focuses on bounded domains. This project aims to first establish the global well-posedness of chemotaxis systems on unbounded domains and then investigate the asymptotic spreading properties of solutions, a key characteristic of these systems. These studies will employ tools from various areas of mathematics, including semigroup theory, viscosity solutions and parabolic regularity theory, to explore new aspects of chemotaxis models, with potential contributions to both mathematics and biological sciences.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Noncommutativity played a fundamental role in the foundation of quantum mechanics, leading to the development of the branch of mathematics known as functional analysis. From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry. This project aims to deepen the understanding of noncommutative function theory and consequently augment its connections to related mathematical fields. It will assist in the professional development of early researches and provide an up-to-date list of both solved and unsolved problems in the field of noncommutative function theory.<br/>             <br/>One of the main goals of this project is to increase the interplay between noncommutative function theory, noncommutative algebra, and operator theory. Recently, theorems and advances have been made in noncommutative algebra through techniques in noncommutative function theory, complex analysis, and operator theory. Objects of interest will be noncommutative rational functions and how their evaluations on matrices and operators reveals algebraic information about the functions and the skew field they generate; there is a strong connection between the injectivity domains of noncommutative rational mappings, the invertibility sets of their Jacobian matrices, and whether the noncommutative rational mapping induces an automorphism of the free skew field. On the other hand, results from noncommutative algebra (such as the realization of a noncommutative rational function) will be used to deepen the understanding of topics in mathematical analysis. Employment of novel ideas from noncommutative algebra and noncommutative function theory will provide new insights into the study of optimal polynomial approximants and related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of dynamical systems has its roots in celestial mechanics and has become an important tool in many other scientific fields. The proposed research deals with the question of whether a given dynamical system has rigidity properties, namely whether different trajectories must display a lot of common patterns. The principal investigator will conduct research on the topic, collaborate with other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and disseminate ideas developed in the project. The principal investigator will also organize seminars and conferences. In particular, the principal investigator will organize a series of research workshops for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will try to determine properties of certain classes of dynamical systems of group theoretical or number theoretical origins. One of such classes are actions on smooth manifolds by higher-rank commutative groups or by lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups. These actions are often expected to have rigidity, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of invariant structures under the action.  Another proposed line of research is the study of some special cases of the Mobius disjointness conjecture. These include certain distal topological systems and other systems whose trajectories have strict patterns in sufficiently long term. The approaches in the proposed research will use ideas from ergodic theory, smooth dynamics, representation theory and number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions can be completely expressed in the precise language of mathematics as conjectures about the behavior of solutions to a set of differential equations known as the Einstein equations, equations first written down in 1915. The project will thus further contribute to the venerable tradition of rigorous mathematics making fundamental statements about the nature of our physical world, a tradition which over the centuries has proven central to advances in science and technology. The subject of black holes and spacetime singularities continues to inspire the popular imagination well beyond the confines of the scientific community, as was apparent most recently in the public reception of the first stunning images of the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to answer fundamental mathematical questions about gravitational collapse in general relativity, including the dynamic formation and stability of rapidly rotating and extremal black holes and the structure and stability of spacetime singularities. The first major objective of the project is to probe the extremal black hole formation threshold, also addressing the full nonlinear stability problem for the subextremal case. The project's second major objective concerns probing the presence and stability of strong, spacelike portions of the singular boundary of black holes arising in gravitational collapse without symmetry. Finally, the project's third major objective aims to prove stability and instability results of vacuum naked singularities, exploring further the problem of critical collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
