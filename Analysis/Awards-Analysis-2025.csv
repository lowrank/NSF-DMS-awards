"2441413","CAREER: Ergodic Geometry Beyond Compactness and Uniform Hyperbolicity","DMS","ANALYSIS PROGRAM","07/01/2025","04/04/2025","Lien-Yung Kao","DC","George Washington University","Continuing Grant","Jan Cameron","06/30/2030","$89,113.00","","lkao@gwu.edu","1918 F ST NW","WASHINGTON","DC","200520042","2029940728","MPS","128100","9251, 1045","$0.00","This project explores questions in ergodic geometry, an interdisciplinary field connecting ergodic theory and geometry. Ergodic theory, a branch of dynamical systems, investigates systems that evolve over time, often exhibiting unpredictable and chaotic behaviors. Examples of such systems include planetary motion, weather patterns, and stock markets. Geometry, on the other hand, studies the shape and structure of objects. Ergodic geometry combines these perspectives, using tools from dynamical systems to address geometric problems. For instance, the shape of an object can influence the complexity of certain dynamical systems occurring on that object.  This project aims to deepen our understanding of the relationship between an object?s shape and key dynamical quantities associated with it, such as entropic quantities, which serve as indices of complexity. In addition to advancing mathematical knowledge, the PI will establish the GW Experimental Mathematics Lab, creating a collaborative and vertically integrated research environment for students at George Washington University. This lab will foster hands-on learning and mentorship, preparing students to engage in cutting-edge mathematical research.<br/><br/>In ergodic geometry, significant milestones have been achieved when the underlying dynamical systems are compact and uniformly hyperbolic. This project aims to extend these findings to geometric systems that are non-compact, nonuniformly hyperbolic, or both, using thermodynamic formalism. The research focuses on three objectives: studying correlations in higher-rank cusped geometric structures through orbital distribution analysis; examining the metric geometry of deformation spaces of these structures via Thurston?s asymmetric metric; and analyzing orbital correlations in nonuniformly hyperbolic geometric structures. Progress in these areas will involve developing new tools in thermodynamic formalism combined with geometric insights, potentially advancing our understanding of the interplay between geometry and dynamics in more general settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study goes back to ancient Greeks and has remained vibrant up to the present day. Recent works indicate a mysterious divide between ?structured? tiling problems, in which the tilings are well behaved, to ?wild? tiling problems, where almost anything can happen. One goal of this project is to develop tools to reveal the tiling mystery and, in turn, apply these tools to study related problems. Along with advancing the project?s research goals, the principal investigator also initiates events to the benefit of the community and contribute to synergistic activities related to the topics of this project, such as mentoring young researchers and organizing seminars, summer schools, conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>This project investigates central structural problems and conjectures in the areas of discrete analysis, additive combinatorics and symbolic dynamics via exploring interrelationships among them and using tools from various mathematical fields. More specifically, the principal investigator continues to develop tools to advance the study of the structure of translational tilings. This includes the study of continuous and discrete translational tilings as well as multi-tilings in low dimensions. She then adapts these tools to study related problems, such as Nivat?s conjecture on the structure of low complexity configurations, colorings of a grid that have a sufficiently low number of different local patterns. In addition, building on her recent work in conjunction with Illiopoulou and Peluse, the principal investigator studies the structure of integer and rational distance sets in Euclidean space. This study is closely related to the celebrated Erdos?Ulam problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on topological phases of matter, a novel class of materials that conduct electricity along their edges in a way that remains unaffected by defects or noise. This makes them ideal to improve quantum computations - which are notoriously sensitive to noise. This project aims to stimulate innovations in quantum technology by unlocking a deeper understanding of how electrons behave in these materials. The project investigates how stable currents emerge between topologically distinct phases; compute their profile and their speed; and derive effective equations for their propagation. The educational component of this project seeks to inspire students by emphasizing the vital role of mathematical skills in today's professional landscape. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to organize a monthly talk series, ""Y Math?"", which features industry leaders showcasing how mathematics drives innovation across diverse fields. <br/><br/>The first research track of this project focuses on topological insulators, materials whose Hamiltonians have a spectral gap and a topologically non-trivial Fermi projector. For straight interfaces, the bulk-edge correspondence predicts that the conductance along an interface between insulating phases of matter is equal to the Hall conductance jump across the interface. The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference. The PI also intends to compute high-frequency corrections to the bulk-edge correspondence in the continuum - where this principle is sometimes violated. The second research track of the project focuses on Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional crystals with conical intersections in their band structure. Despite an extensive physics literature, there is no known example of Schrödinger operator with Weyl points. The PI plans to show that Weyl points nonetheless appear generically in the band spectrum of Schrödinger operators in three dimensions and produce explicit examples as parity-breaking perturbations of face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals. By studying resolvent expansions for adiabatic modulations of these crystals, the PI plans to show that interfaces support topologically protected surface states: three-dimensional analogues of the robust edge states emerging between two-dimensional topological phases. These projects require tools from spectral theory, multiscale analysis and topology that will serve the mathematical community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research in this project focuses on three types of PDEs: reaction-diffusion equations, Hele-Shaw type flows, and chemotaxis systems. These equations capture the evolution of diffusive processes, such as tumor growth, forest fire propagation, chemical diffusion, and crowd motion. The project aims to advance understanding of these equations and their underlying phenomena, with potential societal benefits such as enhanced strategies for managing forest fires and improving understanding of biological processes, including tumor cell behavior. The educational component is a cornerstone of this project, tightly integrated with its research objectives. In collaboration with Auburn University?s outreach programs, the Principal Investigator will engage K-12 students in interactive workshops and science fairs, inspiring curiosity and enthusiasm for science. A key focus of the educational efforts is increasing participation and retention of women and underrepresented groups in mathematics and science. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and early-career researchers through workshops and summer schools directly tied to the research themes. These programs will offer hands-on experiences, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical applications to prepare the next generation of scientists and mathematicians. This project integrates innovative research with impactful education and outreach, strengthening the link between scientific discovery and learning for the benefit of society.<br/><br/><br/>Reaction-diffusion equations are central to modeling phenomena such as front propagation and interface motion in fields like chemical kinetics, combustion, and population genetics. In sufficiently random media, the long-term, large-scale dynamics of these equations are expected to converge to a deterministic propagation process (called stochastic homogenization). While previous research in the area in general dimensions is limited, this proposed research brings new methods and technical tools to study such problems. For example, it will extend several fundamental probability tools that were widely used in PDE problems, including Kingman's subadditive theorem and Azuma's lemma. Furthermore, the methodologies developed here will have applications to other equations. Hele-Shaw flows with source and advection terms are widely used to model tumor growth, where the region occupied by tumor cells corresponds to the positive set of the solution, and the boundary of this region forms the free boundary. The presence of drift and source terms brings significant difficulties and so there are few results in this direction. This project focuses on developing new PDE techniques to address the regularity and the homogenization of the free boundary. The outcomes are expected to provide a deeper understanding of free boundary dynamics and illuminate the effects of stochastic fluctuations on interface motion. Chemotaxis, the directed movement of organisms in response to chemical gradients, is a crucial phenomenon in biology. While chemotaxis models have been extensively studied, most work focuses on bounded domains. This project aims to first establish the global well-posedness of chemotaxis systems on unbounded domains and then investigate the asymptotic spreading properties of solutions, a key characteristic of these systems. These studies will employ tools from various areas of mathematics, including semigroup theory, viscosity solutions and parabolic regularity theory, to explore new aspects of chemotaxis models, with potential contributions to both mathematics and biological sciences.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Noncommutativity played a fundamental role in the foundation of quantum mechanics, leading to the development of the branch of mathematics known as functional analysis. From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry. This project aims to deepen the understanding of noncommutative function theory and consequently augment its connections to related mathematical fields. It will assist in the professional development of early researches and provide an up-to-date list of both solved and unsolved problems in the field of noncommutative function theory.<br/>             <br/>One of the main goals of this project is to increase the interplay between noncommutative function theory, noncommutative algebra, and operator theory. Recently, theorems and advances have been made in noncommutative algebra through techniques in noncommutative function theory, complex analysis, and operator theory. Objects of interest will be noncommutative rational functions and how their evaluations on matrices and operators reveals algebraic information about the functions and the skew field they generate; there is a strong connection between the injectivity domains of noncommutative rational mappings, the invertibility sets of their Jacobian matrices, and whether the noncommutative rational mapping induces an automorphism of the free skew field. On the other hand, results from noncommutative algebra (such as the realization of a noncommutative rational function) will be used to deepen the understanding of topics in mathematical analysis. Employment of novel ideas from noncommutative algebra and noncommutative function theory will provide new insights into the study of optimal polynomial approximants and related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference encourages participation  from a wide range of mathematicians at all career stages and from a variety of backgrounds. In support of this goal of inclusivity, the conference is be available to both in-person and virtual participation. As a result, the 58th STDC will assemble a diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate results and build connections that will lead to future collaboration. Conference funds will be used to support graduate students, early career mathematicians, and those without sufficient institutional support.<br/><br/>The 58th STDC will be the latest in a conference series that began in 1967, and it will continue the conference's tradition of bringing together researchers from various active research areas within topology. This year's conference will include sessions in continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology, geometric group theory, set-theoretic topology, and applied topology. The inclusion of applied topology is a new addition for this year's conference and is intended both to appeal to regular STDC participants while also attracting new mathematicians to the conference.

These questions can be completely expressed in the precise language of mathematics as conjectures about the behavior of solutions to a set of differential equations known as the Einstein equations, equations first written down in 1915. The project will thus further contribute to the venerable tradition of rigorous mathematics making fundamental statements about the nature of our physical world, a tradition which over the centuries has proven central to advances in science and technology. The subject of black holes and spacetime singularities continues to inspire the popular imagination well beyond the confines of the scientific community, as was apparent most recently in the public reception of the first stunning images of the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to answer fundamental mathematical questions about gravitational collapse in general relativity, including the dynamic formation and stability of rapidly rotating and extremal black holes and the structure and stability of spacetime singularities. The first major objective of the project is to probe the extremal black hole formation threshold, also addressing the full nonlinear stability problem for the subextremal case. The project's second major objective concerns probing the presence and stability of strong, spacelike portions of the singular boundary of black holes arising in gravitational collapse without symmetry. Finally, the project's third major objective aims to prove stability and instability results of vacuum naked singularities, exploring further the problem of critical collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
