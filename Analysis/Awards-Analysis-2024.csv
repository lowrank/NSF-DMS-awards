They have since developed into a full area of study as a natural noncommutative notion of measure theory. The noncommutative setting of topology (C*-algebras) emerged shortly after, and the two subjects have historically been closely connected. This project explores these connections to develop new ideas, to reach a broad mathematical community and providing engagement and support for new students in the field.  The investigator is actively participating in the training of students and postdocs in von Neumann algebras and the research from this project will directly impact these students and postdocs. <br/><br/>The project investigator is studying approximation properties (or the lack thereof) in von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, especially relating to group von Neumann algebras and group measure space constructions. This has historically been a significant area of study in the classification of operator algebras, with amenability/injectivity playing a major role in the development of von Neumann algebras, and nuclearity playing a major corresponding role in the theory of C*-algebras. The emergence of Popa's deformation/rigidity theory has led to numerous breakthroughs in the classification of von Neumann algebras beyond the amenability setting, and approximation properties, such as Ozawa's notion of a biexact group, have created new opportunities to study approximation properties in the setting of von Neumann algebras. The research developed in this project investigates these approximation properties, creating new connections between C* and von Neumann algebras. This allows new C*-algebraic tools to be used in the setting of von Neumann algebras, leading to new structural results for group and group measure space von Neumann algebras, and giving a deeper insight into interactions between operator algebras, ergodic theory, and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elliptic differential equations govern the equilibrium configurations of various physical phenomena, for instance, those arising from minimization problems for natural energy functionals. Examples include the shape of free-hanging bridges, the shape of soap bubbles, and the sound of drums. Elliptic differential equations are also used to quantify the degree to which physical objects are bent or distorted, with far-reaching implications and applications in geometry and topology. The proposed research focuses on the regularity of solutions to such equations. Questions to be addressed include the following: Do non-smooth points (singularities) exist? How large can the set of singularities be? What is the behavior of the solution near a singularity? Is it possible to perturb the underlying environment in order to eliminate the singularity? The project will also provide opportunities for the professional development of graduate students, both via individual mentoring and via the organization of a directed learning seminar on geometric analysis and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical objectives of the project are twofold. First, the principal investigator will study unique continuation for solutions to elliptic partial differential equations, with a focus on quantitative estimates on the size and structure of the singular set of these solutions. A second topic for consideration is the regularity theory for generalized minimal submanifolds (a generalized notion of smooth submanifolds which arise as critical points for the area functional under local deformations). In particular, the principal investigator will study branch singular points in the interior as well as at the boundary of a generalized minimal submanifold, under an area-minimizing or stability assumption. Research on the latter topic, which can be viewed as a non-linear analogue of quantitative unique continuation for elliptic equations, requires the integration of ideas from geometric measure theory, partial differential equations and geometric analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They may be used, for example, to study the evolution of a gas or a plasma. The Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in the study of the Boltzmann and Landau equations, for systems of particles that repel each other by power-law potentials. These equations exhibit a regularization effect. An outstanding open problem is to understand if a singularity could emerge from the natural flow of the equation, or if the regularization effects actually dominate the evolution and keep the solutions smooth. The PI mentors graduate students and postdocs in research on the topics of this project.<br/><br/>This project aims at developing tools in the analysis of nonlocal equations, parabolic equations and hypoelliptic theory targeted to their applications in kinetic equations. The Boltzmann collision operator acts as a nonlinear diffusive operator of fractional order. It can be studied in the framework of parabolic integro-differential equations. The Landau equation is a model from statistical mechanics used to describe the dynamics of plasma. It can be obtained as a limit case of the Boltzmann equation when grazing collisions prevail. It is a second order, nonlinear, parabolic equation. The project connects different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, relating recent progress in nonlinear integro-differential equations with the classical Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics. Kinetic equations involve a nonlinear diffusive operator with respect to velocity, combined with a transport equation with respect to space. The regularization effect in all variables requires ideas from hypoelliptic theory. For the Boltzmann equation in the case of very soft potentials, as well as for the Landau equation with Coulomb potentials, the diffusive part of the equations is not strong enough to prevent the solution from blowing up in theory. In that case, new ideas are needed to properly understand the regularization effects of the equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In classical mechanics it is possible to simultaneously observe and measure various properties of a physical system ? for example, the locations and velocities of all of its components. Such properties are often called observables.  Observables be viewed as functions of the underlying system and form an algebra ? they can be added and multiplied.   In quantum mechanics, simultaneous measurements are no longer possible. Mathematically this is reflected by the non-commutativity of the algebra of observables for quantum systems. Nonetheless, many of the operations that can be done with ordinary functions have quantum analogs.  The current proposal studies such non-commutative algebras of observables from the angle of Voiculescu?s free probability theory, which treats observables as random variables. This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations and Brownian motion, amenable to analysis by techniques inspired by classical information theory.  This project will promote human resource development through graduate and undergraduate research opportunities and will support students under the auspices of the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle.  <br/><br/>The proposed research deals with several questions in von Neumann algebras which are approached by free probability and free information methods, including free entropy theory.  This includes further developing PDE based methods in the non-commutative context and strengthening the connection between free probability and random matrix theory.  Among the research directions is a notion of dimension that is based on the behavior of optimal transportation distance, as well as applications of free information theory techniques to von Neumann algebra theory. The project includes a mixture of problems, some coming from existing research directions and some exploring new lines of inquiry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former compares geometric measurements (such as volume and surface area) while the latter recovers the shape of geometric figures using local versions of these measurements. The two types of problems are inherently connected. This project will exploit this connection to seek answers to either isoperimetric problems or Minkowski problems in various settings when answers to one exist while answers to the other remain elusive. Although these problems originate from a geometric background, their applications extend beyond mathematics into engineering and design, including areas like antenna reflector design and urban planning. The principal investigator will organize a series of events and workshops at local science museums, community centers, and schools, involving high school teachers and students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. These events and workshops aim to expose the fun and exploratory side of the principal investigator?s research and mathematics in general to students early in their educational careers, raise society's awareness and interest in mathematics, and promote mathematics among historically underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The existence of solutions to the dual Minkowski problem (that characterizes dual curvature measures)  in the original symmetric case has been largely settled (by the principal investigator and his collaborators) through techniques from geometry and analysis. This naturally leads to conjectures involving isoperimetric problems connected to the dual Minkowski problem. Such conjectured isoperimetric inequalities are also connected to an intriguing question behind many other conjectures in convexity: how does certain symmetry improve estimates? The principal investigator will also study Minkowski problems and isoperimetric inequalities coming from affine geometry. Special cases of these isoperimetric inequalities are connected to an affine version of the sharp fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren-Lieb. The techniques involved in studying these questions are from Convex Geometric Analysis and PDE. In the last few decades (particularly the last two), there has been a community-wide effort to extend results in the theory of convex bodies to their counterparts in the space of log-concave functions. In this project, the principal investigator will also continue his past work to extend dual curvature measures, their Minkowski problems, and associated isoperimetric inequality to the space of log-concave functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis studies the behavior and regularity of functions defined on and taking values in spaces of complex numbers. It remains an indispensable tool across many domains in the sciences, engineering, and economics. This project considers the smoothness of transformations on a domain defined by complex valued functions when the domain is deformed. Using integral formulas, the PI will study how invariants of a domain vary when the underlying structure of the domain changes. Another component of the project involves the study of resonance. The PI will use small divisors that measure non-resonance to classify singularities of the complex structure arising in linear approximations of curved manifolds. The project will involve collaboration with researchers in an early career stage and will support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>Motivated by recent counterexamples showing that smooth families of domains may be equivalent by a discontinuous family of biholomorphisms, the PI will study the existence of families of biholomorphisms between families of domains using biholomorphism groups and other analytic tools such as Bergman metrics. The PI will construct a global homotopy formula with good estimates for suitable domains in a complex manifold. One of the goals is to construct a global formula in cases when a local homotopy formula fails to exist. The PI will use such global homotopy formulas to investigate the stability of holomorphic embeddings of domains with strongly pseudoconvex or concave boundary in a complex manifold, when the complex structure on the domains is deformed. The PI will use this approach to investigate stability of global Cauchy-Riemann structures on Cauchy-Riemann manifolds of higher codimension. The project seeks a holomorphic classification of neighborhoods of embeddings of a compact complex manifold in complex manifolds via the Levi-form and curvature of the normal bundle. In addition, the PI will study the classification of Cauchy-Riemann singularities for real manifolds using methods from several complex variables and small-divisor conditions in dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the conference is designed to attract PhD students and post-doctoral scholars into working on innovations at this interface. <br/> <br/>To encourage the development of new ideas, the conference speakers, collectively, represent many subfields that have developed their own distinctive blend of analysis and number theory, such as analytic number theory, arithmetic statistics, analytic theory of modular and automorphic forms, additive combinatorics, discrete harmonic analysis, and decoupling. While there have been a wide variety of conferences featuring these subfields in relative isolation, the PIs are excited at PLANT's potential for sparking links among all of these subfields and giving early-career participants the opportunity to be part of this exchange.

This field is concerns functions with Fourier transform (frequencies) supported (non-zero at most) on some curved objects such as a sphere or a cone. Such functions appear naturally in several areas of science and mathematics: in the study of Schrödinger equations, wave equations and number theory. For instance, a solution to the linear wave equation can be represented as a function with Fourier transform supported on a cone. Investigating these functions allows one to understand how waves evolve in time. In number theory, one can count the number of integer solutions to some Diophantine equations (polynomial equations with integer coefficients) by estimating such functions. Namely, if the corresponding functions are concentrated, then one expects the Diophantine equation to have many integer solutions. And an upper bound on the number of solutions can be given in terms of how spread out the functions are. This project will be focused on how the curvature of the Fourier support prevents the functions from being concentrated.<br/><br/>The work will be concentrated on oscillatory integrals and related to Falconer's conjecture. The latter is an unsolved question concerning the sets of Euclidean distances between points in compact d-dimensional spaces. The projects on oscillatory integrals concern the restriction conjecture, the Hormander operator, and decoupling questions. For the restriction conjecture, Stein's restriction conjecture will be studied in higher dimensions and in dimension three. For the Hörmander operator the Bochner-Riesz conjecture will be investigated by considering it as a Hörmander operator not satisfying Bourgain's ""generic failure"" condition. Work will be done on the dimension of radial projections with applications surrounding Falconer's conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of the conference is to convene leading international scholars, early career researchers, and PhD students in the fields of harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory, to disseminate the most recent advances. Harmonic analysis is a foundational mathematical subject that touches upon many different areas of study. Since its inception, the subject of harmonic analysis has developed in close connection to the theory of partial differential equations. In recent years, substantial interest has focused on the use of harmonic analysis as a tool to address questions arising in other fields such as geometric measure theory and number theory. The participation of advanced graduate students and early-career U.S. researchers in this event will facilitate the development of new research collaborations and will strengthen the U.S. research community in this active field.<br/><br/>This conference will bring together experts in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations and geometric measure theory to highlight and disseminate recent research progress. These three subjects have had a symbiotic relationship for a long time. Existence and uniqueness of solutions to partial differential equations can be understood through mapping properties and regularity of Calderón-Zygmund operators, a classical topic in harmonic analysis. Rectifiability of sets in Euclidean spaces can be studied through the properties of harmonic measure on their boundaries, which connects to key subjects and tools in partial differential equations. The goal of this workshop is to foster progress in all three of these areas by leveraging their inherent interconnectedness and by bringing together a collection of leading researchers to discuss recent advances and to chart the directions for future progress.

This research is divided into two themes: low dimensional topology and operator K-theory. In both fields, the aforementioned analytic tools are used to build invariants to study the geometric structure of manifolds, which are spaces modelled on Euclidean spaces, like the 3-dimensional space we live in. In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them. These questions have a wide range of applications in biology and physics. The educational and outreach goals of this project involve math and general STEM enrichment programs at the middle and high school levels, with a focus on programs aimed at students from underserved communities and underrepresented groups, as well as mentorship in research at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>In low dimensional topology, this project focuses on furthering our understanding of instanton and monopole Floer homologies and their relation to Khovanov homology, and using this to study existence questions of families of metrics with positive scalar curvature on manifolds, as well as questions about knot concordance. Separately this project also involves computationally studying knot concordance, both by a computer search for concordances and by computationally studying certain local equivalence and almost local equivalence groups that receive homomorphisms from the knot concordance groups. In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding stability of black holes has been central to the mathematical endeavor of confirming their relevance as realistic physical objects. If stable, black holes perturbed with gravitational or other form of radiation, after a temporary change, would eventually return to their initial state. The investigator aims to advance the current knowledge of perturbations dynamics by including interaction of electromagnetic radiation with gravitational waves. This interaction is significant as astrophysical black holes are thought to be surrounded by an accretion disk of matter which, in particular, contains electromagnetic waves. The results of this work are shared with the mathematical and physical communities through peer-reviewed publications and seminars and disseminated to the general public through media articles, public lectures and outreach events in schools. The research of the investigator is integrated with educational activities that increase representation of women in mathematics and promote engagement in mathematics among students.

The investigator incorporates new techniques to obtain precise decay for the gravitational and electromagnetic waves on charged black holes by developing a universal method involving a combined energy-momentum tensor for coupled system of wave equations. The goal of the project is to prove the non-linear stability of the most general charged and rotating black hole family and extend the investigator?s collaborative work on the resolution for the Kerr family. In addition, the investigator aims to obtain conservation laws for charged black holes in connection with their canonical energy while allowing control of the gravitational and electromagnetic energy radiated at infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, one isoperimetric-type inequality gives the mathematical justification that a metal rod will have the strongest resistance to twisting forces if its cross-sections are circular. This project investigates several geometric questions related to isoperimetric and Sobolev-type inequalities, including the following: if one only has measurements of a given rod's resistance to twisting forces, how much geometric information can be recovered about the shape of the rod's cross-sections? Questions of this type have powerful and sometimes unexpected applications in other branches of mathematics. A fundamental part of the project is a two-pillared educational component. First, the Principal Investigator (PI) will organize a workshop for women in analysis at Carnegie Mellon University, integrating research and education through mini-courses, research talks, and opportunities for junior researchers.

Major themes of the conference include irregularity in pure and applied mathematics, science, and engineering; analysis of networks; and applications involving fractals and irregular shapes. A clear emphasis will be put on theoretical and numerical methods oriented towards applications in engineering and the sciences. Anticipated impacts include increased activity in joint international research projects, academic visits, funding applications, and workshop activities involving experts from applied and pure mathematics. Additional impact is generated through the involvement of beginning researchers in novel research questions on fractal models in pure and applied mathematics, leading to follow-up activities such as student exchanges and internships at theoretical and applied research institutions. This event, the first in a planned series of conferences dedicated to the topic, will foster a vibrant international research community with a clear focus on the use of fractal models in applied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.<br/><br/>The use of fractal models in scientific and industrial applications is a promising area of research, with significant near-term potential for intellectual advances. Although a considerable body of theoretical knowledge is available, the transfer of that knowledge into applied disciplines remains underdeveloped. Two major types of activities are needed in order to effect such a transfer. First is the design of new theoretical models for observed phenomena, for which traditional (smooth) models either cannot be applied or fail to describe relevant features. Second is the development of tools to harvest these theoretical models for applications. In many cases, the fractal model is neither accessible to numerical methods nor useful to construct prototypes. Instead, one must rely on tractable, non-fractal approximations that capture essential features of the truly fractal model, buttressed by theoretical approximation results (e.g., spectral convergence, approximations by graphs or metric graphs) and suitable numerical methods (new specific domain decompositions and meshes, preconditioning techniques, robust and fast-converging schemes). The goal of this conference is to foster ties between pure and applied research communities in order to advance the aforementioned knowledge transfer.<br/><br/>https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2950.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
