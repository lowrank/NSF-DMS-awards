The primary goal of the conference is to foster interaction and collaboration between researchers in several fields of mathematics: fractal geometry, complex dynamics, thermodynamic formalism, random dynamical systems, and open dynamical systems. These fields are interrelated through both the methods used and in the fundamental questions of their study. The conference will bring together mathematicians from these fields ranging from senior experts to graduate students; experts will give standard 45?50-minute plenary lectures, and students will have the opportunity to give 5-10 minute ?lightning talks?. The conference will also include a career panel. More information on the conference, including a list of speakers, can be found on the conference website: https://pcallaart3.wixsite.com/conference.<br/> <br/>The fields represented in this conference have broad motivations and applications in several classical areas of mathematics and physics beyond dynamical systems and geometry, including number theory, probability theory, and statistical mechanics. Thermodynamic formalism is a framework for unifying many aspects of these fields, and its investigation triggers research and collaboration on the problem of the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states of the various systems studied in these fields. Limit sets of conformal dynamical systems, and in particular Julia sets arising in complex dynamics, are typically of a fractal nature and understanding their fine fractal properties such as Hausdorff, packing, Assouad and Fourier dimensions provides a true challenge for fractal geometers. The conference aims to advance research in these directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In other words, the aim is to understand the processes through which a system's behavior evolves from periodicity toward chaos, as one or more governing parameters are varied. A related goal is to identify the primary bifurcation responsible for qualitative changes exhibited by a dynamical system. While such comprehension has previously been attained for low-dimensional dynamical systems, this project introduces a novel approach to transcend the low-dimensional limitation. The project will offer new conceptual ideas and approaches to provide fresh perspectives on advances in mathematics and science. Additionally, the project will facilitate the training of graduate students directly engaged in the research, and will afford educational opportunities to undergraduate students through the organization of a summer school presenting topics in mathematics, including topics related to dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems successfully explains the depth and complexity of chaotic phenomena in concert with a description of the dynamics of typical orbits for typical maps. Its remarkable universality properties supplement this understanding with powerful geometric tools. In the two-dimensional setting, the range of possible dynamical scenarios that can emerge is at present only partially understood, and a general framework for those new phenomena that do not occur for one-dimensional dynamics remains to be developed. In prior work supported by the NSF, the principal investigator introduced a large open class of two-dimensional dynamical systems, including the classical Henon family without the restriction of large area contraction, that is amenable to obtaining results as in the one-dimensional case. Moreover, major progress was reached to understand the transition from zero entropy to positive entropy using renormalization schemes. The present project has several components. First, existing renormalization schemes will be adapted to the positive entropy realm. Next, initial steps towards a characterization of dissipative diffeomorphisms in more general contexts will be addressed. Finally, the principal investigator will seek to develop the theory of differentiable renormalization without an a priori assumption of proximity to the one-dimensional setting. These results will open the door to a global description of dissipative diffeomorphisms and their behavior under perturbation, bringing both new tools and new perspectives to smooth dynamical systems theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conformal mappings are planar transformations which locally preserve angles. An important example is the Mercator projection in cartography, used to project the surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional map. More recently, much attention has been devoted to the study of quasiconformal mappings, a generalization of conformal mappings where a controlled amount of angle distortion is permitted. Because of this additional flexibility, quasiconformal mappings have proven over the years to be of fundamental importance in a wide variety of areas of mathematics and applications. Many of these applications involve planar transformations that are quasiconformal inside a given region except possibly for some exceptional set of points inside the region. The study of this exceptional set leads to the notion of removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex analysis, dynamical systems, probability and related areas. Another focus of this project is on the study of certain families of quasiconformal mappings called holomorphic motions. The principal investigator will study how quantities such as dimension and area change under holomorphic motions, leading to a better understanding of the geometric properties of quasiconformal mappings. The project also provides opportunities for the training and mentoring of early career researchers, including graduate students. In addition, the principal investigator will continue to be involved in a science and mathematics outreach program for local high school students.<br/><br/>Two strands of research comprise the planned work. The first component involves the study of conformal removability. Motivated by the long-standing Koebe uniformization conjecture, the principal investigator will investigate the relationship between removability and the rigidity of circle domains. This part of the project also involves the study of conformal welding, a correspondence between planar Jordan curves and functions on the circle. Recent years have witnessed a renewal of interest in conformal welding along with new generalizations and variants, notably in the theory of random surfaces and in connection with applications to computer vision and numerical pattern recognition. The second component of the project concerns holomorphic motions. The principal investigator will study the variation of several notions of dimension under holomorphic motions. A new approach to this topic by the principal investigator and his collaborators using inf-harmonic functions has already yielded a unified treatment of several celebrated theorems about quasiconformal mappings, and many more fruitful connections are anticipated as progress continues to be made towards a better understanding of holomorphic motions. This part of the project also involves the relationship between global quasiconformal dimension and conformal dimension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First by Bidone in Turin in 1826, and then famously by Russell in 1834 who followed a hump of water moving at constant speed along a channel for several miles. Today these objects are known as solitons. Lying at the intersection of mathematics and physics, they have been studied rigorously since the 1960s. For completely integrable wave equations, many properties of solitons are known, such as their elastic collisions, their stability properties, as well as their role as building blocks in the long-time description of waves. The latter is particularly important, as it for example predicts how waves carrying information decompose into quantifiable units. In quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and material science, these mathematical tools allow for a better understanding of the movement of electrons in various media. This project aims to develop the mathematical foundations which support these areas in applied science, which are of great importance to industry and society at large. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project?s goal is to establish both new results and new techniques in nonlinear evolution partial differential equations on the one hand, and the spectral theory of disordered systems on the other hand. The long-range scattering theory developed by Luhrmann and the Principal Investigator (PI) achieved the first results on potentials which exhibit a threshold resonance in the context of topological solitons. This work is motivated by the fundamental question about asymptotic kink stability for the phi-4 model. Asymptotic stability of Ginzburg-Landau vortices in their own equivariance class is not understood. The linearized problem involves a non-selfadjoint matrix operator, and the PI has begun to work on its spectral theory. With collaborators, the PI will engage on research on bubbling for the harmonic map heat flow and attempt to combine the recent paper on continuous-in-time bubbling with a suitable modulation theory. The third area relevant to this project is the spectral theory of disordered systems. More specifically, the PI will continue his work on quasiperiodic symplectic cocycles which arise in several models in condensed matter physics such as in graphene and on non-perturbative methods to analyze them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mathematical equations model a wide range of physical phenomena arising in fluid dynamics (oceanography), quantum mechanics, plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and general relativity. The equations being studied range from semilinear to fully nonlinear, and from local to nonlocal equations, and we aim to investigate them in an optimal fashion both locally and globally in time. This research develops and connects ideas and methods in partial differential equations, and in some cases also draws a clear path towards other problems in fields such as geometry, harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and microlocal analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The strength of the nonlinear wave interactions is the common feature in the models considered in this proposal, and it significantly impacts both their short-time and their long-time behavior. The project addresses a series of very interesting questions concerning several classes of nonlinear dispersive equations: (i) short-time existence theory in a low regularity setting; (ii) breakdown of waves, and here a particular class of equations is provided by the water wave models; and (iii) long-time persistence and/or dispersion and decay of waves, which would involve either a qualitative aspect attached to it, that is, an asymptotic description of the nonlinear solution, or a quantitative description of it, for instance nontraditional scattering statements providing global in time dispersive bounds. All of this also depends strongly on the initial data properties, such as size, regularity and localization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This sequence could be highly structured - for instance, it could alternate periodically between 0 and 1.  Or it could be completely random, with the value of each member of the sequence having no relation whatsoever to the next.  It could also be ""pseudorandom"" - described by a deterministic algorithm, but yet statistically indistinguishable from a genuinely random sequence.  Or it could be some complex mixture of structure and (pseudo)randomness.  Can one define precisely what structure and randomness mean and describe arbitrary data as combinations of these two different components?  Such questions are of importance in cryptography, computer science, combinatorics, dynamics, and number theory, as they allow one to mathematically determine whether certain patterns in arbitrary streams of data are guaranteed to occur or not.  For instance, in 2004, Ben Green and the PI were able to settle a long-standing conjecture in number theory that the prime numbers contained arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, with the key idea being to break up the prime numbers into structured and random components and study the contribution of each component.  In computer science, this theory has led, for instance, to efficient ways to generate pseudorandom bits for several types of applications. In the subsequent twenty years, much progress has been made in quantifying more precisely what structure and randomness mean, particularly in the area of mathematics now known as higher-order Fourier analysis.  More understanding has been gained on the precise way in which number-theoretic structures, such as the primes, exhibit (pseudo-)random behavior at both large and small scales. There has been steady progress in this direction in recent years, in which the scale on which one is able to definitively demonstrate various types of pseudorandomness has narrowed over time, and further work will be carried out in this project, in particular, it is tantalizingly near to resolve (a version) of a well-known conjecture in number theory - the Chowla conjecture - which could be in turn a stepping stone to even more famous conjectures such as the twin prime conjecture. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>In this project, the PI (in conjunction with collaborators) plans to work on two related projects.  Firstly, the PI will continue recent work on developing general inverse theorems for the Gowers uniformity norms in additive combinatorics on one hand and the Host--Kra uniformity seminorms in ergodic theory on the other.  Secondly, the PI will continue building upon recent breakthroughs in the understanding of multiplicative functions, to make further progress towards the (logarithmically averaged) Chowla and Elliott conjectures for such functions, and to apply these results to related problems in analytic number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-similar sets are characterized by the property that they look the same at different scales. Such sets arise in the study of dynamical systems, for instance, in complex dynamics and the study of the Mandelbrot set. On the other hand, in probability theory and statistical physics one often encounters stochastically self-similar sets. Such objects only have the same statistical properties at different scales. There are surprising analogies between the probabilistic theory and its deterministic counterpart. The research supported by this award explores these analogies and addresses foundational questions regarding self-similar objects, using methods from complex analysis. The project also provides opportunities for the training and mentoring of junior researchers, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The PI will contribute to the dissemination of mathematical knowledge through the organization of conferences, workshops, and summer schools.<br/><br/>Research to be conducted under this award involves the geometry of conformally self-similar structures, both in stochastic and deterministic settings. Julia sets for the iteration of complex mappings illustrate the latter setting, while the former includes topics such as Schramm-Loewner evolution. The project aims to answer fundamental regularity questions for conformally self-similar objects, including Jordan curves of finite Loewner energy. A new parametrization of the Teichmueller spaces of punctured spheres will also be studied. Additional motivation for the project arises from the interaction between the deterministic and stochastic frameworks, notably, the transfer of methods and results between these two areas. For instance, the concept of conformal mating of polynomials in complex dynamics bears close similarity to Sheffield's mating of trees construction for random spheres. The PI?s research uses methods developed in complex dynamics to provide analytic constructions for random structures. Conversely, insights from the probabilistic theory translate to new research avenues in complex dynamics. Conformal welding is a tool of central importance in both theories, and the proposal aims to resolve several fundamental questions regarding Weil-Petersson curves, welding of Liouville Quantum Gravity discs, and Werner's conformal restriction measure on Jordan curves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such equations arise, for example, in the mathematical theory of heat conduction: an equation of elliptic type describes steady state (equilibrium) temperature distributions and a related parabolic equation governs heat conduction in the time-evolutive case. In a boundary value problem, one uses mathematical knowledge of either 1) the temperature distribution on the boundary (i.e., perimeter) of some region in space (or of some evolving region in space-time) or 2) the heat flux (the rate at which heat flows across the boundary), to deduce information about the internal temperature distribution inside the region. In free boundary problems, one uses simultaneous knowledge of both the boundary temperature distribution and the heat flux to deduce information about the geometry of the region and its boundary. A central goal of this project is to understand the interplay between analytic information and geometry. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project has three main areas of focus:  1) to find a geometric characterization of the space-time domains for which the Dirichlet (or initial-Dirichlet) problem is solvable for the heat equation with singular (p-integrable) data, and to study related free boundary problems. The PI and coauthors have previously treated such problems in the steady state (elliptic) setting; in the present project, the PI seeks to treat the more difficult time-evolutive case. 2) to solve the Kato square root problem for elliptic equations in non-divergence form. The solution of the Kato problem for divergence form elliptic operators has led to significant progress in the theory of boundary value problems for divergence form equations. As a first step towards opening up the analogous theory in the nondivergence setting, the PI plans to treat the Kato problem for non-divergence elliptic operators.   3) to solve the Dirichlet problem in Lipschitz domains for non-symmetric divergence from elliptic equations with periodic coefficients.  A primary motivation for the study of operators with periodic coefficients is their applicability to the theory of homogenization, which in turn provides a mathematical model for materials with periodic microstructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical setting of this problem pertains to particle systems which collide according to the laws of classical mechanics. The same problem emerges in more modern theories of statistical physics, where particles are replaced by waves that interact according to some Hamiltonian wave-type partial differential equation. Such theories of statistical physics for waves often go by the name of ?wave turbulence theory?, because they play a central role in understanding turbulent behaviors in wave systems. This has applications in many areas of science such as quantum mechanics, oceanography, climate science, etc. Broadly speaking, the goal of this project is to advance the mathematical, and hence scientific, understanding of such turbulence theories, and settle some longstanding conjectures in mathematical physics on the foundations of statistical mechanics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Even in its classical setting, Hilbert?s sixth problem remains a formidable task, that has only been resolved for short times. The project seeks to provide its long-time resolution, thus giving a final answer to this longstanding open problem. This amounts to giving the rigorous derivation of Boltzmann?s kinetic equation starting from Newton?s laws, followed by the derivation of the macroscopic fluid models (Euler?s and Navier-Stokes equations). In parallel, the project proposes similar justifications in the setting of wave turbulence theory. There too, the Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to provide the long-time derivation of the corresponding ?wave kinetic equations? for various wave systems of scientific interest. Starting with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation as a prime model for nonlinear wave systems, this will be followed by similar investigations for other wave systems, like many-particle quantum systems and some models coming from ocean and climate science. Finally, the project will investigate mathematical problems related to the turbulence aspects of wave turbulence theory. There, the PI intends to use the above rigorous derivation of the wave kinetic equations, combined with an analysis of solutions to those equations, to understand turbulence phenomena for wave systems, such as energy cascades and growth of Sobolev norms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These situations can lead to equations that are much harder to analyze, and traditional methods may not work. Another area of study is equations from fluid dynamics. Understanding these questions is crucial for practical applications like designing airplanes or predicting weather patterns, and it also inspires new ideas in mathematics and statistics. Finally, the Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in kinetic equations, which describe how particles move and interact in systems like nuclear fusion experiments.

The large-scale variation energy is associated with the collection called Besov space of functions. Recent research has uncovered a connection between local energies on a region in a metric measure space and nonlocal energies on the boundary of the region. The project will leverage this connection to explore the large-scale geometry of nonlocal energies on the boundary of the region by linking them with small-scale behavior of local energies on the region itself. In particular, connections between Dirichlet-type boundary value problems and Neumann-type boundary value problems will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In other words, operations typically do not commute; this is why matrices, which encode noncommutativity in mathematics, are omnipresent in science. While matrix and operator theory has been profoundly developed in the past, the fast-evolving technological advances raise new challenges that have to be addressed. Concretely, expanding quantum technologies, complex control systems, and new resources in optimization and computability pose questions about ensembles of matrices and their features that are independent of the matrix size. The common framework for studying such problems is provided by free analysis (""free"" as in size-free), which investigates functions in matrix and operator variables. This project focuses on such functions that are built only using variables and arithmetic operations, and are therefore called noncommutative polynomials and rational functions. While these are more tangible and computationally accessible than general noncommutative functions, most of their fundamental features are yet to be explored. The scope of the project is to investigate noncommutative rational functions and their variations, develop a theory that allows resolving open problems about them, and finally apply these resolutions to tackle emerging challenges in optimization, control systems, and quantum information. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The scope of this project is twofold. Firstly, the project aims to answer several function-theoretic open problems on rational operations in noncommuting variables. Among these are singularities and vanishing of rational expressions in bounded operator variables, geometric and structural detection of composition in noncommutative rational functions using control-theoretic tools, noncommutative tensor-rational functions and their role in computational complexity, and existence of low-rank values of noncommutative polynomials with a view towards noncommutative algebraic geometry and approximate zero sets. These fundamental problems call for new synergistic methods that combine complex analysis, representation theory, algebraic geometry and operator theory. Secondly, the project aims to advance the framework of positivity and optimization in several operator variables without dimension restrictions, where the objective functions and constraints are noncommutative polynomials and their variations. The approach to this goal leads through functional analysis, real algebraic geometry and operator algebras. Moreover, the project seeks to apply these new optimization algorithms in quantum information theory, to study nonlinear Bell inequalities in complex quantum networks and the self-testing phenomenon in device-independent certification and cryptographic security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We observe them when we look at the ripples that form when we throw a pebble in a lake, the expanding ring called a wave-packet; or when we look at a rainbow that is formed when light wave passes through a prism or water droplet and note the spatial separation of white light into different colors. Partial differential equations (PDE) modeling wave propagation phenomena have played a fundamental role in understanding such physical and natural events as well as quantum mechanics, fiber optics, ferromagnetism, atmospheric and water waves, and many other physical models. In these cases, wave phenomena are never too smooth or too simple, and in fact the byproduct of nonlinear wave interactions as they propagate in time. Being able to understand and describe the dynamical behavior of such models under certain noisy conditions or given an initial statistical ensemble and have a precise description of how the inherent randomness built in these models propagates, is fundamental to accurately predict wave phenomena when studying the natural world. This project is aimed at answering several central questions about long-time dynamics and the propagation of randomness in this context using analytical and probabilistic methodologies. The work of the project, and its connections to science, promotes interdisciplinary interactions and fosters the training of graduate students and junior researchers in the United States thus fundamentally contributing to its STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The interplay of deterministic methods in nonlinear PDE and probabilistic ones naturally feed off each other and when combined contribute to a deep understanding of wave phenomena, which opens the door to new paradigms that move research forward in various directions. The Principal Investigator studies several projects at the forefront of current research. The problems, grouped in two interrelated directions, aim broadly at: (1) studying the out of equilibrium long-time dynamics of dispersive flows from a probabilistic viewpoint in energy subcritical regimes by means of suitable quantitative quasi-invariance, modified energies and stability theory of random structures; (2) establishing the invariance of Gibbs measures for the probabilistically critical three-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation (also known as a model in constructive quantum field theory) in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics; (3) establishing a suitable probabilistic local theory of the hyperbolic sine-Gordon equation on 2D tori and the invariance of its associated Gibbs measure; and (4) the development of the random tensor theory for the nonlinear wave equations and for non-Gaussian data.

Motivation to study these questions can be found in partial differential equations, which are fundamental to the study of science and engineering. The solution to a partial differential equation is frequently given by an integral operator, a Calderon-Zygmund operator, whose related properties can be used to deduce related properties of these partial differential equations. In general, studying these Calderon-Zygmund operators is challenging and one seeks to study their action on certain spaces of functions, by checking the behavior only on a simpler class of test functions. In analogy, this can be seen as attempting to understand a complicated musical score by simply understanding a simpler finite collection of pure frequencies. The proposed research is based on recent contributions made by the PI, leveraging the skills and knowledge developed through prior National Science Foundation awards. Through this proposal the PI will address open and important questions at the interface of analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  Resolution of questions in these areas will provide for additional lines of inquiry.

In particular, applications of the proof strategy of testing theorems will: (1) be used to characterize when Calderon-Zygmund operators are bounded between weighted spaces both for continuous and dyadic variants of these operators; (2) serve as motivation for a class of questions related to operators on the Fock space of analytic functions that are intimately connected to Calderon-Zygmund operators; and, (3) be leveraged to provide a method to study Carleson measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions.

While this tool was initially intended to analyze differential equations that describe wave cancellations, it has also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. For example, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers. They are used to generate scrambling and diffusion keys, which are instrumental in encrypting data. Mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner. But we can think of numbers as frequencies and thus associate them with waves.  In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. This was the case with PI's breakthrough resolution of the Main Conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem. The PI plans to further extend the scope of decoupling toward the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and number theory.  He will seek to make the new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community.

The current project seeks to further expand the applicability of this method in new directions. One of them is concerned with finding sharp estimates for the Fourier transforms of fractal measures supported on curved manifolds.

This project aims to understand the properties of some fundamental PDE models for the diffusion of gas, the shape of liquid droplets, and electric transmission in composite materials. Many such processes exhibit an interface, where the equation becomes degenerate or singular. In the case of a model of gas diffusion through a porous medium, the interface is the set which separates the region where there is gas from the region where there is no gas. The boundary of a liquid droplet is another example of an interface. The project will investigate qualitative and quantitative properties of these interfaces, including convexity and smoothness. For a composite material, consisting of two materials with different conductivity properties, the interface is where these materials meet. The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the behavior of the electric field when one of the materials has a very thin part. This project has possible implications for material failure, an important question in Engineering. Students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained on the techniques and theory of these PDE models.<br/><br/>This project centers on four topics, connected by the themes of interfaces, degeneracies, and convexity/concavity. The porous medium equation is a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation used to model the diffusion of gas. The PI will investigate questions of concavity and convexity of solutions and finding global optimal regularity estimates. Secondly, the PI will study linear PDE whose coefficients are discontinuous along two almost touching interfaces, a model for transmission problems and composite materials. In this setting, the PI will investigate new approaches to obtaining optimal gradient estimates in the thin region between the interfaces. A third project is to study linear equations which are parabolic on the interior on a fixed domain but are degenerate at the boundary. These equations arise as linearizations of the porous medium equation and the Gauss curvature flow. The PI will investigate optimal conditions for existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions. Finally, questions of concavity of solutions to the elliptic torsion problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions and the dynamic version of this equation, known as the quasi-static droplet model, will be studied.

The specific goals of the project include: (1) understanding the macroscopic concentration of high energy eigenfunctions of closed chaotic systems, such as negatively curved Riemannian manifolds and quantum cat maps; and (2) proving essential spectral gaps (implying in particular exponential local energy decay of waves) for open systems with fractal hyperbolic trapped sets. A second research direction is the study of forced waves in stratified fluids (with similar problems appearing also for rotating fluids), motivated by experimentally observed internal waves in aquaria and by applications to oceanography.

A typical examples include turbulent fluids, such as the earth's atmosphere, which have fluctuations on the human scale (a gust of wind) and on the continental scale (weather patterns), and every scale in between. Other examples include important models in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. Such chaotic physical systems have interesting behaviors which emerge through the interaction of these very different length scales, often called ""critical phenomena"" by physicists. Physicists have developed heuristic, non-rigorous ways of understanding and analyzing many such physical systems, some of which are called ""renormalization group"" arguments. One of the main goals of this project is to develop precise versions of these informal arguments which are mathematically rigorous. In the past decade, the work of the Principal Investigator (PI) and other mathematicians have led to a rigorous theory of ""quantitative homogenization"" of certain partial differential equations. These equations have some of the properties of the complex physical systems mentioned above, and the homogenization theory resembles renormalization group-type arguments in important ways. However, it currently works well only for problems with a small number of length scales. The project proposes to increase the level of sophistication of the homogenization methods until the theory can be deployed more flexibly on physical systems exhibiting critical behavior. This requires the development of new mathematical ideas and concepts and will require input from analysis, probability theory, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/> <br/>The project has two main goals. The first one concerns improving the quantitative homogenization theory, so that it is more explicit in its dependence on important parameters in the equation (like the ellipticity ratio) and allows for degenerate and possibly unbounded coefficient fields. This is a well-known open problem in the subfield, but the PI and his collaborator Kuusi have made recent progress on this question, and this project will continue to develop these new ideas. A second focus of the project is to use these analytic methods developed for homogenization as means of formalizing heuristic renormalization group arguments in physics. Such methods arise in a wide variety of contexts, but the project has a few specific problems in mind. One arises in fluid turbulence, and concerns proving the anomalous diffusion of a passive scalar advected by a rough vector field. The PI and his collaborator Vicol have made recent progress on this question by using homogenization to formalize a renormalization group argument. This points the way to further possibilities, including the construction of more physically realistic examples of anomalous diffusion. Another potential application lies in Euclidean field theory, following a stochastic quantization approach to study Gibbs measures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They arise as effective models of real physical systems, including in optics and many-body quantum mechanics. It is in the setting of completely integrable systems that solitons and multisolitons were first discovered. These structures have since found numerous applications in the applied sciences: for example, in fiber optics, solitons have been employed in the transmission of digital signals over long distances, while in biology, they are used to describe signal propagation in the nervous system and low-frequency collective motion in proteins. This project seeks to investigate both longstanding and newly introduced integrable models. Specifically, we seek to find the minimal conditions on the initial state under which one can construct global-in-time dynamics, investigate the (in)stability of special structures (such as solitons and multisolitons), and elucidate the long-time behavior of general solutions. The project provides significant research training opportunities for graduate students, who are integrated into the main objectives of the project. <br/><br/>The project investigates the following specific questions for the newly introduced continuum Calogero-Moser equations: (1) large data well-posedness in the scaling-invariant space, (2) scattering for both the defocusing model and the focusing equation for initial data with mass less than that of the ground state soliton, and (3) the determination of the blowup threshold in the focusing case. Further objectives include orbital and asymptotic stability of multisoliton solutions to the Benjamin-Ono equation in optimal well-posedness spaces, dispersive decay away from the soliton component for large solutions to this equation, and the construction of Gibbs dynamics for the Landau-Lifshitz model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have since developed into a full area of study as a natural noncommutative notion of measure theory. The noncommutative setting of topology (C*-algebras) emerged shortly after, and the two subjects have historically been closely connected. This project explores these connections to develop new ideas, to reach a broad mathematical community and providing engagement and support for new students in the field.  The investigator is actively participating in the training of students and postdocs in von Neumann algebras and the research from this project will directly impact these students and postdocs. <br/><br/>The project investigator is studying approximation properties (or the lack thereof) in von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, especially relating to group von Neumann algebras and group measure space constructions. This has historically been a significant area of study in the classification of operator algebras, with amenability/injectivity playing a major role in the development of von Neumann algebras, and nuclearity playing a major corresponding role in the theory of C*-algebras. The emergence of Popa's deformation/rigidity theory has led to numerous breakthroughs in the classification of von Neumann algebras beyond the amenability setting, and approximation properties, such as Ozawa's notion of a biexact group, have created new opportunities to study approximation properties in the setting of von Neumann algebras. The research developed in this project investigates these approximation properties, creating new connections between C* and von Neumann algebras. This allows new C*-algebraic tools to be used in the setting of von Neumann algebras, leading to new structural results for group and group measure space von Neumann algebras, and giving a deeper insight into interactions between operator algebras, ergodic theory, and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of the conference is to bring together a diverse group of established and early-career researchers to discuss recent advances in, and applications of, analysis on fractals and networks. Major themes of the conference include irregularity in pure and applied mathematics, science, and engineering; analysis of networks; and applications involving fractals and irregular shapes. A clear emphasis will be put on theoretical and numerical methods oriented towards applications in engineering and the sciences. Anticipated impacts include increased activity in joint international research projects, academic visits, funding applications, and workshop activities involving experts from applied and pure mathematics. Additional impact is generated through the involvement of beginning researchers in novel research questions on fractal models in pure and applied mathematics, leading to follow-up activities such as student exchanges and internships at theoretical and applied research institutions. This event, the first in a planned series of conferences dedicated to the topic, will foster a vibrant international research community with a clear focus on the use of fractal models in applied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.<br/><br/>The use of fractal models in scientific and industrial applications is a promising area of research, with significant near-term potential for intellectual advances. Although a considerable body of theoretical knowledge is available, the transfer of that knowledge into applied disciplines remains underdeveloped. Two major types of activities are needed in order to effect such a transfer. First is the design of new theoretical models for observed phenomena, for which traditional (smooth) models either cannot be applied or fail to describe relevant features. Second is the development of tools to harvest these theoretical models for applications. In many cases, the fractal model is neither accessible to numerical methods nor useful to construct prototypes. Instead, one must rely on tractable, non-fractal approximations that capture essential features of the truly fractal model, buttressed by theoretical approximation results (e.g., spectral convergence, approximations by graphs or metric graphs) and suitable numerical methods (new specific domain decompositions and meshes, preconditioning techniques, robust and fast-converging schemes). The goal of this conference is to foster ties between pure and applied research communities in order to advance the aforementioned knowledge transfer.<br/><br/>https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2950.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elliptic differential equations govern the equilibrium configurations of various physical phenomena, for instance, those arising from minimization problems for natural energy functionals. Examples include the shape of free-hanging bridges, the shape of soap bubbles, and the sound of drums. Elliptic differential equations are also used to quantify the degree to which physical objects are bent or distorted, with far-reaching implications and applications in geometry and topology. The proposed research focuses on the regularity of solutions to such equations. Questions to be addressed include the following: Do non-smooth points (singularities) exist? How large can the set of singularities be? What is the behavior of the solution near a singularity? Is it possible to perturb the underlying environment in order to eliminate the singularity? The project will also provide opportunities for the professional development of graduate students, both via individual mentoring and via the organization of a directed learning seminar on geometric analysis and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical objectives of the project are twofold. First, the principal investigator will study unique continuation for solutions to elliptic partial differential equations, with a focus on quantitative estimates on the size and structure of the singular set of these solutions. A second topic for consideration is the regularity theory for generalized minimal submanifolds (a generalized notion of smooth submanifolds which arise as critical points for the area functional under local deformations). In particular, the principal investigator will study branch singular points in the interior as well as at the boundary of a generalized minimal submanifold, under an area-minimizing or stability assumption. Research on the latter topic, which can be viewed as a non-linear analogue of quantitative unique continuation for elliptic equations, requires the integration of ideas from geometric measure theory, partial differential equations and geometric analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They may be used, for example, to study the evolution of a gas or a plasma. The Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in the study of the Boltzmann and Landau equations, for systems of particles that repel each other by power-law potentials. These equations exhibit a regularization effect. An outstanding open problem is to understand if a singularity could emerge from the natural flow of the equation, or if the regularization effects actually dominate the evolution and keep the solutions smooth. The PI mentors graduate students and postdocs in research on the topics of this project.<br/><br/>This project aims at developing tools in the analysis of nonlocal equations, parabolic equations and hypoelliptic theory targeted to their applications in kinetic equations. The Boltzmann collision operator acts as a nonlinear diffusive operator of fractional order. It can be studied in the framework of parabolic integro-differential equations. The Landau equation is a model from statistical mechanics used to describe the dynamics of plasma. It can be obtained as a limit case of the Boltzmann equation when grazing collisions prevail. It is a second order, nonlinear, parabolic equation. The project connects different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, relating recent progress in nonlinear integro-differential equations with the classical Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics. Kinetic equations involve a nonlinear diffusive operator with respect to velocity, combined with a transport equation with respect to space. The regularization effect in all variables requires ideas from hypoelliptic theory. For the Boltzmann equation in the case of very soft potentials, as well as for the Landau equation with Coulomb potentials, the diffusive part of the equations is not strong enough to prevent the solution from blowing up in theory. In that case, new ideas are needed to properly understand the regularization effects of the equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In classical mechanics it is possible to simultaneously observe and measure various properties of a physical system ? for example, the locations and velocities of all of its components. Such properties are often called observables.  Observables be viewed as functions of the underlying system and form an algebra ? they can be added and multiplied.   In quantum mechanics, simultaneous measurements are no longer possible. Mathematically this is reflected by the non-commutativity of the algebra of observables for quantum systems. Nonetheless, many of the operations that can be done with ordinary functions have quantum analogs.  The current proposal studies such non-commutative algebras of observables from the angle of Voiculescu?s free probability theory, which treats observables as random variables. This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations and Brownian motion, amenable to analysis by techniques inspired by classical information theory.  This project will promote human resource development through graduate and undergraduate research opportunities and will support students under the auspices of the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle.  <br/><br/>The proposed research deals with several questions in von Neumann algebras which are approached by free probability and free information methods, including free entropy theory.  This includes further developing PDE based methods in the non-commutative context and strengthening the connection between free probability and random matrix theory.  Among the research directions is a notion of dimension that is based on the behavior of optimal transportation distance, as well as applications of free information theory techniques to von Neumann algebra theory. The project includes a mixture of problems, some coming from existing research directions and some exploring new lines of inquiry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former compares geometric measurements (such as volume and surface area) while the latter recovers the shape of geometric figures using local versions of these measurements. The two types of problems are inherently connected. This project will exploit this connection to seek answers to either isoperimetric problems or Minkowski problems in various settings when answers to one exist while answers to the other remain elusive. Although these problems originate from a geometric background, their applications extend beyond mathematics into engineering and design, including areas like antenna reflector design and urban planning. The principal investigator will organize a series of events and workshops at local science museums, community centers, and schools, involving high school teachers and students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. These events and workshops aim to expose the fun and exploratory side of the principal investigator?s research and mathematics in general to students early in their educational careers, raise society's awareness and interest in mathematics, and promote mathematics among historically underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The existence of solutions to the dual Minkowski problem (that characterizes dual curvature measures)  in the original symmetric case has been largely settled (by the principal investigator and his collaborators) through techniques from geometry and analysis. This naturally leads to conjectures involving isoperimetric problems connected to the dual Minkowski problem. Such conjectured isoperimetric inequalities are also connected to an intriguing question behind many other conjectures in convexity: how does certain symmetry improve estimates? The principal investigator will also study Minkowski problems and isoperimetric inequalities coming from affine geometry. Special cases of these isoperimetric inequalities are connected to an affine version of the sharp fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren-Lieb. The techniques involved in studying these questions are from Convex Geometric Analysis and PDE. In the last few decades (particularly the last two), there has been a community-wide effort to extend results in the theory of convex bodies to their counterparts in the space of log-concave functions. In this project, the principal investigator will also continue his past work to extend dual curvature measures, their Minkowski problems, and associated isoperimetric inequality to the space of log-concave functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis studies the behavior and regularity of functions defined on and taking values in spaces of complex numbers. It remains an indispensable tool across many domains in the sciences, engineering, and economics. This project considers the smoothness of transformations on a domain defined by complex valued functions when the domain is deformed. Using integral formulas, the PI will study how invariants of a domain vary when the underlying structure of the domain changes. Another component of the project involves the study of resonance. The PI will use small divisors that measure non-resonance to classify singularities of the complex structure arising in linear approximations of curved manifolds. The project will involve collaboration with researchers in an early career stage and will support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>Motivated by recent counterexamples showing that smooth families of domains may be equivalent by a discontinuous family of biholomorphisms, the PI will study the existence of families of biholomorphisms between families of domains using biholomorphism groups and other analytic tools such as Bergman metrics. The PI will construct a global homotopy formula with good estimates for suitable domains in a complex manifold. One of the goals is to construct a global formula in cases when a local homotopy formula fails to exist. The PI will use such global homotopy formulas to investigate the stability of holomorphic embeddings of domains with strongly pseudoconvex or concave boundary in a complex manifold, when the complex structure on the domains is deformed. The PI will use this approach to investigate stability of global Cauchy-Riemann structures on Cauchy-Riemann manifolds of higher codimension. The project seeks a holomorphic classification of neighborhoods of embeddings of a compact complex manifold in complex manifolds via the Levi-form and curvature of the normal bundle. In addition, the PI will study the classification of Cauchy-Riemann singularities for real manifolds using methods from several complex variables and small-divisor conditions in dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will bring 26 internationally-recognized mathematicians to each give a 50-minute talk and participate throughout the week. It will also support the participation of a number of early career researchers. All participants will have the opportunity to present their research in a poster session running throughout the week, and an open problem session will focus on future directions of research. The Spring School will take place during the second week, May 19-23, 2024. It will be led by two young experts, Drs. Durcik and Roos, with 10 to 15 participants at the graduate student or postdoctoral level. The participants will prepare presentations from a list of important papers in the field in advance and during the Spring School, they will study the papers together under the guidance of Drs. Durcik and Roos which will introduce these junior researchers to important recent developments in the field and gain a broad understanding of this every active area of mathematics. These two events are connected for synergistic purposes; junior researchers will be invited to the conference to learn more from more senior researchers, where they can present their own work in a poster session, and they can stay for the summer school for a more in-depth study. Thus, organizing the two events consecutively will provide enhanced opportunities for junior researchers to network, share their results, and learn from their peers and more senior researchers. The organizers have dedicated a substantial portion of the conference budget to the participation of early-career mathematicians. They will make special efforts to invite and encourage the participation of women and members of other underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>The topics to be discussed at the conference will include, but will not be limited to, the following important developments in harmonic analysis in recent years: the Fourier restriction and Bochner?Riesz problems; decoupling inequalities and local smoothing problems in Fourier analysis and their applications, applications to geometric measure theory; inequalities of Brascamp-Lieb type; sparse domination inequalities and their application to weighted norm theory; analysis problems for the Hamming cube; subelliptic partial differential equations and generalized pseudo-differential operators.

This field is concerns functions with Fourier transform (frequencies) supported (non-zero at most) on some curved objects such as a sphere or a cone. Such functions appear naturally in several areas of science and mathematics: in the study of Schrödinger equations, wave equations and number theory. For instance, a solution to the linear wave equation can be represented as a function with Fourier transform supported on a cone. Investigating these functions allows one to understand how waves evolve in time. In number theory, one can count the number of integer solutions to some Diophantine equations (polynomial equations with integer coefficients) by estimating such functions. Namely, if the corresponding functions are concentrated, then one expects the Diophantine equation to have many integer solutions. And an upper bound on the number of solutions can be given in terms of how spread out the functions are. This project will be focused on how the curvature of the Fourier support prevents the functions from being concentrated.<br/><br/>The work will be concentrated on oscillatory integrals and related to Falconer's conjecture. The latter is an unsolved question concerning the sets of Euclidean distances between points in compact d-dimensional spaces. The projects on oscillatory integrals concern the restriction conjecture, the Hormander operator, and decoupling questions. For the restriction conjecture, Stein's restriction conjecture will be studied in higher dimensions and in dimension three. For the Hörmander operator the Bochner-Riesz conjecture will be investigated by considering it as a Hörmander operator not satisfying Bourgain's ""generic failure"" condition. Work will be done on the dimension of radial projections with applications surrounding Falconer's conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of the conference is to convene leading international scholars, early career researchers, and PhD students in the fields of harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory, to disseminate the most recent advances. Harmonic analysis is a foundational mathematical subject that touches upon many different areas of study. Since its inception, the subject of harmonic analysis has developed in close connection to the theory of partial differential equations. In recent years, substantial interest has focused on the use of harmonic analysis as a tool to address questions arising in other fields such as geometric measure theory and number theory. The participation of advanced graduate students and early-career U.S. researchers in this event will facilitate the development of new research collaborations and will strengthen the U.S. research community in this active field.<br/><br/>This conference will bring together experts in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations and geometric measure theory to highlight and disseminate recent research progress. These three subjects have had a symbiotic relationship for a long time. Existence and uniqueness of solutions to partial differential equations can be understood through mapping properties and regularity of Calderón-Zygmund operators, a classical topic in harmonic analysis. Rectifiability of sets in Euclidean spaces can be studied through the properties of harmonic measure on their boundaries, which connects to key subjects and tools in partial differential equations. The goal of this workshop is to foster progress in all three of these areas by leveraging their inherent interconnectedness and by bringing together a collection of leading researchers to discuss recent advances and to chart the directions for future progress.

This research is divided into two themes: low dimensional topology and operator K-theory. In both fields, the aforementioned analytic tools are used to build invariants to study the geometric structure of manifolds, which are spaces modelled on Euclidean spaces, like the 3-dimensional space we live in. In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them. These questions have a wide range of applications in biology and physics. The educational and outreach goals of this project involve math and general STEM enrichment programs at the middle and high school levels, with a focus on programs aimed at students from underserved communities and underrepresented groups, as well as mentorship in research at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>In low dimensional topology, this project focuses on furthering our understanding of instanton and monopole Floer homologies and their relation to Khovanov homology, and using this to study existence questions of families of metrics with positive scalar curvature on manifolds, as well as questions about knot concordance. Separately this project also involves computationally studying knot concordance, both by a computer search for concordances and by computationally studying certain local equivalence and almost local equivalence groups that receive homomorphisms from the knot concordance groups. In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding stability of black holes has been central to the mathematical endeavor of confirming their relevance as realistic physical objects. If stable, black holes perturbed with gravitational or other form of radiation, after a temporary change, would eventually return to their initial state. The investigator aims to advance the current knowledge of perturbations dynamics by including interaction of electromagnetic radiation with gravitational waves. This interaction is significant as astrophysical black holes are thought to be surrounded by an accretion disk of matter which, in particular, contains electromagnetic waves. The results of this work are shared with the mathematical and physical communities through peer-reviewed publications and seminars and disseminated to the general public through media articles, public lectures and outreach events in schools.

The investigator incorporates new techniques to obtain precise decay for the gravitational and electromagnetic waves on charged black holes by developing a universal method involving a combined energy-momentum tensor for coupled system of wave equations. The goal of the project is to prove the non-linear stability of the most general charged and rotating black hole family and extend the investigator?s collaborative work on the resolution for the Kerr family.

For example, one isoperimetric-type inequality gives the mathematical justification that a metal rod will have the strongest resistance to twisting forces if its cross-sections are circular. This project investigates several geometric questions related to isoperimetric and Sobolev-type inequalities, including the following: if one only has measurements of a given rod's resistance to twisting forces, how much geometric information can be recovered about the shape of the rod's cross-sections? Questions of this type have powerful and sometimes unexpected applications in other branches of mathematics. A fundamental part of the project is a two-pillared educational component. First, the Principal Investigator (PI) will organize a workshop for women in analysis at Carnegie Mellon University, integrating research and education through mini-courses, research talks, and opportunities for junior researchers.
