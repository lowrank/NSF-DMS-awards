Specifically, stable waves, bound to a position, are a central topic in the study of quantum materials.  Low-power transistors and small lasers are some of the devices that can be designed from quantum materials.  The critical mathematical tool for detecting these stable waves is called K-theory, a topic that cuts across many of the main subject areas of mathematics.  Using tools from operator algebras, a subfield of mathematical analysis, a form of K-theory has recently been discovered to be useful in the development of mathematical probes of computer models of materials.  Loring?s group will be developing the subject of K-theory for operator algebras, with particular emphasis on new mathematical techniques that can be implemented in software used by physicists.  This project will also create opportunities for students at the University of New Mexico and Florida A&M University to do research and participate in internships at Sandia National Laboratories.  <br/><br/><br/>The mathematics to be developed in this project will focus on multivariable spectrum for noncommuting operators and associated invariants in real and complex K-theory.  These invariants can be applied to detect local topology in a variety of quantum materials.  These invariants depend on a local gap in the Hamiltonian, a concept that can be made precise using the Clifford spectrum of the various position operators and the Hamiltonian.  Local gaps can exist in topological metals, and in composite systems where a metal lead abuts a topological insulator.  The fundamental challenge is to find invariants for matrix models of locally gapped free-fermion systems.  Using unsuspended E-theory as a model for real and complex K-homology, Loring will develop simple formulas for these invariants and determine if these invariants are complete.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fourier analysis studies the relation between a function and its Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a function, in rough terms, represents the function via a superposition of frequencies. Geometric measure theory studies the geometric properties of sets and measures under transformations. Fractal sets, or sets with highly irregular geometry, are of particular interest in this regard. Recently, the connection between Fourier analysis and geometric measure theory has led to substantial progress in both fields. This project explores the interaction between these two fields, along with possible applications to other fields such as dynamics and number theory. The project also supports workshops for graduate students and early-career mathematicians: these events will promote mathematical expertise within the indicated research areas, will contribute to the professional training of participants, and will foster new research collaborations.<br/><br/>The project combines work in restriction theory (within Fourier analysis) and the theory of projections (within geometric measure theory). One component of the planned research involves the study of the mass of a function, with Fourier transform supported on the sphere, on a fractal set.  Another component investigates the dimensions of fractal sets under certain linear or nonlinear maps parametrized by curved manifolds. A final component concerns the Kakeya conjecture, which asks how large must a set be if it contains a unit line segment in every direction. These three components, while distinct, are highly interrelated, and progress in each area is anticipated to inform ongoing work in all of these areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Free probability began as a subfield of the theory of von Neumann algebras, which in turn originated in a series of papers by Murray and von Neumann in the 1930s, as part of an effort to provide mathematical foundations for quantum mechanics.  A key concept in free probability is the notion of free independence, which generalizes the classical notion of independence of random variables, enabling the development of a robust ?noncommutative probability theory? in the setting of von Neumann algebras, where rich mathematical structure emerges from the interactions of objects known as free random variables (owing in part to the fact that their multiplication, like that of matrices of complex numbers, is not commutative).  Methods from free probability are now a cornerstone of the structure theory of certain von Neumann algebras, and have applications to a variety of other fields, including random matrix theory and quantum information theory.  In this project, the PI will study several important open problems on probability distributions of free random variables and explore their applications to random matrix models.  The project integrates research with education and will provide research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, complemented by outreach initiatives to teach and mentor middle school and high school students, with a particular emphasis on supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds.  <br/> <br/>The Brown measure of a free random variable is analogous to the eigenvalue counting measure of a square matrix. It is an extension of spectral measures of normal operators to non-normal operators. This measure encodes a great deal of information and can predict the limiting distributions of non-Hermitian random matrix models. In this project, the PI seeks to develop analytic techniques for computing the Brown measures of a diverse range of free random variables, motivated by operator algebras, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The boundary values of certain operator-valued subordination functions will be explored using tools in complex analysis, operator algebras, and noncommutative analysis. The project will investigate random variables formed through addition, multiplication, or polynomials of free random variables. The new Brown measure results will then be used to analyze limiting laws and the convergence of non-Hermitian random matrix models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many familiar functions are smooth, and smoothness properties are convenient and prevalent in scientific applications. However, non-smooth functions also frequently arise in mathematics and its applications, such as optimization. This project concerns differentiability phenomena in non-smooth environments. Specifically, it seeks to understand when non-smooth objects possess hidden smoothness structures. While non-smooth objects are more difficult to understand, they are often equipped with additional structure that is not initially visible. For instance, Lipschitz functions (i.e., those functions which expand distances by at most a multiplicative factor) are differentiable at most points of their domain. The project investigates these and related phenomena, it seeks to describe when a partially defined function can be extended to a smooth function, and explores when a function can be approximated by a smooth function. The project will promote research collaboration and will generate research training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The project centers on two broad topics of research. First, the PI seeks a deeper understanding of the Whitney extension and Lusin approximation questions for mappings between Carnot groups. A significant complication, not present in the Euclidean case, is that the maps to be constructed must satisfy nonlinear constraints reflecting the underlying geometry of these non-Euclidean environments. A second line of study investigates the differentiability properties of Lipschitz functions in Euclidean spaces, Carnot groups, and metric or Banach spaces. A fundamental theorem due to Rademacher states that every Lipschitz function defined in a Euclidean domain is differentiable almost everywhere. However, in many situations one in fact finds differentiability points inside measure zero sets. This observation led to the modern study of sets of universal differentiability. The project seeks to test the limits of Rademacher?s theorem through an improved understanding of universal differentiability sets, via the use of maximal directional derivatives and other methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis studies the behavior and regularity of functions defined on and taking values in spaces of complex numbers. It remains an indispensable tool across many domains in the sciences, engineering, and economics. This project considers the smoothness of transformations on a domain defined by complex valued functions when the domain is deformed. Using integral formulas, the PI will study how invariants of a domain vary when the underlying structure of the domain changes. Another component of the project involves the study of resonance. The PI will use small divisors that measure non-resonance to classify singularities of the complex structure arising in linear approximations of curved manifolds. The project will involve collaboration with researchers in an early career stage and will support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>Motivated by recent counterexamples showing that smooth families of domains may be equivalent by a discontinuous family of biholomorphisms, the PI will study the existence of families of biholomorphisms between families of domains using biholomorphism groups and other analytic tools such as Bergman metrics. The PI will construct a global homotopy formula with good estimates for suitable domains in a complex manifold. One of the goals is to construct a global formula in cases when a local homotopy formula fails to exist. The PI will use such global homotopy formulas to investigate the stability of holomorphic embeddings of domains with strongly pseudoconvex or concave boundary in a complex manifold, when the complex structure on the domains is deformed. The PI will use this approach to investigate stability of global Cauchy-Riemann structures on Cauchy-Riemann manifolds of higher codimension. The project seeks a holomorphic classification of neighborhoods of embeddings of a compact complex manifold in complex manifolds via the Levi-form and curvature of the normal bundle. In addition, the PI will study the classification of Cauchy-Riemann singularities for real manifolds using methods from several complex variables and small-divisor conditions in dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some well-known examples where wavelets are a key tool include the JPEG 2000 digital image standard and fingerprint compression for data storage. The broader impacts of the project deal with the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the area of harmonic analysis and wavelets.<br/><br/>The project aims to answer some of the most fundamental questions in wavelet and frame theory. One of the main research directions of the project is the development of techniques for the construction of well-localized orthogonal wavelets for large classes of non-isotropic expanding dilations.

Although a considerable body of theoretical knowledge is available, the transfer of that knowledge into applied disciplines remains underdeveloped. Two major types of activities are needed in order to effect such a transfer. First is the design of new theoretical models for observed phenomena, for which traditional (smooth) models either cannot be applied or fail to describe relevant features. Second is the development of tools to harvest these theoretical models for applications. In many cases, the fractal model is neither accessible to numerical methods nor useful to construct prototypes. Instead, one must rely on tractable, non-fractal approximations that capture essential features of the truly fractal model, buttressed by theoretical approximation results (e.g., spectral convergence, approximations by graphs or metric graphs) and suitable numerical methods (new specific domain decompositions and meshes, preconditioning techniques, robust and fast-converging schemes).

Other equations of interest describe the structure of geometric objects which locally minimize a suitable notion of area subject to predetermined constraints. Such objects arise classically in mathematical models for soap films. Prescribed curvature equations and the equations describing time-dependent curvature flow also find applications in mathematical physics, e.g., to the geometry of spacetime and to the deformation theory of elastic bodies.

In addition, the principal investigator will prepare publicly accessible educational materials through the writing of survey articles on the subject.<br/><br/>Two important types of nonlinear geometric partial differential equations feature heavily in this project: Lagrangian mean curvature equations (and the associated flows), and the Hamiltonian stationary equation (along with other fourth order equations of a similar type). Lagrangian mean curvature equations feature in the existence theory for special Lagrangian submanifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds, a central issue in mirror symmetry. The Hamiltonian stationary equation identifies critical points for the volume functional on Lagrangian submanifolds under Hamiltonian variations. A priori estimates are crucial for solving certain fully nonlinear equations and for determining fundamental properties of their solutions. Building on prior work in the complex Euclidean setting, the PI will investigate regularity and well-posedness of the variable Lagrangian phase function. In the Lagrangian context, variational problems for the volume functional lead to nonlinear equations of fourth order. A relevant challenge is to identify submanifolds that are minimal within a specific Hamiltonian isotopy class. In contrast with general minimal surfaces, the underlying constraints in this setting permit the existence of compact minimal submanifolds.

First, the investigator will use recently developed techniques for the study of degenerations of rational maps and a priori renormalization bounds to study boundedness questions in conformal dynamics. These methods suggest promising approaches to tackle longstanding conjectures about the boundaries of hyperbolic components for rational maps. Next, the investigator will extend the correspondence between rational maps and Kleinian groups. This extension yields novel hybrid dynamical systems combining rational maps and Kleinian groups, where renormalization and rescaling methods can be used to understand rigidity and the deformation spaces. Finally, the investigator will pursue a recently developed renormalization theory for infinite circle packings. These new techniques hold promise in solving various conjectures regarding the quasiconformal geometry of circle packings, thereby addressing some open questions about uniformization and offering insights into conjectures from geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specific questions to be investigated concern the inverse spectral problem, the structure of Laplacian eigenfunctions, and the asymptotic behavior of Bergman kernels. These topics are crucial for understanding how geometric structure influences spectral properties, and are deeply connected to various concepts in mathematics and mathematical physics. The inverse spectral problem investigates how much information about the shape of a (not necessarily round) drum can be obtained solely from its frequencies of vibration. This is a classical question famously popularized by Mark Kac with the phrase `Can one hear the shape of a drum?? A second set of problems focuses on the shape and the size of the set (`nodal set?) on which an eigenstate of the Laplacian operator vanishes. The size (in the sense of Hausdorff measure) of the nodal set is conjectured to be comparable to the frequency of the eigenstate. Finally, the Bergman kernel is an essential concept in the fields of complex analysis and complex geometry. Bergman kernel approximations arise naturally in mathematical physics, especially in string theory, where they have been proposed as a tool for the search for geometrically well-behaved complex metric structures. The broader impacts of the project contribute to education and diversity. The principal investigator actively supervises graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Additionally, the PI participates in outreach activities such as organizing math competitions for middle school students and mentoring students from diverse backgrounds through summer research programs.<br/><br/>The planned research lies in three main areas. Building on previous work with Steve Zelditch, in which nearly circular ellipses were shown to be spectrally unique among smooth domains, the PI aims to generalize such results to generic ellipses and to domains with constant width. Another direction of interest resides in strong inverse spectral results for generic polygons. Next, recent work by the PI resulted in new explicit upper bounds for the Hausdorff measure of nodal sets of eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds with Gevrey or quasianalytic regularity. The PI seeks to extend these results to manifolds with boundaries and to improve the current upper bounds using innovative methods. Finally, in collaboration with Hang Xu, the PI investigates asymptotic properties of Bergman kernels. This includes establishing new off-diagonal asymptotics for smooth Kaehler potentials and improving extant upper bounds for Bergman kernels. In addition, the PI will explore convergence properties of the Fefferman expansion for domains with real analytic boundaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elliptic differential equations are also used to quantify the degree to which physical objects are bent or distorted, with far-reaching implications and applications in geometry and topology. The proposed research focuses on the regularity of solutions to such equations. Questions to be addressed include the following: Do non-smooth points (singularities) exist? How large can the set of singularities be? What is the behavior of the solution near a singularity? Is it possible to perturb the underlying environment in order to eliminate the singularity? The project will also provide opportunities for the professional development of graduate students, both via individual mentoring and via the organization of a directed learning seminar on geometric analysis and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical objectives of the project are twofold. First, the principal investigator will study unique continuation for solutions to elliptic partial differential equations, with a focus on quantitative estimates on the size and structure of the singular set of these solutions. A second topic for consideration is the regularity theory for generalized minimal submanifolds (a generalized notion of smooth submanifolds which arise as critical points for the area functional under local deformations). In particular, the principal investigator will study branch singular points in the interior as well as at the boundary of a generalized minimal submanifold, under an area-minimizing or stability assumption.

In other words, the aim is to understand the processes through which a system's behavior evolves from periodicity toward chaos, as one or more governing parameters are varied. A related goal is to identify the primary bifurcation responsible for qualitative changes exhibited by a dynamical system. While such comprehension has previously been attained for low-dimensional dynamical systems, this project introduces a novel approach to transcend the low-dimensional limitation. The project will offer new conceptual ideas and approaches to provide fresh perspectives on advances in mathematics and science. Additionally, the project will facilitate the training of graduate students directly engaged in the research, and will afford educational opportunities to undergraduate students through the organization of a summer school presenting topics in mathematics, including topics related to dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems successfully explains the depth and complexity of chaotic phenomena in concert with a description of the dynamics of typical orbits for typical maps. Its remarkable universality properties supplement this understanding with powerful geometric tools. In the two-dimensional setting, the range of possible dynamical scenarios that can emerge is at present only partially understood, and a general framework for those new phenomena that do not occur for one-dimensional dynamics remains to be developed. In prior work supported by the NSF, the principal investigator introduced a large open class of two-dimensional dynamical systems, including the classical Henon family without the restriction of large area contraction, that is amenable to obtaining results as in the one-dimensional case. Moreover, major progress was reached to understand the transition from zero entropy to positive entropy using renormalization schemes. The present project has several components. First, existing renormalization schemes will be adapted to the positive entropy realm. Next, initial steps towards a characterization of dissipative diffeomorphisms in more general contexts will be addressed. Finally, the principal investigator will seek to develop the theory of differentiable renormalization without an a priori assumption of proximity to the one-dimensional setting. These results will open the door to a global description of dissipative diffeomorphisms and their behavior under perturbation, bringing both new tools and new perspectives to smooth dynamical systems theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conformal mappings are planar transformations which locally preserve angles. An important example is the Mercator projection in cartography, used to project the surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional map. More recently, much attention has been devoted to the study of quasiconformal mappings, a generalization of conformal mappings where a controlled amount of angle distortion is permitted. Because of this additional flexibility, quasiconformal mappings have proven over the years to be of fundamental importance in a wide variety of areas of mathematics and applications. Many of these applications involve planar transformations that are quasiconformal inside a given region except possibly for some exceptional set of points inside the region. The study of this exceptional set leads to the notion of removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex analysis, dynamical systems, probability and related areas. Another focus of this project is on the study of certain families of quasiconformal mappings called holomorphic motions. The principal investigator will study how quantities such as dimension and area change under holomorphic motions, leading to a better understanding of the geometric properties of quasiconformal mappings.

Self-similar sets are characterized by the property that they look the same at different scales.

On the other hand, in probability theory and statistical physics one often encounters stochastically self-similar sets. Such objects only have the same statistical properties at different scales. There are surprising analogies between the probabilistic theory and its deterministic counterpart. The research supported by this award explores these analogies and addresses foundational questions regarding self-similar objects, using methods from complex analysis.

A new parametrization of the Teichmueller spaces of punctured spheres will also be studied. Additional motivation for the project arises from the interaction between the deterministic and stochastic frameworks, notably, the transfer of methods and results between these two areas. For instance, the concept of conformal mating of polynomials in complex dynamics bears close similarity to Sheffield's mating of trees construction for random spheres. The PI?s research uses methods developed in complex dynamics to provide analytic constructions for random structures. Conversely, insights from the probabilistic theory translate to new research avenues in complex dynamics.

These fields are interrelated through both the methods used and in the fundamental questions of their study. The conference will bring together mathematicians from these fields ranging from senior experts to graduate students; experts will give standard 45?50-minute plenary lectures, and students will have the opportunity to give 5-10 minute ?lightning talks?. The conference will also include a career panel. More information on the conference, including a list of speakers, can be found on the conference website: https://pcallaart3.wixsite.com/conference.<br/> <br/>The fields represented in this conference have broad motivations and applications in several classical areas of mathematics and physics beyond dynamical systems and geometry, including number theory, probability theory, and statistical mechanics. Thermodynamic formalism is a framework for unifying many aspects of these fields, and its investigation triggers research and collaboration on the problem of the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states of the various systems studied in these fields. Limit sets of conformal dynamical systems, and in particular Julia sets arising in complex dynamics, are typically of a fractal nature and understanding their fine fractal properties such as Hausdorff, packing, Assouad and Fourier dimensions provides a true challenge for fractal geometers.

Transportation cost spaces, also known as Lipschitz-free spaces, Wasserstein spaces, Arens-Eals spaces,  and Earthmover spaces, have been used to model such problems. They can be viewed as a framework to study nonlinear metric spaces by embedding them isometrically and linearly densely into Banach spaces and provide powerful tools to study the nonlinear geometry of Banach spaces using well-known linear techniques for nonlinear problems. These spaces play a fundamental role in many areas of applied mathematics, engineering, physics, computer science, finance, and social sciences. Finding an optimal embedding is known to be a computationally hard problem and it has become a central problem in computer science to find low distortion embeddings. Using methods from the structure theory of Banach spaces and computational graph theory, the investigator?s goal is to achieve more precise estimates of these embeddings. He will obtain a deeper understanding of the structure of these spaces, which will result in several applications to the areas mentioned above. The principal investigator plans to organize conferences as well as mentor Ph.D. students as a part of this project. <br/><br/>A crucial connection exists between the L1-distortion of Transportation Cost Spaces and stochastic embeddings of the underlying metric space into trees.  The investigator will further study this connection to obtain lower and upper estimations on the distortion. The second part of the project  represents a contribution to Lindenstrauss?s program in determining Banach spaces that are primary, and that cannot be decomposed into essentially different subspaces.

This research is divided into two themes: low dimensional topology and operator K-theory. In both fields, the aforementioned analytic tools are used to build invariants to study the geometric structure of manifolds, which are spaces modelled on Euclidean spaces, like the 3-dimensional space we live in. In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them. These questions have a wide range of applications in biology and physics. The educational and outreach goals of this project involve math and general STEM enrichment programs at the middle and high school levels, with a focus on programs aimed at students from underserved communities and underrepresented groups, as well as mentorship in research at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>In low dimensional topology, this project focuses on furthering our understanding of instanton and monopole Floer homologies and their relation to Khovanov homology, and using this to study existence questions of families of metrics with positive scalar curvature on manifolds, as well as questions about knot concordance. Separately this project also involves computationally studying knot concordance, both by a computer search for concordances and by computationally studying certain local equivalence and almost local equivalence groups that receive homomorphisms from the knot concordance groups. In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal of the project is to discover new underlying principles and general methods to understand the properties of solutions of the PDE under investigation. A key object of the research is a crystal growth model in which the crystal grows in both the horizontal direction, by adatoms, and the vertical direction, by dislocations or nucleation in a supersaturated media.

The second involves level-set mean curvature flow equations with driving and source terms and applications in crystal growths and turbulent combustions. The focus is on the regularity, the large-time average, and the large-time behavior of the solutions.

For instance, we routinely measure the pressure and the temperature of the air in the Earth?s atmosphere, and such measurements depend upon the time and the location of the device used. Several fundamental laws discovered by scientists during the last three centuries give relations among the rates of change of such physical quantities and the resulting mathematical objects, called partial differential equations, are therefore ubiquitous in modern science and engineering. The partial differential equations describing the motion of incompressible, viscous and ideal fluids date back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Nonetheless, a rigorous mathematical understanding of many properties of their solutions is still lacking and some reverberates in a poor understanding of certain fundamental phenomena. A pivotal example is the apparent incompatibility of the classical mathematical treatment of these equations with the basic observation in the theory of fully developed turbulence that, in the limit of the viscosity of the fluid tending to zero, turbulent flows dissipate kinetic energy. In fact, regular solutions of the equations describing the zero-viscosity limit can be proved to conserve the kinetic energy and are therefore at odds with the latter phenomenon. Starting from the latter problem as a pivotal one, this project aims to advance our understanding of other basic properties of solutions, such as regularity, uniqueness, and stability. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and supports the engagement of the principal investigator in popularizing mathematics to the general public.<br/><br/>The project investigates two fundamental questions in incompressible fluid dynamics. The first goal is to find rigorous examples of the so-called ""zero law of fully developed turbulence"", namely the presence of anomalous dissipation in the zero-viscosity limit. The ideal solution of the latter problem is to give a proof of existence of a sequence of solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with vanishing viscosity for which the dissipation rate of kinetic energy stays positive in the limit, without the introduction of spurious oscillations in the initial data. The second is the investigation of blow-up scenarios for smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. Both problems are formidable, and they have defied the efforts of mathematicians for decades. Given the size of the challenge, some effort will be dedicated to the investigation of simpler situations. An important example in the case of anomalous dissipation is the effect of forcing terms in the equations. An example in the case of the blow-up problem is understanding suitable deformations of the Navier-Stokes equations which embeds them in a higher parameter family of equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, the physical relevance and the validity of these ideal models are established through the comparison between the results from theoretical analysis and the experimental observations. On the other hand, once the meaningfulness of a mathematical model is supported by available experimental data to certain extent, the theoretical studies on these ideal models can provide properties and predictions of the original physical problems that are difficult to obtain from experiments. For physical systems involving temporal evolution, of particular interest are certain structural and asymptotic properties. These include special structures, such as equilibria, periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, chaotic orbits, and their qualitative properties like stability or asymptotic stability. In general, on the one hand, only stable states are physically observable in a system, while the ideal, but unstable, states are hardly observed due to their extremely sensitive dependence on the parameters. On the other hand, unstable states are also very important, in part because they and some of their associated structures serve as the boundaries separating different collections of stable states in a system. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) plans to focus on the local dynamics near steady states in several classical nonlinear PDE systems which belong to the general category of nonlinear waves and incompressible fluids. The complicated nonlinearity poses tremendous challenges in their mathematical analysis. A substantial part of the project is suitable for graduate students and postdocs and provides research training opportunities for these early-career mathematicians.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will study the dynamics of incompressible fluid PDE (inviscid, weakly viscous, or with density stratification) with free surfaces as well as a class of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE. They are standard models arising in fluids, atmosphere-oceans, nonlinear waves, etc. Their solution flows generate infinite dimensional dynamical systems in function spaces. There has been extensive research on these systems with many important advances in recent years. However, due to the complicated spectra of the linearized problems, the highly nonlinear nature, regularity issues, and the multiple scales in space and time they involve, many questions, including some fundamental ones, are still not well understood. First, the PI will work on the two-dimensional water waves linearized at shear flows, including the bifurcation of instability and the linear inviscid damping for the gravity water waves and the spectra and linear flows of the stratified water waves. The second focus of the project is the nonlinear local dynamics of a class of Hamiltonian PDE including the local invariant manifolds for quasilinear Hamiltonian PDE, where the regularity issue poses a major challenge, and the unfolding bifurcation of small homoclinic type solutions in a singular perturbation framework. The PI will also study a potential flow approximation to weakly viscous water waves including formal justification via detailed multi-scale expansions involving boundary layers followed by rigorous proofs. Understanding and solving these problems, expected to be largely based on their specific mechanical and geometric structures, would result in substantial theoretical advances in these areas and possibly lead to the discovery of new physical and mathematical phenomena in the underlying systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical laws are usually described mathematically by differential equations.  Over the last half century, a comprehensive theory of differential equations with random noise, called stochastic differential equations, has been developed and is very well-understood in many regimes.  One area where foundational work is still needed is understanding how the behavior of systems described by stochastic differential equations scales as the dimension, i.e. the number of features in the system, grows.  This project aims to provide a broad theoretical framework and a general scaling limit theory for high-dimensional stochastic differential equations.  This theory will have significant applications to research fields as diverse as deep learning and neural networks, neurobiology (understanding learning structures in the brains of insects and other animals), the design of broadband wireless networks, and theoretical physics (quantum field theory).

Noncommutative stochastic calculus has been developed in several quarters since the 1980s, but key analytic features of the classical theory have been missed owing to the noncommutativity - often, the methods are combinatorial, and function classes are restricted to polynomials or analytic functions. Current work has developed a new approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus, using noncommutative function theory which mirrors the classical martingale theoretic approach. This yields a general theory of noncommutative quadratic variation and an Ito formula which extends all previously known Ito formulations in free probability.  This project will use these tools to study the large-N limits of NxN matrix SDEs, proving a general scaling limit for their solutions as described by noncommutative SDEs in free probability.   The outline of this approach for self-adjoint processes is now clear, and the technical difficulties should be approachable with methods described above.

This is particularly important for real-time systems (flight control systems, medical devices, smartphones, sensors, etc.) where numerical calculations need to be performed as quickly as possible. Polynomials play a crucial role in constructing such approximations. They are used across many fields due to their versatility in simplifying complex functions and providing accurate estimations.

The first part of the project explores constructive polynomial approximation schemes in weighted Dirichlet and in de Branges--Rovnyak spaces by re-framing the approximation problem as concrete matrix and operator theory problems. The second part of the project focuses on determining general conditions guaranteeing well-known approximation schemes (Cesaro, Abel, etc.) converge in general Banach holomorphic function spaces. The classical approximation property (AP) of Banach spaces plays a crucial role in this problem. Of particular interest is how strengthened versions of the AP can be used to characterize the existence of specific approximation schemes.

The conference, called ""PDE in Moab: Advances in Theory and Application"" will feature 14 invited talks, along with 9 contributed talks from early career mathematicians, with a total of approximately 40 participants. Funding attached to this grant will be used to support travel and lodging expenses for participants in the conference, with priority for junior participants who do not have access to other sources of travel funding. The conference website is https://pdemoab.byu.edu<br/><br/>This conference aims to explore the tools and methods of partial differential equations (PDE), and their applications in related fields such as geometric measure theory (GMT), harmonic analysis, and free boundary problems. Historically, these areas of mathematics have benefited from many fruitful interconnections. Indeed, pioneering advancements in free boundary problems adapted techniques from regularity theory in both PDE and GMT. Moreover, recent advances in both nonlinear and nonlocal PDE have enlarged the intersection of the aforementioned fields, thereby increasing interactions, collaborations, and the overall advancement of these areas.  This conference will bring together experts from the areas of PDE, GMT, harmonic analysis, and free boundary problems to explore and build on recent progress. The list of speakers is comprised of a dynamic group of mathematicians specializing in complementary fields, many of whom already have intersecting interests. It is expected that by bringing these researchers together, there will be further interaction between research areas, leading to the cross-pollination of techniques and novel research results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Partial differential equations provide a powerful mathematical tool to gain insights about equilibrium states of complex physical systems which arise as solutions of certain equations.  The properties of the solutions to these equations depend on a ?background geometry? that models physical features such as the non-homogeneity of materials or the presence of constraints (such as the constraints inherent in the motion of a robotic arm).  In many important physical applications, one encounters non-smooth geometries (for instance, fractals) which differ fundamentally from the familiar geometry of Euclidean space, so that standard notions from calculus must be reformulated from a broader perspective.  One of the most ubiquitous instances of such ?background geometry? is known as sub-Riemannian geometry, which models spaces in which motion is possible only along a given set of directions.  This non-smooth geometry is widely useful in modeling physical phenomena, for example, in robotics, quantum mechanics, and neuroscience.  This project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on research projects arising from the proposed work.  <br/><br/>The PI will study sub-Riemannian analogues of the curve shortening flow; the regularity of solutions of certain degenerate elliptic parabolic PDE and non-local PDE in the general setting of certain metric spaces endowed with a doubling measure. The common thread between these investigations is the interplay between the non-smooth structure of the space and the behavior of solutions of equations describing critical points of interesting energy functionals. Some of the proposed research will provide a theoretical basis for implementing numerical simulations of real-world systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, the investigator organizes a week-long mathematics workshop focused on first-generation freshmen and sophomore students, addressing a large group that is severely underserved. The students participate in minicourses, attend research talks, and have informal conversations with mathematicians who work in different sectors. The workshop is designed to maximize the chance of success of these students, promoting the progress of science and contributing to the development of a mathematically well-versed and diverse workforce.

Free boundaries often appear in the applied sciences, in situations where the solution to a problem consists of a pair: a function (often satisfying a PDE), and a set related to this function. The main questions investigated by this project are related to the regularity of the function and the geometry of the associated set. The investigator answers these questions for problems modeled by nonlocal equations, almost minimizers with free boundaries, and minimizers for anisotropic energies. The first class of problems involves PDE which have fundamental importance for mathematical modeling. In particular, numerous applied phenomena give rise to nonlocal equations, such as nonlocal image processing and liquid crystals. In this part of the project, the investigator develops a technique to obtain results for parabolic, nonlocal equations, from their elliptic counterparts. Secondly, the study of almost minimizers with free boundaries has outstanding potential to treat a new group of physically motivated problems, as the almost minimizing property can be understood as a minimizing problem with noise.

Both have proved to be very effective in understanding a variety of physical phenomena and have wide applications in engineering and the natural sciences. Partial differential equations are a natural way to model dynamic processes (that is, processes that evolve or change in some way). Harmonic analysis provides both a firm theoretical foundation on which to construct these models and effective tools for analyzing their behavior. One of the main goals of this research is to expand our knowledge of harmonic analysis and its applications to the study of partial differential equations. Significant parts of this project include education and mentoring of graduate students, particularly women and under-represented minorities, and the development of new international research collaborations. <br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) is working on two projects in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. In the first, the PI is studying matrix weighted estimates for singular and fractional integrals. He is proving generalizations of the Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem in this setting and developing a theory of matrix weighted Hardy spaces and matrix weighted variable Lebesgue spaces. These results generalize the extensive literature on scalar weighted inequalities and highlight the differences between scalar and matrix weights. New techniques involving convex-set valued functions are used to overcome various technical obstacles that arise in the passage from scalar to matrix weights. In the second project, the PI is studying the existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of solutions of second order, degenerate elliptic equations with lower order terms. The goal is to construct a theory on as general an equation as possible with the fewest assumptions on the coefficients and the region. These assumptions are expressed in terms of the existence of matrix weighted Sobolev and Poincare ? inequalities.

Because these systems are inherently difficult to predict, they are often studied from a statistical point of view, that is, one analyzes the properties of the system that are expressed through various types of average.  This is the focus of ergodic theory, a subfield of dynamical systems, and the conceptual framework for this project, in which the PI will investigate the statistical properties of systems with different types of hyperbolicity.

Previously, the PI used measure rigidity results to identify new open sets of dynamical systems with a unique physical measure. The first part of the project aims to address questions related to the utilization of quantified non-joint integrability in establishing the existence and finiteness of physical measures, as well as to understand how often these conditions occur in the partially hyperbolic setting. In the second part of the project, the PI and his co-authors aim to understand different types of transversality to obtain absolute continuity of stationary measures for certain types of random products of surface diffeomorphisms. One goal of this part is to obtain a Benoist-Quint type of result in a non-homogeneous setting.

The most natural dynamical system in geometry is the geodesic flow: given an initial position and direction, a particle flows at unit speed along the path that locally minimizes distance.  This flow has special importance because of its relationship with the geometry and topology of the underlying space. The shape of the space will often produce geodesic flows with interesting dynamical behavior.  Consider, for example, a torus with more than one hole, which can be visualized as a pretzel.  Paths in the torus that start close together will usually separate and follow different and unpredictable trajectories around the holes.  Typically, such trajectories will eventually look independent of the way they started.  This is a model situation in which the dynamics and geometry can be understood using tools of ergodic theory.  The PI will pursue research on ergodic geometry in two main directions which take advantage of the interplay between geometric and dynamical techniques.  In one direction, the PI studies a variety of new problems in the geodesic flow setting that have become tractable due to recent advances in the state-of-the-art. In another direction, the PI expands on this approach by implementing the ideas of ergodic geometry in a broader class of smooth dynamical systems beyond geodesic flows.  This award will also support the training of graduate students, and the participation of undergraduate students in the Ohio State REU program in dynamical systems.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>This project has three parts.

Complex dynamics has strong analogies with the theory of geodesic flows in negative curvature, and the PI furthers the analogy by importing some novel ideas to that setting.  The third part of the project will involve the development of symbolic dynamics for non-compact geodesic flows on manifolds in dimensions 3 and higher.

For instance, most of the matter that surrounds us is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These building blocks, taken individually, are rather simple, but, when enough of them interact with each other, they produce complex and varied structures, from the intricate patterns of tiny snowflakes to enormous spiraling galaxies. This is a very powerful idea: in principle, it suffices to understand the behavior of simple particles to derive everything. However, in practice, this is a very challenging task, as keeping track of large numbers of interacting particles is impossibly difficult. Instead, sophisticated techniques need to be developed to extract the relevant collective behaviors. This project consists in developing and investigating several such techniques. This project focuses on three types of particle systems, both classical and quantum, which exhibit different types of collective behavior. The first is a model of interacting quantum particles called Bosons. This is a toy model for helium atoms, which are known to form a superfluid phase at low temperature, in which the helium flows without viscosity. The principal investigator (PI) is studying the so-called ""Simplified Approach"", which has been shown to reproduce much of the complex behavior of the interacting Bose gas, while being much more tractable. The second is a classical model in which the PI is proving the existence of crystalline phases, in which infinite large-scale regular patterns spontaneously emerge. The third is a model of interacting quantum particles called Fermions. This is a toy model for the electrons in conductors, which are known to form a superconducting phase at low temperature, in which electricity flows without resistance. The PI is investigating ""hierarchical models"", for which exact solutions can be found, and complex behavior can be proved. This project includes a significant educational component at various levels. The PI is developing graduate, undergraduate, and master's level courses that incorporate the techniques developed in the project, thus introducing students to the tools and techniques of mathematical research. In addition, the PI is producing and distributing educational videos aimed at high school students, undergraduates, and the general public, which are informed by the PI's perspective as a researcher. In addition, the PI is involved in a project to design new mathematical reasoning courses at Rutgers, based on the formal proof assistant called ""Lean"".<br/><br/>This project lies in the field of mathematical physics and aims to develop new tools and refine existing ones to analyze the effect of interactions in a systematic and mathematically rigorous way. Specifically, it consists of the analysis of three types of systems: interacting Bose gases, classical hard-core particle models at high density, and interacting lattice Fermi gases. To analyze the interacting Bose gas, the PI is investigating the ""Simplified Approach"", which is a nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equation (PDE) in three dimensions. Its analysis has yielded very promising results: it reproduces all known and conjectured behavior of the Bose gas for all densities. The objectives of this part are to solve the more important problems that are still open about this PDE and study its relation to the original many-Boson problem. The PI has developed a framework to study a large class of hard-core particle models at high density and prove that these behave like crystals in that regime. The objectives of this part are to extend the family of hard-core particle models for which we can rigorously prove ordering phase transitions to include three dimensional models, liquid crystals, as well as continuum models. To study interacting lattice Fermi gases, the PI is using the Renormalization Group (RG), which is a powerful tool to study systems of interacting quantum particles, but it is notoriously difficult to implement. The PI has introduced a family of models for which the RG analysis can be carried out easily, rigorously, and exactly, and nontrivial properties can be proved. The main objective of this part is to define and study Fermionic hierarchical models that exhibit superconductivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former compares geometric measurements (such as volume and surface area) while the latter recovers the shape of geometric figures using local versions of these measurements. The two types of problems are inherently connected. This project will exploit this connection to seek answers to either isoperimetric problems or Minkowski problems in various settings when answers to one exist while answers to the other remain elusive. Although these problems originate from a geometric background, their applications extend beyond mathematics into engineering and design, including areas like antenna reflector design and urban planning. The principal investigator will organize a series of events and workshops at local science museums, community centers, and schools, involving high school teachers and students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. These events and workshops aim to expose the fun and exploratory side of the principal investigator?s research and mathematics in general to students early in their educational careers, raise society's awareness and interest in mathematics, and promote mathematics among historically underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The existence of solutions to the dual Minkowski problem (that characterizes dual curvature measures)  in the original symmetric case has been largely settled (by the principal investigator and his collaborators) through techniques from geometry and analysis. This naturally leads to conjectures involving isoperimetric problems connected to the dual Minkowski problem. Such conjectured isoperimetric inequalities are also connected to an intriguing question behind many other conjectures in convexity: how does certain symmetry improve estimates? The principal investigator will also study Minkowski problems and isoperimetric inequalities coming from affine geometry. Special cases of these isoperimetric inequalities are connected to an affine version of the sharp fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren-Lieb. The techniques involved in studying these questions are from Convex Geometric Analysis and PDE. In the last few decades (particularly the last two), there has been a community-wide effort to extend results in the theory of convex bodies to their counterparts in the space of log-concave functions. In this project, the principal investigator will also continue his past work to extend dual curvature measures, their Minkowski problems, and associated isoperimetric inequality to the space of log-concave functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Time-frequency analysis originates in signal processing and considers the properties of a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously. Historically, the development of time-frequency analysis was motivated in quantum mechanics (e.g. the celebrated Heisenberg uncertainty principle and related work of Wigner and Gabor) and radar detection. Modern applications relying on time-frequency techniques include areas such as image sampling, satellite transmission/GPS location and biomedicine. The PI will continue the development of powerful analytical methods to advance time-frequency analysis from a theoretical perspective. The PI will organize a series of educational activities that include outreach and mentoring for high school and undergraduate students, Putnam exam preparation, reading-course offerings, supervision of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and co-organization of seminars, conferences, and summer schools. <br/><br/>This project involves important problems in harmonic analysis with connections to additive combinatorics, ergodic theory and PDE. Relying on time-frequency analysis, the main focus is on the interplay between non-zero and zero curvature settings, with special attention paid to hybrid situations that encapsulate features from both extremes of the scale. The main themes include: (I) Multilinear maximal/singular/oscillatory operators: Building on a natural hierarchical structure that includes the Carleson operator and the bilinear Hilbert transform, this topic studies several relevant model problems in connection to two celebrated open questions: (a) the behavior of the pointwise convergence of bilinear Fourier series, and (b) the boundedness properties of the trilinear Hilbert transform. (II) Multidimensional maximal/singular/oscillatory operators along variable curves: This theme focuses on Carleson-Radon type behavior as well as on an array of problems related to Zygmund's differentiation conjecture. The crucial difficulty here lies in the multivariable dependence of the curves involved in the representation of the operators under study. This creates a series of new difficulties in part due to the existence of Kakeya/Besicovitch type phenomena. (III) Pointwise convergence of Fourier Series, end-point behavior: This topic revolves around the century-old problem regarding the behavior of Fourier Series and discusses some long-standing conjectures on which the investigator has made relevant progress.

The mathematical field of dynamical systems concerns the evolution of systems over time, including real-world systems such as the weather, traffic patterns, and planetary systems.  Some of the most important examples exhibit chaotic behavior. Parabolic dynamics encompasses one class of dynamical systems with chaotic behavior, and renormalization is a powerful tool for uncovering its properties. This conference seeks to bring leading international researchers together to discuss systems that extend beyond parabolic systems and understand techniques that would expand the scope of renormalization and discover new techniques for studying such systems.<br/><br/>Examples of parabolic dynamical systems include horocycle flows on hyperbolic surfaces and, more generally, unipotent flows in homogeneous dynamics, smooth area-preserving flows on surfaces, and nilflows on nilmanifolds. If we allow for the presence of singularities, it also encompasses the study of interval exchange transformations (IETs) and translation flows. More recently, another example that has attracted a lot of attention is the horocycle flow in the moduli space of translation surfaces. Many important examples of parabolic flows also arise from models in mathematical physics, such as the Ehrenfest model of Lorentz gases, systems of Eaton lenses, and the Novikov model, leading to flows on Fermi energy level surfaces in solid-state physics. A key technique used to study parabolic systems is renormalization, an idea that originated from physics, entered dynamical systems decades ago, and has become an increasingly powerful tool for understanding the long-term behavior of many classes of parabolic dynamical systems. This conference seeks to bring together leading researchers from around the world to share their recent advances with the community, which would include US-based graduate students and postdocs.

The theory of operator algebras began in the 1930s with the goal of creating a mathematically rigorous foundation for Heisenberg's approach to quantum mechanics.  In Heisenberg's work, observable physical quantities are represented by certain linear operators on Hilbert space (roughly, infinite matrices of complex numbers).  One of the most famous results of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that the momentum and position of a particle cannot be known simultaneously.  The mathematically rigorous version of this statement is that the operators P and Q which measure position and momentum do not commute, i.e., PQ and QP are not equal (there is, however, a precise formula relating P and Q).  Operator algebras is the study of algebraic relations between collections of operators.  Amenable C*-algebras form a particularly important class of operator algebras.  A large-scale effort over the last several decades has shown that, under relatively mild (though still somewhat mysterious) additional hypotheses, the simple (i.e., indecomposable) amenable C*-algebras can be completely classified.  The main goals of this project are to further examine the extra conditions needed for classification, with a view toward more powerful classification results, and to study of the finer structure of the classifiable operator algebras, including their symmetries.  The project will also enhance the mathematics workforce through research opportunities for graduate students, instructional workshops and seminars, and expository material on the main topics of research.<br/><br/><br/>Recent progress in Elliott's Program has shown that separable, simple, nuclear, Z-stable C*-algebras in the UCT class are classified up to isomorphism via their operator K-theory groups, their trace simplex, and the pairing between them.  The Z-stability condition is known to be necessary and is currently the most difficult hypothesis to verify in practice.  The Toms-Winter conjecture predicts that under the other hypothesis, Z-stability follows from an a priori weaker condition known as strict comparison.  Part of the goal of the project is to examine this conjecture.  It is a long-standing open question if every separable nuclear C*-algebra satisfies the UCT.  While the UCT condition is usually easily verified in concrete examples (through a series of deep results in operator K-theory), the UCT continues to be a significant theoretical barrier.  This project will examine the possibility of obtaining classification results without a UCT assumption, at the expense of augmenting the Elliott invariant with KK-theoretic data.  Such classification results without the UCT will be crucial in advancing the structure and classification theory of non-simple nuclear C*-algebras and of group actions on (simple) nuclear C*-algebras.  Indeed, all prior works in this direction suggests that variants of KK-theory accounting for the ideal structure and/or the group action on the C*-algebra will be necessary, and even in most concrete examples, there are no satisfactory analogues of the UCT which account for this extra structure on KK-theory.  It will thus be necessary to work with KK-theory more directly than has been done previously in the (stably finite) classification theory.  Progress in this direction will set the stage for the next stages in the structure and classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras and group actions on such C*-algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding stability of black holes has been central to the mathematical endeavor of confirming their relevance as realistic physical objects. If stable, black holes perturbed with gravitational or other form of radiation, after a temporary change, would eventually return to their initial state. The investigator aims to advance the current knowledge of perturbations dynamics by including interaction of electromagnetic radiation with gravitational waves. This interaction is significant as astrophysical black holes are thought to be surrounded by an accretion disk of matter which, in particular, contains electromagnetic waves. The results of this work are shared with the mathematical and physical communities through peer-reviewed publications and seminars and disseminated to the general public through media articles, public lectures and outreach events in schools. The research of the investigator is integrated with educational activities that increase representation of women in mathematics and promote engagement in mathematics among students. Graduate students and postdocs are also to be involved in this research.<br/> <br/>The project is focused on building a comprehensive approach to analyze interactions between gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation on rotating and charged black holes. The investigator incorporates new techniques to obtain precise decay for the gravitational and electromagnetic waves on charged black holes by developing a universal method involving a combined energy-momentum tensor for coupled system of wave equations. The goal of the project is to prove the non-linear stability of the most general charged and rotating black hole family and extend the investigator?s collaborative work on the resolution for the Kerr family. In addition, the investigator aims to obtain conservation laws for charged black holes in connection with their canonical energy while allowing control of the gravitational and electromagnetic energy radiated at infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The annual conference series, which began in 2016 at Michigan State, focuses on early-career mathematicians working in mathematical physics.  Each meeting features invited talks by experts in the field, a minicourse on a topic in mathematical physics, contributed talks by participants, and an interactive career development panel. The main goals of the GLaMP series are: 1) to provide a forum for early-career researchers in mathematical physics ? including advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career postdoctoral scholars ? to present their research and enhance their career development; 2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in mathematical physics throughout the United States and, in particular, in the greater Midwest; 3) to encourage participation by women and underrepresented minorities in the field of mathematical physics; and 4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States.

The field is supported by the International Association of Mathematical Physics, which organizes an international congress every three years. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in the US. The GLaMP meetings have evolved to be the main annual meetings focused on mathematical physics in the US.

Simple C*-algebras are those that cannot be broken apart into smaller (""simpler"") C*-algebras. The largest part of this project is about when a simple C*-algebra is isomorphic to its opposite algebra, that is, mathematically the same as what might be thought of as its mirror image. For an example from everyday life, an ordinary sock is the same as its mirror image, since a sock which fits on a right foot will fit equally well on the left foot. A glove isn't like that: whatever one does, a right glove will not fit on a left hand. A nonsimple C*-algebra can be made of very elementary parts, but put together in a tricky way, so as to not be isomorphic to its opposite. Simple C*-algebras which are not separable or not nuclear (""too large"", but in different senses) can also fail to be isomorphic to their opposites. On the other hand, simple C*-algebras covered by the Elliott classification program are isomorphic to their opposites. A long-term goal of the project is to exhibit a simple separable nuclear C*-algebra which is not isomorphic to its opposite. Such an algebra could not be covered even by any proposed expansion of the Elliott program. The project will also contribute to US workforce development through the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The intended example is a simple unital AH algebra with fast dimension growth. The intended proof that it is not isomorphic to its opposite depends on nonexistence theorems for certain homomorphisms from one matrix algebra over the algebra of continuous functions on a compact space to a different matrix algebra over the continuous functions on a different compact space. When the second matrix size is large enough, all homomorphisms not ruled out for fairly obvious reasons actually exist. When it is small, known obstructions rule out most homomorphisms. The application requires information about an intermediate range. Here, even the simplest case, asked by Blackadar over 30 years ago, remains open; understanding this case is a necessary preliminary step. This case can almost certainly be settled by computations in rational homotopy theory, a new use of algebraic topology in C*-algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivation to study these questions can be found in partial differential equations, which are fundamental to the study of science and engineering. The solution to a partial differential equation is frequently given by an integral operator, a Calderon-Zygmund operator, whose related properties can be used to deduce related properties of these partial differential equations. In general, studying these Calderon-Zygmund operators is challenging and one seeks to study their action on certain spaces of functions, by checking the behavior only on a simpler class of test functions. In analogy, this can be seen as attempting to understand a complicated musical score by simply understanding a simpler finite collection of pure frequencies. The proposed research is based on recent contributions made by the PI, leveraging the skills and knowledge developed through prior National Science Foundation awards. Through this proposal the PI will address open and important questions at the interface of analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  Resolution of questions in these areas will provide for additional lines of inquiry.  Funds from this award will support a diverse group of graduate students whom the PI advises; helping to increase the national pipeline of well-trained STEM students for careers in academia, government, or industry.<br/><br/>The research program of this proposal couples important open questions with the PI's past work.  The general theme will be to use methods around ``testing theorems,'' called ``T1 theorems'' in harmonic analysis or the ``reproducing kernel thesis'' in analytic function theory and operator theory, to study questions that arise in analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  In particular, applications of the proof strategy of testing theorems will: (1) be used to characterize when Calderon-Zygmund operators are bounded between weighted spaces both for continuous and dyadic variants of these operators; (2) serve as motivation for a class of questions related to operators on the Fock space of analytic functions that are intimately connected to Calderon-Zygmund operators; and, (3) be leveraged to provide a method to study Carleson measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions.

While this tool was initially intended to analyze differential equations that describe wave cancellations, it has also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. For example, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers. They are used to generate scrambling and diffusion keys, which are instrumental in encrypting data. Mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner. But we can think of numbers as frequencies and thus associate them with waves.  In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. This was the case with PI's breakthrough resolution of the Main Conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem. The PI plans to further extend the scope of decoupling toward the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and number theory.  He will seek to make the new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Part of this project is aimed at developing the methodology to analyze the Schrödinger maximal function in the periodic setting. Building on his recent progress, the PI aims to incorporate Fourier analysis and more delicate number theory into the existing combinatorial framework. Decouplings have proved successful in addressing a wide range of problems in such diverse areas as number theory, partial differential equations, and harmonic analysis. The current project seeks to further expand the applicability of this method in new directions. One of them is concerned with finding sharp estimates for the Fourier transforms of fractal measures supported on curved manifolds. The PI seeks to combine decoupling with sharp estimates for incidences between balls and tubes. In yet another direction, he plans to further investigate the newly introduced tight decoupling phenomenon. This has deep connections to both number theory and the Lambda(p) estimates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The settings for these problems involve geometric manifolds of dimension two or more.  Associated with a given manifold are fundamental objects called eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits, as well as the sound volume.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and the PI will study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the properties properties of eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the PI will study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Among the specific problems the PI shall study, they wish to obtain improved estimates that measure the size and concentration of eigenfunctions.  In order to do this, they will develop what is called ``global harmonic analysis??, which is a mixture of classical harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis, and techniques from geometry.  The basic estimates are Lp-estimates for eigenfunctions and quasimodes and related highly localized L2 estimates that are sensitive to concentration.  The main questions center around how the geometry and the global dynamics of the geodesic flow affect the estimates and the kinds of functions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much-studied (but still not well-understood) questions of concentration, oscillation, and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  These questions are also naturally linked to the long-time properties of the solution operator for the wave equation, Schrodinger equation, and resolvent estimates coming from the metric Laplacian.  High frequency solutions and obtaining sharp results under geometric assumptions are particularly interesting.  They will also study functions that saturate the estimates in different ways depending on the sign of the sectional curvatures of the manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In other words, operations typically do not commute; this is why matrices, which encode noncommutativity in mathematics, are omnipresent in science. While matrix and operator theory has been profoundly developed in the past, the fast-evolving technological advances raise new challenges that have to be addressed. Concretely, expanding quantum technologies, complex control systems, and new resources in optimization and computability pose questions about ensembles of matrices and their features that are independent of the matrix size. The common framework for studying such problems is provided by free analysis (""free"" as in size-free), which investigates functions in matrix and operator variables. This project focuses on such functions that are built only using variables and arithmetic operations, and are therefore called noncommutative polynomials and rational functions. While these are more tangible and computationally accessible than general noncommutative functions, most of their fundamental features are yet to be explored. The scope of the project is to investigate noncommutative rational functions and their variations, develop a theory that allows resolving open problems about them, and finally apply these resolutions to tackle emerging challenges in optimization, control systems, and quantum information. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The scope of this project is twofold. Firstly, the project aims to answer several function-theoretic open problems on rational operations in noncommuting variables. Among these are singularities and vanishing of rational expressions in bounded operator variables, geometric and structural detection of composition in noncommutative rational functions using control-theoretic tools, noncommutative tensor-rational functions and their role in computational complexity, and existence of low-rank values of noncommutative polynomials with a view towards noncommutative algebraic geometry and approximate zero sets. These fundamental problems call for new synergistic methods that combine complex analysis, representation theory, algebraic geometry and operator theory. Secondly, the project aims to advance the framework of positivity and optimization in several operator variables without dimension restrictions, where the objective functions and constraints are noncommutative polynomials and their variations. The approach to this goal leads through functional analysis, real algebraic geometry and operator algebras. Moreover, the project seeks to apply these new optimization algorithms in quantum information theory, to study nonlinear Bell inequalities in complex quantum networks and the self-testing phenomenon in device-independent certification and cryptographic security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In classical mechanics it is possible to simultaneously observe and measure various properties of a physical system ? for example, the locations and velocities of all of its components. Such properties are often called observables.  Observables be viewed as functions of the underlying system and form an algebra ? they can be added and multiplied.   In quantum mechanics, simultaneous measurements are no longer possible. Mathematically this is reflected by the non-commutativity of the algebra of observables for quantum systems. Nonetheless, many of the operations that can be done with ordinary functions have quantum analogs.  The current proposal studies such non-commutative algebras of observables from the angle of Voiculescu?s free probability theory, which treats observables as random variables. This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations and Brownian motion, amenable to analysis by techniques inspired by classical information theory.  This project will promote human resource development through graduate and undergraduate research opportunities and will support students under the auspices of the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle.  <br/><br/>The proposed research deals with several questions in von Neumann algebras which are approached by free probability and free information methods, including free entropy theory.

Research in dynamical systems is often focused on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained.  In many modeling situations, however, such a global view is not possible, and it becomes necessary to study local systems influenced by external dynamics, possibly on different spatial or temporal scales.  To better understand these phenomena, the PI will study open systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms, as well as large-scale systems of smaller interacting components that exchange mass or energy.  These problems are strongly motivated by connections with statistical mechanics and seek to advance our understanding of fundamental questions related to energy transport and diffusion.  This award will also support the involvement of undergraduates in mathematics research.  The highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems will enable the investigator to recruit undergraduate students to participate in related research projects.  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting students from underrepresented groups in research mathematics.  Students will disseminate results of their research via poster sessions, conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, this award will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education.<br/><br/>The funded research includes three specific projects.  The first project investigates the statistical and thermodynamic properties of both classical and non-equilibrium particle systems with collision interactions, an important class of models from statistical mechanics. The second concerns open systems, which relate on the one hand to physical systems in which mass or energy is allowed to escape, and on the other to the study of metastable states.  The third project generalizes open systems to include linked and extended dynamical systems comprised of two or more components that exchange mass or energy through deterministic or random mechanisms.  Important examples include the aperiodic Lorentz gas and mechanical models of heat conduction.  The investigator will bring to bear several analytical techniques that he has been instrumental in developing for these classes of systems, including his recent work concerning the spectral decomposition of transfer operators for dispersing particle systems, contractions in projective cones due to Birkhoff, and the construction of Markov extensions adapted to open systems.  None of these techniques require Markovian assumptions on the dynamics, making them widely applicable to a wide variety of nonuniformly hyperbolic and physically important systems.  The application of these techniques to central models from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics will represent significant advances in the study of such systems.  Efforts to understand these tools in one context strengthens them and aids in their application to other areas of mathematics.

Somewhat surprisingly, there are many basic theoretical problems in this area of mathematics which remain unsolved despite the many incredible successes the field has already achieved. This project studies a family of questions in the area of geometric averages which, for example, correspond to quantifying the relationship between small changes in the imaged objects and the expected changes in measured data (which in practice would be processed computationally to recover an approximate picture of the original object). The theoretical challenge in a problem such as this is to precisely quantify the notion of change and to establish essentially exact relationships between the magnitude of input and output changes.

It could also be ""pseudorandom"" - described by a deterministic algorithm, but yet statistically indistinguishable from a genuinely random sequence.  Or it could be some complex mixture of structure and (pseudo)randomness.  Can one define precisely what structure and randomness mean and describe arbitrary data as combinations of these two different components?  Such questions are of importance in cryptography, computer science, combinatorics, dynamics, and number theory, as they allow one to mathematically determine whether certain patterns in arbitrary streams of data are guaranteed to occur or not.  For instance, in 2004, Ben Green and the PI were able to settle a long-standing conjecture in number theory that the prime numbers contained arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, with the key idea being to break up the prime numbers into structured and random components and study the contribution of each component.  In computer science, this theory has led, for instance, to efficient ways to generate pseudorandom bits for several types of applications. In the subsequent twenty years, much progress has been made in quantifying more precisely what structure and randomness mean, particularly in the area of mathematics now known as higher-order Fourier analysis.  More understanding has been gained on the precise way in which number-theoretic structures, such as the primes, exhibit (pseudo-)random behavior at both large and small scales. There has been steady progress in this direction in recent years, in which the scale on which one is able to definitively demonstrate various types of pseudorandomness has narrowed over time, and further work will be carried out in this project, in particular, it is tantalizingly near to resolve (a version) of a well-known conjecture in number theory - the Chowla conjecture - which could be in turn a stepping stone to even more famous conjectures such as the twin prime conjecture.

Such equations arise, for example, in the mathematical theory of heat conduction: an equation of elliptic type describes steady state (equilibrium) temperature distributions and a related parabolic equation governs heat conduction in the time-evolutive case. In a boundary value problem, one uses mathematical knowledge of either 1) the temperature distribution on the boundary (i.e., perimeter) of some region in space (or of some evolving region in space-time) or 2) the heat flux (the rate at which heat flows across the boundary), to deduce information about the internal temperature distribution inside the region. In free boundary problems, one uses simultaneous knowledge of both the boundary temperature distribution and the heat flux to deduce information about the geometry of the region and its boundary. A central goal of this project is to understand the interplay between analytic information and geometry. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project has three main areas of focus:  1) to find a geometric characterization of the space-time domains for which the Dirichlet (or initial-Dirichlet) problem is solvable for the heat equation with singular (p-integrable) data, and to study related free boundary problems. The PI and coauthors have previously treated such problems in the steady state (elliptic) setting; in the present project, the PI seeks to treat the more difficult time-evolutive case. 2) to solve the Kato square root problem for elliptic equations in non-divergence form. The solution of the Kato problem for divergence form elliptic operators has led to significant progress in the theory of boundary value problems for divergence form equations. As a first step towards opening up the analogous theory in the nondivergence setting, the PI plans to treat the Kato problem for non-divergence elliptic operators.   3) to solve the Dirichlet problem in Lipschitz domains for non-symmetric divergence from elliptic equations with periodic coefficients.

While these equations have been studied for many decades, much remains to be understood about the dynamics of solutions. This project will focus on deriving theoretical results in one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas of study: singularity formation. Roughly, singularities are infinities that can develop in solutions, making the equations exceptionally challenging to study. Such infinities lie at the crux of some of the most fascinating physical phenomena. Outstanding examples include Big Bangs in general relativity, where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite, and shock waves in compressible fluids, where pressure gradients become infinitely large. The results of the project will shed deep new insights into the laws of nature. The PI will integrate education, research, and scientific training by incorporating undergraduates, Master?s degree students, PhD students, and postdoctoral scholars into the research program.<br/><br/>The PI aims to prove novel stable blowup-results in multidimensions for solutions to the Cauchy problem for the PDE systems mentioned above, which are quasilinear and hyperbolic in character. For compressible Euler flow, the goal is to prove shock-formation, with an eye towards understanding the global structure of the largest possible classical solution, i.e, the Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development (MGHD). There are currently no results on the global structure of the MGHD, and such results are essential for proving the uniqueness of classical solutions with shocks. For the viscous fluid models, there are currently no constructive blowup-results, so any constructive singularity-formation result would be the first of its kind. For Einstein?s equations (coupled to various matter models), the goal is to understand the structure and stability of spacetime singularities, with a focus on techniques that are localizable and robust, thus allowing one to probe new solution regimes.

The classical setting of this problem pertains to particle systems which collide according to the laws of classical mechanics. The same problem emerges in more modern theories of statistical physics, where particles are replaced by waves that interact according to some Hamiltonian wave-type partial differential equation. Such theories of statistical physics for waves often go by the name of ?wave turbulence theory?, because they play a central role in understanding turbulent behaviors in wave systems. This has applications in many areas of science such as quantum mechanics, oceanography, climate science, etc. Broadly speaking, the goal of this project is to advance the mathematical, and hence scientific, understanding of such turbulence theories, and settle some longstanding conjectures in mathematical physics on the foundations of statistical mechanics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Even in its classical setting, Hilbert?s sixth problem remains a formidable task, that has only been resolved for short times. The project seeks to provide its long-time resolution, thus giving a final answer to this longstanding open problem. This amounts to giving the rigorous derivation of Boltzmann?s kinetic equation starting from Newton?s laws, followed by the derivation of the macroscopic fluid models (Euler?s and Navier-Stokes equations). In parallel, the project proposes similar justifications in the setting of wave turbulence theory. There too, the Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to provide the long-time derivation of the corresponding ?wave kinetic equations? for various wave systems of scientific interest. Starting with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation as a prime model for nonlinear wave systems, this will be followed by similar investigations for other wave systems, like many-particle quantum systems and some models coming from ocean and climate science. Finally, the project will investigate mathematical problems related to the turbulence aspects of wave turbulence theory.

Partial differential equations (PDE) modeling wave propagation phenomena have played a fundamental role in understanding such physical and natural events as well as quantum mechanics, fiber optics, ferromagnetism, atmospheric and water waves, and many other physical models. In these cases, wave phenomena are never too smooth or too simple, and in fact the byproduct of nonlinear wave interactions as they propagate in time. Being able to understand and describe the dynamical behavior of such models under certain noisy conditions or given an initial statistical ensemble and have a precise description of how the inherent randomness built in these models propagates, is fundamental to accurately predict wave phenomena when studying the natural world. This project is aimed at answering several central questions about long-time dynamics and the propagation of randomness in this context using analytical and probabilistic methodologies. The work of the project, and its connections to science, promotes interdisciplinary interactions and fosters the training of graduate students and junior researchers in the United States thus fundamentally contributing to its STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The interplay of deterministic methods in nonlinear PDE and probabilistic ones naturally feed off each other and when combined contribute to a deep understanding of wave phenomena, which opens the door to new paradigms that move research forward in various directions.

Many such processes exhibit an interface, where the equation becomes degenerate or singular. In the case of a model of gas diffusion through a porous medium, the interface is the set which separates the region where there is gas from the region where there is no gas. The boundary of a liquid droplet is another example of an interface. The project will investigate qualitative and quantitative properties of these interfaces, including convexity and smoothness. For a composite material, consisting of two materials with different conductivity properties, the interface is where these materials meet. The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the behavior of the electric field when one of the materials has a very thin part. This project has possible implications for material failure, an important question in Engineering. Students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained on the techniques and theory of these PDE models.<br/><br/>This project centers on four topics, connected by the themes of interfaces, degeneracies, and convexity/concavity. The porous medium equation is a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation used to model the diffusion of gas. The PI will investigate questions of concavity and convexity of solutions and finding global optimal regularity estimates. Secondly, the PI will study linear PDE whose coefficients are discontinuous along two almost touching interfaces, a model for transmission problems and composite materials. In this setting, the PI will investigate new approaches to obtaining optimal gradient estimates in the thin region between the interfaces. A third project is to study linear equations which are parabolic on the interior on a fixed domain but are degenerate at the boundary. These equations arise as linearizations of the porous medium equation and the Gauss curvature flow. The PI will investigate optimal conditions for existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions.

A typical examples include turbulent fluids, such as the earth's atmosphere, which have fluctuations on the human scale (a gust of wind) and on the continental scale (weather patterns), and every scale in between. Other examples include important models in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. Such chaotic physical systems have interesting behaviors which emerge through the interaction of these very different length scales, often called ""critical phenomena"" by physicists. Physicists have developed heuristic, non-rigorous ways of understanding and analyzing many such physical systems, some of which are called ""renormalization group"" arguments. One of the main goals of this project is to develop precise versions of these informal arguments which are mathematically rigorous. In the past decade, the work of the Principal Investigator (PI) and other mathematicians have led to a rigorous theory of ""quantitative homogenization"" of certain partial differential equations. These equations have some of the properties of the complex physical systems mentioned above, and the homogenization theory resembles renormalization group-type arguments in important ways. However, it currently works well only for problems with a small number of length scales. The project proposes to increase the level of sophistication of the homogenization methods until the theory can be deployed more flexibly on physical systems exhibiting critical behavior. This requires the development of new mathematical ideas and concepts and will require input from analysis, probability theory, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/> <br/>The project has two main goals. The first one concerns improving the quantitative homogenization theory, so that it is more explicit in its dependence on important parameters in the equation (like the ellipticity ratio) and allows for degenerate and possibly unbounded coefficient fields. This is a well-known open problem in the subfield, but the PI and his collaborator Kuusi have made recent progress on this question, and this project will continue to develop these new ideas. A second focus of the project is to use these analytic methods developed for homogenization as means of formalizing heuristic renormalization group arguments in physics. Such methods arise in a wide variety of contexts, but the project has a few specific problems in mind. One arises in fluid turbulence, and concerns proving the anomalous diffusion of a passive scalar advected by a rough vector field. The PI and his collaborator Vicol have made recent progress on this question by using homogenization to formalize a renormalization group argument. This points the way to further possibilities, including the construction of more physically realistic examples of anomalous diffusion.

Kinetic equations involve a nonlinear diffusive operator with respect to velocity, combined with a transport equation with respect to space. The regularization effect in all variables requires ideas from hypoelliptic theory. For the Boltzmann equation in the case of very soft potentials, as well as for the Landau equation with Coulomb potentials, the diffusive part of the equations is not strong enough to prevent the solution from blowing up in theory. In that case, new ideas are needed to properly understand the regularization effects of the equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This field is concerns functions with Fourier transform (frequencies) supported (non-zero at most) on some curved objects such as a sphere or a cone. Such functions appear naturally in several areas of science and mathematics: in the study of Schrödinger equations, wave equations and number theory. For instance, a solution to the linear wave equation can be represented as a function with Fourier transform supported on a cone. Investigating these functions allows one to understand how waves evolve in time. In number theory, one can count the number of integer solutions to some Diophantine equations (polynomial equations with integer coefficients) by estimating such functions. Namely, if the corresponding functions are concentrated, then one expects the Diophantine equation to have many integer solutions. And an upper bound on the number of solutions can be given in terms of how spread out the functions are. This project will be focused on how the curvature of the Fourier support prevents the functions from being concentrated.<br/><br/>The work will be concentrated on oscillatory integrals and related to Falconer's conjecture. The latter is an unsolved question concerning the sets of Euclidean distances between points in compact d-dimensional spaces. The projects on oscillatory integrals concern the restriction conjecture, the Hormander operator, and decoupling questions. For the restriction conjecture, Stein's restriction conjecture will be studied in higher dimensions and in dimension three. For the Hörmander operator the Bochner-Riesz conjecture will be investigated by considering it as a Hörmander operator not satisfying Bourgain's ""generic failure"" condition. Work will be done on the dimension of radial projections with applications surrounding Falconer's conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, one isoperimetric-type inequality gives the mathematical justification that a metal rod will have the strongest resistance to twisting forces if its cross-sections are circular. This project investigates several geometric questions related to isoperimetric and Sobolev-type inequalities, including the following: if one only has measurements of a given rod's resistance to twisting forces, how much geometric information can be recovered about the shape of the rod's cross-sections? Questions of this type have powerful and sometimes unexpected applications in other branches of mathematics. A fundamental part of the project is a two-pillared educational component. First, the Principal Investigator (PI) will organize a workshop for women in analysis at Carnegie Mellon University, integrating research and education through mini-courses, research talks, and opportunities for junior researchers. Second, the PI will initiate a joint Directed Reading Program between Carnegie Mellon University and the neighboring University of Pittsburgh, delivering vertically integrated mathematical and professional development and a timely opportunity to rebuild bridges between the two departments post-pandemic. <br/> <br/>This project, rooted in the calculus of variations and partial differential equations, develops novel applications of isoperimetric and Sobolev-type inequalities to attack central questions in analysis and geometry, and explores the interplay between geometry and optimal constants and equality cases for the inequalities. The PI will develop a framework for proving a new type of broadly applicable quantitative stability estimate in the context of isoperimetric problems for shape functionals driven by partial differential equations; prove quantitative descriptions of local minimizers of isoperimetric problems in Riemannian manifolds and Euclidean domains, expanding the toolbox in this area; via doubly-constrained Sobolev-type minimization problems, build constant scalar curvature conformal metrics with constant mean curvature boundary of prescribed area; and prove localized versions of epsilon-regularity theorems for Riemannian manifolds with lower bounds on scalar curvature, paving the way for the analysis of singularities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
