The P.I. will continue his study of finite dimensional approximations to path integral formulas on path and loop spaces over compact Riemannian manifolds.  It is hoped that these approximations will lead to: 1) a rigorous interpretation of the heuristic path integral proofs of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem, 2) construction of Brownian motions on path and loop spaces, 3) construction of non-trivial harmonic differential forms on loop groups, and 4) construction of Dirac operators on loop spaces.  These goals are consistent with the principal investigators ongoing project to understand index theorems and the Hodge -- de Rham theorem for loop spaces.  It is also proposed to try to generalize a result (related to the Segal Bargmann transform) of L. Gross and the P.I. from complex finite dimensional groups to complex loop groups.<br/><br/> Spaces of loops naturally arise in the mathematical study of surfaces and of higher dimensional manifolds.  For example, if there is a loop on a surface that can not be deformed to a point without tearing the loop apart, then the surface must contain a ""hole."" (Think of the surface of a doughnut versus the surface of a sphere.)  The physicists' string theory description of the fundamental particles of nature also use loops or ""strings.""  The quantum mechanical treatment of string theory leads to problems similar to those proposed for study by the P.I.  This proposal is devoted to answering basic mathematical questions about the (Feynman) path integral formulation of quantum mechanics on both finite dimensional curved surfaces and on the loops on such surfaces.  As a by-product of this research, the P.I. hopes to make rigorous the very beautiful physics argument for the so-called Atiyah-Singer Index theorem.  This index theorem is arguably one of the most striking mathematical developments of this century and it has had far reaching implications in both mathematics and in physics.<br/>"

The first problem is to characterize scaling limits of rather general systems of random curves.  One aspect of the problem is to determine the regularity and dimension of a given (not necessarily random) curve without actually parametrizing it. Moreover, a sequence of scaling exponents which are relevant for regularity and tightness will be studied. The second problem is concerned specifically with random spanning trees in two dimensions. Precise conjectures exist regarding the values of the exponents in a number of examples. The object is to confirm or contradict those predictions, especially for the first three non-trivial exponents. A related question is whether the scaling limits of two standard examples, called the Minimal (Random) Spanning Tree, and the Uniformly Random Spanning Tree, differ or coincide in the limit. Moreover, existing methods should be extended to cover a class of tree processes on random graphs which has natural conformal invariance properties. Work on these questions will be part of a continuing collaboration.  The third problem is to try to establish any non-trivial bound on the dimension of self-avoiding random walks, adapting techniques that were successful for random spanning trees  and loop-erased walks. Finally, the investigator will participate in a collaborative effort aimed at understanding the connecting curves in high-dimensional critical percolation. <br/><br/>Random curves provide some of the most natural examples of fractal sets. They appear in random spanning trees (where every pair of points is connected by a unique curve), in critical percolation clusters (where two points are in the same cluster, if they are joined by a path along occupied bonds), as random walks, and as interfaces between random subsets of the plane (such as the Frontier of Brownian Motion, or level sets of random functions). These systems of random curves are typically constructed on a fine lattice within some box of finite size. Simulations suggest that in many models of interest, a meaningful continuum limit emerges as the lattice spacing is taken to zero. It is widely believed that these limits have remarkable symmetry properties, and that they should admit simple descriptions. However, there are only partial results guaranteeing that such limits even exist, and many questions about their properties remain open. <br/>"

These problems are associated with stochastic <br/>adaptive control which is the control of an incompletely known <br/>stochastic system.  Typically to solve an adaptive control problem <br/>it is necessary to identify the unknown parameter of the system and <br/>simultaneously to construct a control.  The cost functionals for the <br/>control problems are typically ergodic (average cost per unit time).  <br/>A family of processes, fractional Brownian motion, is proposed for <br/>development by extending a stochastic calculus and using these <br/>processes for adaptive control problems.  This family of processes <br/>seems to have wide applicability.  Adaptive control for stochastic <br/>distributed parameter systems is proposed by considering partially <br/>known semilinear systems.  This family of systems includes some <br/>stochastic partial differential equations.  The adaptive control of <br/>continuous time branching processes is proposed for investigation <br/>because these processes are important and little use of control has <br/>been made for these processes.  Risk sensitive control problems are <br/>especially useful for financial models.  It is proposed to study <br/>adaptive control for these problems.  The work in this proposal <br/>should be applicable to physical systems that have stochastic <br/>models that are controlled.  It should enhance the understanding of <br/>these physical systems.<br/><br/>Mathematical models are used to describe physical systems and <br/>analysis is performed on these mathematical models.  Typically it <br/>is required to control the physical systems so that control is <br/>introduced in the mathematical models.  Usually the models are not <br/>completely specified so it is necessary to identify some parameters <br/>of the model from the evolution of the system.  To describe <br/>perturbations or unmodelled dynamics in a system, noise is <br/>introduced in the model.  The control of an incompletely specified <br/>system with noise is called stochastic adaptive control.  It is <br/>proposed to investigate a wide variety of problems in stochastic <br/>adaptive control.  These problems include lumped and distributed <br/>systems.

The techniques that are applicable to the two areas are often related.  Professor Bramson intends to study stability questions and the behavior under diffusive scaling for the first class of models; the use of fluid models is an important tool in such analysis.  The second class includes models such as the voter model, and two-type particle systems with the annihilation and creation of mass. The equilibria and the limiting concentrations are the objects of investigation for such models.<br/><br/>Queueing networks and interacting particle systems are two subjects within the field of probability theory.  The goal in both areas is to understand the long-term behavior of large systems of objects, such as customers or particles, for which there is randomness in the system.  Here, ""customers"" need not denote just individuals, but also products or some task to be performed, such as in the manufacture of semiconductor wafers.  In queueing theory, one analyzes the efficiency and stability of such systems.  The proposal concentrates on the latter topic, and on the statistical fluctuations that are inherent in such systems.  In interacting particle systems, one studies complex random systems that occur in the context of physics, chemistry and biology, whose components represent, for example, particles, cells, or various organisms.  For instance, one studies models for the outcome of a chemical reaction, or the genetic diversity of a population.  The proposal investigates the nature of the long-term equilibria of such systems.<br/>"

The proposed project encompasses the following topics: statistical approach to ill-posed problems for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), analysis of optimal input signals for parameter estimation, and averaging and singularly perturbed systems with transient and null-recurrent diffusions.  To treat the ill-posed problems, the techniques will be based on statistical approaches. Assuming that the observation is the solution of an ODE or a PDE plus a white Gaussian noise with small intensity, the attention will be devoted to the estimation of the unknown source of nonlinear PDEs and certain coefficients appearing in linear differential equations.  The nonparametric estimation approach to reconstruction of initial/boundary conditions for PDE with partial observations in white noise will be studied. Focusing on analysis of optimal signals for parameter estimation, the main effort is to find asymptotically efficient adaptive estimation procedures. Asymptotically stable, neutral, and unstable systems will be examined.  A two-step estimation procedure will be adopted.  The first step builds a preliminary estimator based on input signals, and the second step fine tunes the estimate using a Newton-Raphson type correction.  Analyzing asymptotic properties of diffusion processes where the fast changing process does not possess a finite invariant measure, both null-recurrent cases and transient processes will be treated.  In addition to obtaining certain results on limit distribution of integral functionals of null-recurrent diffusions, the asymptotic properties of the singularly perturbed systems will be examined in detail.  The proposed topics are motivated by various applications in control, optimization, image processing and other related fields. The expected results will have a wide range of applications.<br/><br/> The fast-paced progress in technology and the complexity of modern systems necessitates communication, exchange of ideas and cooperative research at the international level.  The proposed project presents an effort of cooperative research between researchers from Wayne State University and outstanding scientists from Russia.  By combining force and expertise, asymptotic analysis for singularly perturbed stochastic systems will be examined and statistical estimation problems will be studied.  The results of the research will be useful for many applications in manufacturing systems, data analysis, image processing, control and optimization of stochastic systems.  The continued and increased collaborations will bring both short and long term fruitful returns.  The proposed project will be successful and effective in accelerating progress in these fields.  The cooperative research project will also foster the establishment of long term significant collaborations among the researchers in the U.S. and Russia, which will also be beneficial to the international scientific community.<br/>"

These include numerical approximations of expectations of both functions and functionals of solutions of SDEs, whether they be diffusions or more generally Markov processes with jumps.  Models inspired by Stochastic Finance theory will receive  attention; one example is forward-backward SDEs, where a general weak existence and uniqueness theorem is sought.  Further a special emphasis is devoted to filtering theory where a new Monte Carlo approach is developed, and also a martingale problem approach will be tried to treat the infinite dimensional case.  Stochastic partial differential equations will be studied via a new method of viscosity solutions, hopefully yielding existence, uniqueness and stability results in the fully nonlinear case.  Quasi-linear backward SDEs will be studied with an eye to applications in Stochastic Finance theory; in addition several problems in Finance theory will be treated directly, including complete markets with jumps and competitive price equilibria in incomplete markets.<br/> The principal investigators of this project study stochastic differential  equations.  A differential equation models phenomena that vary with time,  dealing with rates of change.  A stochastic differential equation includes the  possibility that the change comes from random forces.  Examples of  applications can be found in modeling radio and x-ray transmissions, and  cellular telephone signals, where the randomness comes from static noise;  biological examples where growth of viruses and plants have a random  component; and also in banking and finance where interest rate models,  commodity prices, and securities prices are modeled with random components.   The stochastic differential equations are complicated and sophisticated and  cannot be solved with explicit solutions: the desired quantities need to be  approximated by using a high speed computer.  Efficient algorithms are needed  and these methods are not yet well understood; by consequence the practitioner  has a choice to use models that are too simple but with methods that work, or  models that better approximate the true state of nature but for which methods  work poorly, if at all.  We propose to remedy this situation to a large extent  by developing algorithms that work for the better models, and in addition we  propose to quantify to what extent the models are effective."

The work on diffusions is aimed at various aspects of coupling and their applications. One goal is to develop a method for coupling a diffusion which arises from a Dirichlet form. A potential application of this work is a probabilistic proof of the Moser Harnack inequality. Another goal is to study the efficiency of the commonly used mirror coupling on manifolds. A goal of this work is to gain potential new insights of the influence of geometry on the bottom of the spectrum. A third problem is to determine which diffusions with the normalized Riemannian volume as equilibrium distribution converge to equilibrium the fastest. The principal problems in flows focus on rates of dispersion of bodies under stochastic flows. <br/> This research concentrates on the diffusion of particles on geometric structures called manifolds. It arises from the theory of Brownian motion and exploits well known connections between diffusions and the spread of heat in bodies (manifolds). Part of the research deals with rates of change of temperature distributions on manifolds while another deals with the rate of convergence to a steady state temperature distribution. These can be studied by diffusion theory and the influence of the geometry of the manifold on these quantities can be determined.

The first project involves a model for mutually catalytic branching. The goal is to understand the simultaneous evolution of two spatially distributed populations undergoing random motion and reproduction, where individuals from one population reproduce and die only in the presence of individuals from the other population. The second project involves measure-valued scaling limits of interacting particle systems. The goal is to study further the phenomenon, only recently discovered, that certain lattice systems with strong local interactions converge, when scaled appropriately, to super-Brownian motion. In particular, a detailed description of this phenomenon for the voter model in two or more dimensions is a primary goal; both spatial and genealogical structure will be studied. The third project involves questions which arise in the study of mathematical models of hybrid zones. The goal here is to describe the large scale behavior of models with a spatially dependent selection mechanism, especially when the selective advantage parameter is small.<br/> This research involves several topics in the theory and application of stochastic spatial processes. The goal of this research is to obtain a better qualitative understanding of some of the complex phenomena exhibited by systems made up of a large number of interacting components, with the interaction having a stochastic or random element. Such systems occur in many applications, one notable area being theoretical biology and ecology, where there is great interest in improving older mathematical models which do not allow for explicit spatial dependence (as do these models). Stochastic spatial models are used to study questions involving predator-prey interactions, species coexistence, and genetic diversity. These models often have dozens of parameters and interaction rules; consequently, they are generally not amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. The investigator plans research on several specific models which retain the interesting qualitative behavior of more complicated models, but are ""simple"" enough to allow for the possibility of mathematical analysis. By studying these models, the investigator seeks to give rigorous mathematical arguments which explain the observed behavior of the models. The investigator also plans to study what appears to be an intimate connection between two apparently different types of stochastic spatial models (discrete models with strong interactions and continuous models with weak interactions).<br/>"

Decoupling theory has been very successful in translating problems involving dependent variables into ones involving independent variables through the use of inequalities specially designed for that purpose. In this research the PI will study three major problems, and consider approaches (including decoupling methods) that may be used in solving them. The first problem involves a general and natural approach to approximate the expected waiting time for a random process to hit a boundary in terms of the function determined by the expected value of the supremum of the process. This approach permits the use of the historical averages in developing useful approximations. The second problem concerns an approximation to the speed of convergence of sums of dependent variables in terms of known results for sums of independent variables. This problem has the potential of widely expanding the applicability of the principle of conditioning, a method that extends the martingale central limit theorem. The third problem develops probability approximations for self-normalized martingales. Results from this problem have the potential to impact several areas of probability and statistics, including the theory of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, since typically self-normalized variables serve as pivotal quantities in the construction of confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis.<br/> A common assumption made in the development of statistical and probabilistic methods concerns the predicate that the variables or processes are independent or have independence properties, that is, what happens to one of the variables does not affect what happens to the other. This independence assumption has the effect of simplifying the mathematical complexity of the problem and is quite common in practice. Due to this simplification it seems natural to seek approaches that would permit the use of results involving independent variables in the case the variables are dependent. The PI has been heavily involved in such a project through the development of ``Decoupling'' theory which has the above paradigm as its goal. His first problem in the current research is to develop a probabilistic theory for the use of historical data to obtain estimates of the time dependent processes take to reach a boundary. His preliminary work provides useful connections between the study of this problem and the study of the case of boundary crossing by non-random functions through the use of the average (or expected) behavior of the processes involved. This work has the potential to impact profoundly several areas of scientific knowledge where boundary crossing times are important and historical knowledge of the behavior of the process in question is available. Examples of specific areas of application include approximations to waiting time for: 1) an earthquake to happen, 2) for the next tornado to arrive, 3) for a dam to overflow, 4) for a computer to crash. All this when historical records are available. The second problem involves the development of results connecting the efficiency of approximations used involving independent variables to obtain similar approximations for dependent variables, a potentially cost saving device for choosing between competing statistical procedures. The third problem involves the study of self-normalized statistics based on dependent variables or processes. This type of statistic provides key quantities used in the development of confidence intervals for parameters. An example of how dependence enters into this type of problem concerns the development of interval estimates for the percentage of voters which will vote for a given candidate in the case the voters do not act independently but influence each other's <br/>decisions."

In new directions he is studying sharp inequalities for expected extrema and general continuity-representation theorems. The research has both theoretical and applied components, and involves collaboration with other researchers both at Georgia Tech and other universities, as well as with several graduate students.<br/> This research involves the study of random processes, such as evolving financial markets or government policies, when unpredictable fluctuations are present.

One of the thrusts of this research is to try to discover good methods for deciding when to stop or change a policy when only partial information is available about the random fluctuations. Another thrust of this research is to develop new statistical tools for estimating changes in random processes. One very new use of these ideas is application to detection of fraud in financial data. The idea is that fabricated data is usually qualitatively different from true data, and there are just recently tests based on these fluctuation theories which are proving useful in distinguishing true from fabricated data.

Filtering equations for nonstandard observation structures will be derived and analyzed. Previous work on the martingale characterization of regular control problems will be extended to singular and partially observed control problems. Methods for the study of large deviations for Markov processes based on convergence of nonlinear semigroups will be extended to new classes of models.

The work will focus on spatial ergodicity and central limit theorems with applications to parameter estimation in mind.<br/> The study of stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions of natural phenomena governed by ""random"" or ""chance"" mechanisms. Mathematical models of such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or both.

The theory of growth models has played a key role in the analysis of spatial complex systems, dating back to the middle of the century.  During the present funding period, Griffeath will seek to further that theory by focusing on five main research projects: scaling laws for critical monotone solidification, shape theory for random perturbations of threshold growth, a prototype of spinodal clustering, quantitative analysis of 'small-world networks', and asymptotics for von Koch - type CA solidification.  These studies are primarily theoretical, their goal being rigorous mathematical results.  On the experimental side, Griffeath has begun to examine more complex interactions which exhibit a wide variety of intriguing self-organizational effects not present in the simplest ""linear"" spatial systems.  Preliminary empirical modeling projects at present include digital biofilms, nonlinear spatial modeling of social interaction, CA pattern dynamics, and a simple CA paradigm for traffic jams.<br/><br/> In broad strokes, the ongoing research of David Griffeath combines mathematical analysis and computer visualization in the study of complex spatial systems.  The investigator exploits this interplay for the theoretical and empirical study of deterministic and random cellular automata, local lattice dynamics which serve as prototypes for spiral formation in excitable media, the morphology of crystals, and various other nonlinear processes such as nucleation, flocking, host-parasite interactions, dendritic growth, and phase separation by surface tension.  The analysis of aggregation, shape, interfaces, and droplet interaction for such basic growth models sheds new light on many areas of applied science.

In the study of tilings one examines the different ways in which a region can be built by fitting together smaller pieces (called tiles) taken from a small collection of shapes.  The combinatorial perspective focuses on the question `In how many ways can this tiling problem be solved?' while the probabilistic perspective focuses on the question `What does a typical solution to this tiling problem look like?'  In many instances these tiling models are equivalent to models studied by statistical mechanicians for decades, but the new outlook is leading to many results that the physicists missed.  The tools that are used in attacking these questions range from complex analysis and the calculus of variations to ergodic theory and interacting particle systems.<br/><br/>On one level, this is basic mathematical research whose main motivation (like that of most theoretical mathematics) arises from the desire to understand phenomena that are simple yet surprising, especially in cases where existing analytical tools do not make it possible to provide rigorous proofs of empirically well-founded conjectures.  A further (and potentially more applicable) motivation for this research comes from the fact that tilings are simplified models of matter, particularly of matter that incorporates randomness at the very finest levels of organization.  In many cases, the precise details of the tiling problem (the shape of the tiles and of the region to be tiled) enforce a kind of large-scale heterogeneity reminiscent of physical systems in which different phases of a substance (such as ice, liquid water, and steam) coexist.  In studying tiling models, one can prove rigorous results concerning the ways in which the boundaries between different phases are maintained thermodynamically.  Thus the study of tilings can serve as a kind of a test-bed in which some ideas about random media can be subjected to mathematical analysis.<br/>"

It is concerned with the development of such models, the study of their properties and the investigation of systematic techniques for fitting them to data.  Also considered are the large-sample properties of the estimated model parameters and the performance of model-based forecasts.  Many of the standard tools of linear time series analysis (e.g. the sample autocovariance function) have substantially different properties when the underlying process is nonlinear and this must be taken into account when they are used in conjunction with nonlinear models.  Nonlinear continuous time ARMA models have been found useful in the modeling of financial data.  Efficient estimation for these processes and for non-Gaussian and multivariate extensions of these are to be investigated to allow for the observed heavy-tailed behavior of financial time series and to permit the study of the dependence between related financial time series.  An alternative promising approach to the analysis of financial time series is to use all-pass linear filters driven by non-Gaussian noise as a possible alternative to the use of nonlinear models.  Integer-valued time series are of wide occurrence, for example the weekly numbers of accidents or diagnosed cases of some disease.  As for the models considered above, the objective is to develop a systematic approach to the modelling and forecasting of such data.<br/><br/>In the last ten years there has been a steadily increasing realization that non-linear time series models provide much better representations of many empirically observed time series than the classical linear models.  Many of the properties of non-linear models are however not yet understood and there is a need for the development of new models accompanied by efficient model-fitting procedures.  At the same time there has been a surge of interest in continuous-time time series models, partly as a result of the very successful application of stochastic differential equation models to problems in finance, exemplified by the derivation of the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and its generalizations.  This proposal is concerned with the development of non-linear models in both discrete and continuous time with particular emphasis on the application of these models to the representation and forecasting of financial data.  Another class of time series which arises frequently in applications and for which systematic analysis is relatively undeveloped are those in which the observations are integer-valued.  For these series also a systematic approach to model-building and forecasting is proposed.<br/>"

This ``weak convergence"" methodology is applied in several areas.  Stochastic coalescence deals with the merging of particles into larger and larger clusters according to some rate kernel.  The particular case of the additive rate kernel, which has a rich structure relating to continuum random trees, is being investigated in detail.  A novel process combining coalescence with immigration and removal and which appears to have an interesting phase transition is also being studied.  In a different direction, there is increasing interest in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees (indicating relationships between biological species).  Some toy models for sampling from target distributions on tree-space are studied via the weak convergence methodology.<br/><br/>The general area of research concerns large systems with random aspects to their behavior.  As such systems become larger, their behavior gets more difficult to analyze, either via mathematical theory or via computer simulation.  But in some cases it is possible to overcome this difficulty by relating the behavior of sufficiently large finite systems to that of some fixed infinite-size system.  This methodology is being applied in two areas. One area is refining analysis of models of random clustering of mass, a topic of interest in many areas of science (e.g. polymers in physical chemistry, condensation of raindrops in clouds, and formation of galaxies in the early universe).  The other area is the analysis of performance of algorithms for reconstructing relationships between biological species, specifically in how performance scales with number of species.<br/>"

The traditional approach, based on compatibility conditions, provides only partial results about solvability and regularity of the solutions of such equations and often excludes equations appearing in applications.  The investigator's goal is to establish solvability and regularity results for a wide class of linear and quasi-linear parabolic equations without using compatibility conditions.  To control the solution near the boundary of the region, special Sobolev-type spaces with weights are introduced.  These spaces can also be of independent interest in the classical theory of deterministic elliptic and parabolic equations.<br/><br/> Many natural phenomena are modeled by equations with randomness.  The random, or stochastic, component in the equation accounts for the uncertainties in the model.  Successful analysis of the real life models is impossible without a rigorous mathematical theory of these stochastic equations.  The aim of the proposed research is a comprehensive study of a major class of such equations using various probabilistic and analytical tools.  Some of these tools have been developed by the investigator and his colleagues and successfully used to study the equation of optimal nonlinear filtering, the main equation used in target tracking and target recognition.

These representations contain all of the information of the original spin-system and, in the best of cases, provide a definitive signal (percolation) for phase transitions or phase coexistence.  The most familiar example of such a representation is the random cluster representation for the q-state Potts model.  Recently, a number of new graphical representations associated with other models have emerged.  In addition to their intrinsic interest, the study of these problems is important for two reasons: (i) The representations provide a powerful analytical tool with which to study the underlying statistical mechanics problem.  (ii) The representations are the basis of the cluster methods, a modern class of Monte Carlo algorithms that allow for the rapid simulation of these (underlying) problems. To realize item (ii) and, for the most part item (i) as well, it is essential to achieve ""the best of cases"" i.e. demonstrate that the phase transition in the statistical mechanics problem is mirrored by a percolation transition in the graphical representation.  In general, the PI will continue research on the development of new graphical representations and cluster algorithms with an eye towards the construction of algorithms in equilibrium statistical mechanics and other problems that are computationally complex.<br/><br/>This research may be described as follows:  The primitive mathematical descriptions of interacting systems necessarily involves a great deal of superfluous information.  At best this information is simply of no importance and at worst, it can obscure the subtle effects that are the object of study. Graphical representations present an alternative description.  Although the mathematical content of the description is identical to the original, the form is quite different:  Much of the superfluous information is pushed into the background and the interesting features are often exhibited rather dramatically as geometric phenomena.  Of further importance is that these geometric representations are the key ingredient in a class of computer algorithms (cluster algorithms) that are used in statistical physics.  Until recently, only a handful of systems have admitted such descriptions but the situation has improved a great deal in the last few years.  Progress will continue in expanding the scope of the applicability of these methods both in equilibrium statistical mechanics an in other area where computational complexity forbids the straightforward approach.<br/>"

An important direction of the research will be to prove general results in support of the picture advocated by Durrett and Levin (1994): the behavior of stochastic spatial models can be predicted from that of the mean field ODE obtained by pretending all sites are always independent.  He will also continue work on hybrid zones, progressing now to the derivation of PDE limits for these systems as selection tends to 0, and the study of spatially inhomogeneous models to understand the structure of mosaic hybrid zones that have been seen in field work on the cricket species Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus.

Specifically, the principal investigators propose to study: diffeomorphism groups of manifolds; spaces of knots and links; the automorphism group and outer automorphism group of a free group; Whitehead algorithms for groups; the space of phylogenetic trees; Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, and buildings; the topology at infinity of Artin groups; and graphs of generating sets of finite groups.  <br/><br/>A unifying theme of this research is that of trying to understand abstract, algebraic constructions by relating them to concrete, geometric objects, somewhat as a sequence of abstract operations may be realized as a set of elementary manipulations of a Rubik's cube. The geometric objects in question are often very simple and natural, and can sometimes serve as mathematical models for phenomena in other scientific fields. For example, geometry and algebra have led to new results about Markov chains, which are used for simulations in many areas of science and applied mathematics. In addition, geometric insights often lead to the discovery of new relations between a priori unrelated concepts.  <br/>"

The principal ones deal with systems of weakly interacting random walks and with rho-percolation.  In the random walk systems one starts with one particle at each site of the integer lattice in d dimensions and lets each particle perform a continuous time random walk on this lattice.  Interactions occur only when a particle jumps to a site which is itself occupied or is adjacent to an occupied site.  In this case the particle which just jumped may coalesce with one of the particles at or adjacent to the site to which it jumped.  In another version the particle which just jumped may annihilate another particle.  The asymptotic density of such systems will be investigated.  Rho-percolation has the same set-up as ordinary site percolation.  The sites of a lattice are independently chosen to be occupied or vacant with probability p or 1-p, respectively.  One says that rho-percolation occurs if there exists an infinite self-avoiding path on the lattice whose lower density of occupied sites is at least rho.  The proposer intends to investigate analogues of various power bounds which are already known or conjectured for ordinary percolation.<br/><br/>This research will study problems about systems of particles which undergo random motion and which have an interaction which removes particles from the system when two particles come close to each other.  One motivation for studying such systems is that they can be viewed as crude models for certain chemical reactions.  It is hoped that the variants of the model proposed for investigation here are somewhat more realistic than the models usually considered.  Another, unrelated, class of problems in the proposal considers a system which undergoes a phase transition.  Almost all materials have phase transitions at some temperature or magnetic field.  Even though a great deal is known in statistical physics on the non rigorous level about phase transitions, they are still only poorly understood on a mathematical level.  It is hoped that interesting and instructive calculations can be carried out for the relatively new model of rho-percolation.<br/>"
