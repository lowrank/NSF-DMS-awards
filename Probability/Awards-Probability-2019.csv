Special emphasis is placed on certain SPDEs and related random fields that play a central role in various areas of pure and applied mathematics, mathematical oceanography, stochastic hydrology, geostatistics, and mathematical physics. The investigators will develop probabilistic, geometric, and analytic tools that will lead to a deeper understanding of a large family of physically- and mathematically-interesting SPDEs and related random fields. The investigators believe that these tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of long-standing open problems in the theory of SPDEs and related random fields, and also further promote their applicability. In addition, the activities include a sustained program to train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, and to develop their careers in the mathematical and statistical sciences.<br/><br/>It is both significant and challenging to characterize the fine local and asymptotic structure of SPDEs and related random fields.  In their past investigations, the investigators have established a series of results on the asymptotic behavior, intermittency, and macroscopic-scale multifractal properties of the solutions of SPDEs and related random fields, developed potential theories for additive Levy processes and the Brownian sheet, and used them to resolve several outstanding open problems in Levy processes, the Brownian sheet, and the theory of parabolic stochastic partial differential equations. The investigators have developed ideas, based on probability theory and geometric measure theory, for the analysis of non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields. They have also introduced renewal-theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of nonlinear SPDEs. They plan to continue their investigation of precise quantitative connections between SPDEs, random fields, potential theory, and the geometry of random fractals. They believe that further pursuit of these connections will ultimately yield novel insights into the structure of SPDEs,large-scale physical multifractals, and related random fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the problems are pertinent to various applied fields, including mathematical finance, control of dynamic systems, machine learning, and others. The PI will integrate her research expertise into teaching probability courses, mentoring students, and organizing conferences. The PI will also continue her effort in encouraging women and other underrepresented groups in math.<br/> <br/>The project focuses on random diffusion processes that are subject to a priori non-holonomic constraints which can perfectly fit into the framework of sub-Riemannian geometry. A recurring theme of proposed topics is the interaction between the underlying geometric structure and the limiting behaviors of the associated Markov processes. The project is primarily concerned with three topics. The first is to study stochastic processes and the explicit heat kernel on sub-Riemannian model spaces, which provides great examples and strong intuition for the understanding of general cases. The second topic concerns the limiting behaviors -in both small and large time scale -of a general degenerate diffusion process, which reflect the underlying geometric information of geodesic and Ricci curvature bound respectively. The third topic is to study the heat content of bounded domains in a sub-Riemannian manifold, which reveals the geometry of the domain such as surface area and total mean curvature of the boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its primary goals are to analyze phase transitions: for example liquid-to-solid transitions where the physical properties of a substance change abruptly.  The dimer model was originally conceived as a simplified model of two-dimensional matter in which phase transitions can be studied. Recent work, however, has linked the model to many other areas of mathematics, from combinatorics to string theory, where ''brane dimers'' are proposed as fundamental descriptions of spacetime at small scales.  The PIs propose to jointly investigate a number of interrelated topics in mathematics and physics, each of which has the dimer model as its underlying combinatorial structure. This project will lead to the organization of workshops and regular meetings of the PIs and their graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, continuing the PIs' efforts to get young mathematicians and physicists involved in these topics.  The PIs will contribute to the mathematical community through their mentorship of young scholars, research talks in conferences and workshops, papers published in peer-reviewed journals, and books on a selection of these topics.<br/><br/>The dimer model studies the set of all dimers, or perfect matchings, on a planar bipartite graph G on a disk or Riemann surface. Despite the simple definition, there are many open problems about the dimer model, as well as applications to geometry, algebra, and physics. There is a fundamental connection between the dimer model on the disk and the Grassmannian, via the fact that generating functions of dimers satisfy Plucker relations. This fact leads to the cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian, and the beautiful combinatorics of the positive Grassmannian.  This project will explore a myriad of generalizations of the objects mentioned above, and will significantly improve our understanding of: the dimer model on non-planar graphs; limiting behaviors of the dimer model on a torus and other surfaces; the connection between dimers on a torus and brane tilings in string theory; soliton solutions to the KP equation and the bipartite graphs realizable as soliton graphs; the relationship between convex polygon tilings and the corresponding bipartite planar graphs with Kasteleyn weightings; the connection between the dimer model and triangulations of the amplituhedron, an object whose volume computes scattering amplitudes; and higher-dimensional dimer models, colored quivers and a generalized notion of cluster mutation, exciting new objects motivated by dualities in supersymmetric quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principal investigator is particularly interested in the interplay between those fields and bringing tools from one field to another in order to open new paths of research, push the boundary of knowledge, and offer new point of views. Many of the investigated problems are motivated by the need to develop theories in spaces which are not regular (like fractals or rough metric spaces). Some of those problems are motivated by physics, engineering and mathematical finance. The principal investigator will also continue his synergistic activities including blogging, organizing conferences, giving lectures and mini-courses on recent advances, and mentoring graduate students.<br/><br/>A first and most important part of the research activity evolves around the understanding of curvature bounds in spaces for which such notions have so far been elusive. In the class of sub-Riemannian manifolds, the principal investigator and his collaborators are interested in developing a comparison geometry with respect to constant curvature model spaces. This includes the study of sub-Laplacian comparison theorems, measure contraction properties and diameter estimates. In the class of Dirichlet spaces, the principal investigator and his collaborators are interested in isoperimetric inequalities and the related study of sets of finite perimeter and bounded variation functions. A second part of the research project deals with problems in the theory of random rough paths. Rough paths theory is a recent theory that allows to define integrals with respect to any Holder regular path.

These mathematical systems incorporate also random unpredictability. The goal is to discover general mathematical laws that govern such systems. These systems appear quite different at small scales and large scales. So it is important to understand how different rules for small-scale evolution lead to different large-scale system-wide behavior. Real-world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion of vehicles, packets in a communication network, fluid particles in a tube, wetting transitions where fluid spreads in a porous medium, epidemics advancing in a population, or the fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid.  Over the long term understanding complex interactions has profound implications for science and engineering and thereby for society. Mathematical systems of the kind described in the proposal are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers. <br/><br/><br/>This project investigates mathematical models of growth and motion in random media. Examples include first-passage percolation, the corner growth model, random walk in random environment, and directed polymer models. The objectives of this work are mathematically rigorous descriptions of the behavior of these models and the development of robust tools for their analysis.  Specific goals include regularity of limit shapes, properties of optimal paths such as their length, fluctuations and geometric features, descriptions of large scale limits in terms of variational formulas and entropy, and descriptions of probability distributions of complicated random geometric objects such as trees of geodesics and competition interfaces.

In the spirit of the great David Hilbert, our project is problem-driven. As he said over one hundred years ago, ''As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long is it alive. [...] It is by the solution of problems that the investigator tests the temper of his steel; he finds new methods and new outlooks, and gains a wider and freer horizon. [...] A mathematical problem should be difficult in order to entice us, yet not completely inaccessible, lest it mock at our efforts.''<br/> <br/>In the case of this project, most of the problems to be considered were posed over sixty years ago by Paul Erdos, the greatest problem poser in history, and are related to the distribution of primes and modular arithmetic. In fact, the energy and momentum of this project will be established by a kickoff conference which will bring together outstanding mathematicians who have done dynamic and useful work on some of his most challenging problems. For many decades, the main problems seemed to be out of reach, but a few years ago Hough and Nielsen proved some breakthrough results. Within the scope of this project, in applying methods of combinatorics and probability theory to solve several major problems that have remained, some new mathematical techniques for their solutions could be derived that might then be applicable to many other problems, including those in number theory. This project has the promise to be impactful in a number of ways within and beyond the discipline. For example, the factorization of integers is of great practical importance in cryptography, and reconstruction problems are likely to be of use in biology (e.g., DNA sequencing).

Devising, analyzing, and benchmarking such algorithms often rely heavily on random matrix and random graph theory, as studies have shown that large network characteristics can often be replicated (and more easily studied) via random graph models. Thus, good theoretical results on the spectra of large random graphs are needed to understand the typical behavior, as well as the limitations of community detection algorithms.<br/><br/>The PI will work on a variety of problems, ranging from the theoretical (spectral of random graphs) to the applied (proposing and analyzing community detection algorithms). Some of the models considered will include the Stochastic Block Model and variants thereof, especially at the limit of sparseness (when average node connectivity is either large and constant or goes to infinity slower than any power of the network size). On the more theoretical side, the PI will work on problems from spectral gap (which controls properties like mixing, but also the possibility of exact community recovery in certain networks) to the empirical spectral distribution (which can be used to establish the nature of the network). The PI will also work on threshold bounds for various regimes of community detection in these graph models, and will produce software for numerically computing the asymptotical spectral distributions for a large variety of random graphs."

One of the challenges in understanding these processes is determining how changes to the combinatorial structure accumulate over time.

It will be the first Quantum Probability Meeting organized in the United States. AQPIDA was established with the intention of promoting the area of Quantum Probability, a mathematical field started by the efforts of John von Neumann, almost simultaneously as Classic Probability was founded by Andrey Kolmogorov. The development of Classic Probability was very fast, but the progress in Quantum Probability was much slower. In the last two decades, great advancement was made in Quantum Probability, specially by mathematicians from Italy, Japan, Korea, and Poland. Our main objective, for organizing this meeting in the United States, is to promote Quantum  Probability among the American mathematicians and scientists. This conference will also give the opportunity to mathematicians working in Classic and Quantum Probability to come together, discuss problems that are of common interest for both groups of people, and eliminate the artificial barriers that separate the two fields. Among the invited people, there are also several physicists, and this will contribute to the refreshing of the traditional collaboration that existed in the past among mathematicians and physicists. <br/><br/>Strict mathematical objectives  include: codifying properties of probability measures, having finite moments of all orders, in terms of their quantum operators: creation, annihilation, and preservation operators, understanding how the commutation relationships that exist among the quantum operators can lead to new physical interpretations about interacting systems, making progress in understanding the quantum Markov chains or fields, understanding how the commutation relationships among the quantum operators affect the kernels of second quantization operators and Wick products, using the kernels to prove sharp inequalities about the norms of Wick products and hypercontractivity inequalities involving the second quantization operators, making progress in understanding the connections of instantons with the ``exotic Laplacians"" (higher order Levy Laplacians), making progress in the development of the theory of quantum Markov semi-groups and of their generators, making progress in the study of quantum networks, and making progress toward building a reliable quantum computer. <br/><br/>The web-site of the conference is the following: https://osumarion.osu.edu/events/icqp.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, quantification of risk of extreme outcomes is of central concern in many problems in finance, economics, environmental science, geophysics, and engineering. The mathematical framework for studying such problems is given by the theory of large deviations which is concerned with the characterization of decay rate of probabilities of deviations of a system with uncertainties from its nominal expected behavior. In the last twenty years a new approach to the study of large deviations problems, that brings to bear techniques from the theory of stochastic control, has become prominent. The goal of this research is to develop a systematic framework based on stochastic control ideas for an important and challenging class of large deviation problems that arise in the study of interacting particle systems. Interacting particle systems considered here are motivated by phenomena in Natural Sciences. Some examples include models for chemotaxis of biological particles, reaction-diffusion systems arising from ecological models, and crystal growth models from chemistry. In addition to developing the mathematical machinery for providing asymptotic bounds on decay rate of rare event probabilities, this work will develop accelerated Monte-Carlo methods for estimating probabilities of interest using methods of importance sampling that are inspired by a large deviation analysis of the underlying systems.<br/><br/><br/>This project will study four different families of particle systems: (A) Weakly interacting diffusions with a small common noise; (B) Microscopic particle models for Patlak-Keller-Segel equations; (C) Brownian particle systems for reaction-diffusion equations; (D) Locally interacting jump-diffusions. Under topic (A), the focus will be on large deviation asymptotics as the number of particles becomes large and the intensity of the common noise becomes small. The goal is to characterize different forms of large deviation behavior as the two parameters approach limits at different relative rates. Patlak-Keller-Segal equations in topic (B) are nonlinear non-local PDE that model active chemotaxis of biological particles. Interacting diffusive particle systems that are fully coupled with the evolution of the underlying chemical field have been used to give a mesoscopic description of the phenomenon. Goal of the proposed research here is to study large deviation problems aimed at understanding the long time behavior of such particle systems. In particular, this work will study invariant measure asymptotics and metastability behavior near a rest point. Under topic (C), large deviations behavior of particle systems of reaction-diffusion type will be studied. Of particular interest are annihilating Brownian particles approximating reaction diffusion equations with a polynomial reaction term in which the interaction becomes singular in the limit. Finally topic (D) is concerned with locally interacting particle systems on discrete lattices with a suitable temporal and spatial scaling.

Much of the research in probability and statistical physics involves investigating random structures equipped with spatial geometry, expected to model some natural phenomena as above and others. The research program outlined in the project aims to study a wide range of problems around various aspects of such random spatial models including correlation structure, scaling limits, phase transitions as certain natural parameters are varied, convergence to equilibrium as well as behavior in the large deviation regimes. While the main focus is on developing novel ideas in probability theory, a key goal is to merge perspectives and develop new bridges between various areas of mathematics, statistical physics and theoretical computer science. The program also has a significant education component including curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/><br/>The project broadly discusses three topics. The first theme includes models of random growth exhibiting a global smoothing mechanism in presence of local roughening forces believed to exhibit certain universal behavior predicted in a seminal paper by Kardar, Parisi and Zhang (KPZ). The PI will study models of  planar last and first passage percolation, which puts random weights  on the vertices of a planar lattice and considers paths between vertices which accrue maximum or minimum energies respectively, and are believed to be canonical examples in the KPZ universality class.  There has been an explosion of activity, mostly around a handful of examples of such models, which are integrable, admitting certain remarkable bijections to algebraic objects such as random matrices, Young diagrams and so on. The PI will pursue a geometric perspective and develop probabilistic tools to study spatial and temporal correlation behavior for such models as well as how the geometry of optimal paths change in large deviation regimes.  The second theme concerns models of self  organized criticality where systems under their natural evolution converge to a critical state without external tuning of parameters. Continuing previous work, the PI will investigate long standing conjectures about phase transitions on infinite lattices and quantitative estimates for finite versions, for the stochastic sandpile model and activated random walk, two paradigm examples of self-organized criticality. The study of evolving self-similar interfaces of related multi-type Laplacian growth models where growth rate is governed by harmonic measure of random walk is also proposed. The final topic is about the study of exponents related to rate of escape, spectral behavior and convergence to equilibrium for random walks and finite Markov chains. Examples considered include models of particles diffusing under gravity in a random evolving potential with connections to fluid mechanics, random walks on random fractal graphs as well as a class of non-monotone spin systems modeling the 'cage effect' in glassy dynamics, with connections to random walk on matrices and oriented percolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, randomness is a key component in many algorithms used to process and understand big data.  Crucial to analyzing such models and algorithms is understanding precisely how the randomness and nonlinear effects, i.e. the excitation, combine to relax the system to equilibrium.  The research supported by this award will seek to quantify rates of convergence to equilibrium in a number of models in statistical physics, turbulence and molecular dynamics, especially in those systems used in random sampling algorithms.  The project includes collaborations with high school, undergraduate and graduate students, the results of which will be disseminated through publications and through presentations at domestic and international conferences.  <br/><br/>This award supports several projects at the interface of stochastic analysis and dynamics.  The first part of this research focuses on extracting explicit rates of convergence to equilibrium for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in random sampling algorithms.  Of particular importance is understanding the precise nature of convergence in high dimensions in the presence of singular coefficients in the equations.  Such singularities arise naturally in the context of molecular dynamics (e.g. Lennard-Jones, Coloumb potential functions) as they are used to describe repulsive effects as particles approach one another.  Although natural from a modeling and statistical standpoint, the singularities lead to challenges in both analyzing the dynamics itself as well as in analyzing the corresponding numerical simulation due to energy spikes generated by the singular interactions.  The second part focuses on studying large-time properties of various statistical models in turbulence.  In each of these models, there is also a source of energy often leading to interesting effects in equilibrium such as, for example, heavy-tailed invariant measures.

One of the most interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the resulting ensemble. A simple example of this is the water/ice transition under a pressure gradient induced by gravity. The principal investigator proposes to study mathematical models of such behavior in a variety of basic settings, in hopes of understanding their common features and to be able to predict similar behavior in other potentially more complex systems.<br/><br/>The notion of limit shape in probability describes the property of large random systems to settle into a fixed, nonrandom state in the limit of large system size. Typically limit shapes arise due to a combination of entropic considerations and energy minimization. Several diverse areas where limit shapes have been shown to arise are in the theory of random graphs with subgraph density constraints, random tilings with imposed boundary conditions, and random configurational models such as ""square ice."" These examples are all studied through variational formulations. By studying their common features the PI hopes to learn more about the limit shape phenomenon in general."

The systems studied in this project are representative of natural phenomena, such as crystal growths, evolution of magnetic domains, paths evolving in a noisy environment, and randomly stirred fluids. Often these systems exhibit nonlinearity and criticality. Nonlinearity refers to the behavior that the randomness of the macroscopic observables are related to the underlying microscopic randomness in a nonlinear fashion. Criticality refers to the phenomenon that a given system exhibits drastically distinct macroscopic behaviors when certain parameters in the underlying microscopic model reach some critical values. Time-evolutionary stochastic systems form a large body of probability theory, yet the type of phenomena considered here sits on the frontiers of current standard theories. The goal of this project is to unveil the mathematical structure pertaining to the aforementioned scopes, and to refine the existing theories to study these systems.<br/><br/>In concrete terms, the project studies three types of models: interacting particles with moving boundaries, stochastic partial differential equaitons (SPDEs) at their criticality, and stochastic six vertex-types models. Particle systems with moving boundaries give rise to Stefan?s problem in PDE, and in one particular case those systems relate to the critical point of a reaction-diffusion particle system. The principal investigator seeks to develop more robust tools that do not require explicit stationary distributions and apply to the aforementioned critical point. SPDEs exhibit criticality for certain parameters, where the solutions become non-measurable with respect to the driving noise. This research aims at studying the correlation functions, regularity, and local properties of a few specific examples of such SPDEs. The stochastic six-vertex model is a specialization of the ice-type models that can be formulated as a Markov process. It hosts a number of degenerations, including the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. As a first step toward understanding the limiting shape of these models, the principal investigator plans to study the large deviations utilizing the Markov structures of these models."

The transformations in question include several versions of the Hilbert transform on the integers in dimension one and on the lattice in several dimensions. These basic transformations were introduced by David Hilbert at the beginning of the 20th century as simpler models of their continuous counterparts. For many applications, discrete models are much simpler from the point of view of computations. One of the goals of the project is to show that the magnitudes of the discrete transformations, as measured by certain summability properties of the sequences they transform, coincide with those of their continuous counterparts. Related geometric problems concerning the long time behavior of Brownian motion and more general stochastic processes under certain natural constrains, will be studied as well.<br/><br/>The project deals with several problems and conjectures for sharp inequalities which lie at the interface of probability, harmonic analysis and spectral, potential theoretic, and geometric properties of the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian. A problem of significant interest in the early part of the 20th century was the question of how the size of a periodic function controls the size of its conjugate, where the size is measured by the Lebesgue Lp-norm, where p is strictly between 1 and infinity. In 1925, M. Riesz answered this question in his celebrated paper on the Lp boundedness of the Hilbert transform and showed that this implies the same for the discrete version acting on the space of doubly infinite sequences in little lp. Shortly thereafter, E.C. Titchmarsh gave a direct proof of the boundedness of the discrete Hilbert transform and showed that the norms of these two operators are equal. The following year Titchmarsh pointed out that his argument for equality was incorrect. The question of equality had been a long-standing open problem since 1927. In a recent publication, M. Kwasnicki and the PI solved this problem by identifying the sharp lp bound for the discrete Hilbert transform which turns out to be the same as the sharp Lp bound found for the continuous version found by Pichorides in the early 70's. The first part of this project discusses closely related problems for discrete operators in one and several dimensions.

A second class of problems involves extending and developing a theory of lower bounds on fluctuations of random variables. Understanding fluctuations of random variables is one of the basic goals of probability theory, but there are many important problems where existing methods do not give desirable results. The PI aims to make some progress in this area by providing a new set of tools.

The strategy of working on problems in varied areas of probability theory at the same time has the potential of uncovering new connections.<br/><br/>The problems concerning the KPZ evolution are mainly about producing a solution of the equation in 2D. This would be an important breakthrough because the task of constructing any solution for the 2D KPZ equation has remained intractable so far. The results about fluctuation lower bounds would give the optimal conditions under which the current best lower bounds can be proved for planar growth models.  Previously, such lower bounds required restrictive conditions. The proposed method of solution is based on a novel coupling, which may be of independent interest. The research on ultrametricity will shed light on the hierarchical organization of states in spin glass models, especially for models with full replica symmetry breaking.

Understanding of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, which concerns many surfaces growing with local randomness, has been greatly advanced by many mathematicians and physicists over the last forty years. Often these advances have been aided by the use of integrable techniques, in which sometimes rather special models are analyzed via algebraic tools or exact formulas. The Principal Investigator will analyze certain important universality classes, including the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class, by using probabilistic proof methods in unison with limited but crucial integrable inputs. The structure of certain random fractal  geometries arising in scaling limits of dynamics on random media will thus be explicated.<br/> <br/><br/>The proposed probabilistic investigation of fractal geometries has three principal components. The first concerns anomalous transport in disordered random media. Namely, when a particle with a uniform tendency to move in a preferred direction does so in a milieu that is random and strongly disordered,  trapping is a vital phenomenon that interrupts and sometimes eliminates linear progress. The phenomenon will be elucidated by a detailed inquiry into biased motion on the infinite cluster of supercritical percolation in the integer lattice of dimensions at least two. The second direction concerns scaled last passage percolation. Rich aspects of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality will be explored by studying the scaled random geometry of extremal paths moving through random fields using probabilistic modes of proof such as resampling of random energy profiles and surgery on paths.

In every instance, the issue of model error is important.  In general, it is not possible for practical reasons (such as limited amounts of data, or the need to maintain computational feasibility) to work with a perfectly accurate model.  Hence it is important to identify those aspects of the model that are uncertain, quantify their impact on predictions, and perhaps even account for this uncertainty while using the model, for example as an engineering tool.  The models of interest in this project are probabilistic.  In this setting we acknowledge that the system is random, and the model error is due to an imperfect understanding of the parameters that describe the probability distribution.  To assess how mathematical predictions based on the model change as the model itself changes, one needs metrics to compare the outcome based on different distributions (e.g., the distribution that is used for ""design,"" and an ideal but not available ""true"" distribution).  The topic of this research is the development of the theory and application of such metrics.  In contrast to prior work, here we focus on situations where the quantities of interest are tied to rare events, such as a catastrophic system failure.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the use of divergences and metrics on probability measures to study model uncertainty, and optimization and control in the presence of model uncertainty.  The probability measures are typically on high-dimensional or complicated spaces, and typically on a path space to model stochastic dynamics.  An important aspect of the work is to establish useful qualitative properties, such as scaling limits and chain rule-type formulas.  In contrast to prior work, the focus here is on situations where (a) one wishes to consider differing models that are not absolutely continuous, and (b) performance measures and quantities of interest are largely determined by rare events and tail properties.  The main mathematical tools used are convex duality or variational formulas that relate the divergences to exponential integrals.  To implement the theory, one needs to evaluate such exponential integrals, which for example may take the form of a moment-generating function with respect to the stationary distribution of some Markov process.  The project also considers the design and analysis of Monte Carlo methods for this class of problems.

Ergodic theory studies abstractly what kinds of randomness are possible in such a process, where two processes are regarded as equivalent if either can be obtained by a suitable encoding of the other.  However, many random phenomena of great importance in modern coding theory, statistics, and data science do not arise in the linear fashion that is dictated by the arrow of time in a stationary process.  Rather, they are structured according to a large underlying network, which may itself be highly disordered.  The current project seeks to adapt methods of ergodic theory to this new setting or understand why they fail and then develop replacements.  For models of randomness governed by underlying disordered networks, some of the main issues to be investigated include: (i) whether the broad statistical features scale in a simple way with the size of the network; (ii) whether the random behavior that is visible at a particular node of the network can be estimated easily from the parameters of the model; (iii) how one can determine effectively whether a given model of network randomness can be re-encoded in some simpler form, such as pure independent noise at each node.  All of these issues arise in the theoretical underpinnings of modern research in computer and data science and could serve as a guide towards new discoveries in those fields.  The pursuit of these questions requires background knowledge from diverse parts of probability and pure mathematics, and so the current project includes plans to develop educational materials and train graduate students in a novel but valuable mix of those disciplines.<br/><br/>The project has two more specific aims. The first is the further development of the methods in the principal investigator's recent proof of the weak Pinsker theorem in ergodic theory. This theorem asserts that any stationary ergodic process may be re-encoded, in the sense of measure-theoretic isomorphism, into a nearly deterministic component and a purely random component.  The methods from the proof apply to the joint distribution of a stationary sequence of random variables, deriving a structural description from some basic information-theoretic parameters of a joint distribution.  Such implications are still in their infancy, and the proposed project would explore a range of related parameters and their consequences. The second aim concerns the broad and important class of joint distributions in combinatorics and statistical physics that are constructed over locally tree-like graphs. These models provide examples of measure-preserving actions of free groups, and conversely methods from free-group ergodic theory help to describe their asymptotic behavior. The physics literature predicts novel and consequential phenomena such as shattering and condensation, but only a few special cases have been established rigorously. The project will explore these phenomena using notions and methods from ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the age of large data, classical probability theory does not offer sufficient tools for current applications in large data. One of the most basic objects in data analysis is large random matrices representing data and noise. The statistics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices essentially determine the real information contained in the data matrices. In this work, we aim to develop tools in understanding the eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics of the large class of random matrices. Besides data matrices, the research also investigates the spectral properties of the associated matrices of large random graphs. In order to enhance the exchange of ideas among different groups of researchers, we have been running seminars jointly with the Statistics and Computer Science departments at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications at Harvard University. We also co-organize the Charles River Lectures in Probability (jointly with MIT and Microsoft Research), the Current Development in Mathematics conference (jointly with MIT), and the CMSA's annual conference on Big Data. These programs will bring researchers from probability theory, statistics, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and computer science to work together. We are actively formulating mathematical questions that are interesting to statisticians and computer scientists. It is clear that the analysis of large random matrices is of great interest to these scientists and we expect fruitful results from these collaborations. <br/><br/>This research aims to extend random matrix statistics to large classes of matrix models, including band matrices, adjacency matrices of sparse random graphs, and heavy-tailed random matrices. Our goal is to understand to what extent random matrix statistics, in particular the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, can be shown to hold independent of the matrix law. Our work is driven by the grand vision of E. Wigner, asserting that random matrix statistics are universal laws for systems of high complexity. More precisely, we choose the following five projects: 1. Delocalization and universality of band matrices. 2. Quantum unique ergodicity and data analysis. 3. Edge statistics of sparse random graphs. 4. Levy matrices and heavy-tailed random matrices. 5. Spin glass dynamics on hypercubes. The first project aims to extend the current random matrix theory to non mean-field models since most basic physics laws are short-ranged and thus far from the mean field type. Project 1 concerning non mean-field band matrices is in our view one of the most important questions regarding <br/>Wigner's original vision. Projects 2 and 3 concern edge statistics of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of random sparse graphs. Due to a Gaussian to Tracy-Widom transition in the edge statistics for the Erdos-Renyi graphs, we expect this project to clarify the role of sparsity in random graphs. In addition, our understanding of eigenvector statistics will have applications in restricted minimum singular value problems and signal recovery algorithms. Project 4 aims to classify the phase diagrams of heavy-tailed random matrices according to their spectral statistics. The last project aims to develop methods to prove spectral gaps and logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the Glauber dynamics of spin glasses on hypercubes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, cellular processes, fluctuations in stock prices, weather patterns, movement of microscopic particles exhibit different types of random behaviors. Furthermore, randomness is a vital ingredient in most modern algorithms that are popular in data-science.  Hence, it is of fundamental importance that various types of randomness are properly characterized for detailed understanding of system properties. Mathematical models incorporating such randomness are typically expressed in terms of stochastic equations, which often have complex dynamics.  An important component of mathematical studies of these equations includes computer simulations of their temporal evolution, which are necessary for understanding their behavioral patterns over time. Accurate statistical estimation of some key parameters of these stochastic equations from observed data is also crucial, as it leads to the ""most appropriate mathematical model"" underlying these data points. This in turn leads to better predictive power of such models. The research supported by this award will undertake proper mathematical analyses of various numerical schemes that are used for these purposes. More specifically, research in this direction will involve precise calculations of probabilities of getting accurate results from these schemes and will describe conditions under which these probabilities are very high. There is a critical need for such theoretical results, since they will inevitably lead to design of faster and more efficient algorithms, which in turn will be beneficial to society. The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will help them to gain valuable analytical and computational skills. The results of the project will be published in well-known scientific journals and will also be presented at domestic and international conferences. <br/> <br/>The research will focus on the limiting behaviors of complex stochastic systems discretized by properly scaled step sizes. Discretization is at the heart of various numerical schemes, but its effect on the desired convergence properties is not always clearly understood. For example, it is well known that approximating stationary distribution of an ergodic stochastic differential equation (SDE) by time averages of sample paths obtained from an Euler-Maruyama type discretization scheme (using fixed step-size) could be problematic. In particular, such an estimator will have a bias, which may or may not be quantifiable. These are infinite-time horizon problems, and there is a deficit of proper asymptotic results in this direction even for regular Ito-diffusions. Exploring proper scaling techniques to get desired convergence along with convergence rates for such discretization-based schemes is the central goal of this project. Stochastic models that will be considered covers switching jump-diffusion models, multiscale systems and systems of interacting SDEs with possible jumps. The last class is particularly important for understanding particle-based methods for approximating nonlinear integro-differential equations including Boltzmann-type equations. These equations are connected to appropriate systems of interacting SDEs with jumps through McKean-Vlasov type limits. The stochastic equations of interest will also include Langevin SDEs, which model dynamics of molecular systems in presence of particle interaction potential, damping and random forces, and which also play a pivotal role in certain Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms.  The research puts special emphasis on large deviation asymptotics of error probabilities, which, importantly, because of presence of both upper and lower bounds, give the optimal exponential decay rate. <br/> <br/>This project is jointly funded by Probability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For low dimensional time series, there is a well-developed estimation and inference theory. Inference theory in the high dimensional setting is of fundamental importance and has wide applications, but has been rarely studied. Researchers face a number of challenges in solving real-world problems: (i) complex dynamics of data generating systems, (ii) temporal and cross-sectional dependencies, (iii) high dimensionality and (iv) non-Gaussian distributions. The goal of this project is to develop and advance inference theory for high dimensional time series data by concerning all the above characteristics. The project will provide training to graduate students and publicly avaialble statistical packages. <br/><br/>This project involves developing a systematic asymptotic theory for estimation and inference for high dimensional time series, including parameter estimation, construction of simultaneous confidence intervals, prediction, model selection, Granger causality test, hypothesis testing, and spectral domain estimation. To this end, a new methodology for the estimation of parameters and second-order characteristics for high dimensional time series will be proposed. New tools and concentration inequalities for the asymptotic analysis of high-dimensional time series will be developed. To perform simultaneous inference and significance testing, the PIs will investigate the very deep Gaussian approximation problem and the high dimensional central limit theorems by taking both high dimensionality and temporal and cross-sectional dependencies into account.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite these impressive successes, it is not clear why neural nets work so well. In this project, the PI will use tools from probability to develop our theoretical understanding of neural networks. The goal is to give us a deep understanding of why neural nets are so efficient at overcoming challenges in optimization and high-dimensional data analysis. These theoretical insights will, in turn, inform the intuition of engineers for building the next generation of neural net-based machine learning systems. <br/><br/>Mathematically, the study of neural networks is a cross between approximation theory and optimization, touching on topics from random matrix theory, Gaussian processes, hyperplane arrangements, tensor decompositions, and optimal transport, to name a few. The PI will focus specifically on (i) the stability of gradient-based optimization of neural networks to both the linear statistics and spectral asymptotics of random matrix ensembles given by products of many random matrices in the regime where both the number of terms in the product and the sizes of the matrices simultaneously group, and (ii) computing the correlation functions of neural networks at initialization (e.g. with random weights and biases). Questions of type (i) give quantitative information on the numerical stability of neural network architectures at initialization. Questions of type (ii), in contrast, aim at principles for data-driven architecture selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its primary goals are to analyze phase transitions: for example liquid-to-solid transitions where the physical properties of a substance change abruptly.  The dimer model was originally conceived as a simplified model of two-dimensional matter in which phase transitions can be studied. Recent work, however, has linked the model to many other areas of mathematics, from combinatorics to string theory, where ''brane dimers'' are proposed as fundamental descriptions of spacetime at small scales.  The PIs propose to jointly investigate a number of interrelated topics in mathematics and physics, each of which has the dimer model as its underlying combinatorial structure. This project will lead to the organization of workshops and regular meetings of the PIs and their graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, continuing the PIs' efforts to get young mathematicians and physicists involved in these topics.  The PIs will contribute to the mathematical community through their mentorship of young scholars, research talks in conferences and workshops, papers published in peer-reviewed journals, and books on a selection of these topics.<br/><br/>The dimer model studies the set of all dimers, or perfect matchings, on a planar bipartite graph G on a disk or Riemann surface. Despite the simple definition, there are many open problems about the dimer model, as well as applications to geometry, algebra, and physics. There is a fundamental connection between the dimer model on the disk and the Grassmannian, via the fact that generating functions of dimers satisfy Plucker relations. This fact leads to the cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian, and the beautiful combinatorics of the positive Grassmannian.  This project will explore a myriad of generalizations of the objects mentioned above, and will significantly improve our understanding of: the dimer model on non-planar graphs; limiting behaviors of the dimer model on a torus and other surfaces; the connection between dimers on a torus and brane tilings in string theory; soliton solutions to the KP equation and the bipartite graphs realizable as soliton graphs; the relationship between convex polygon tilings and the corresponding bipartite planar graphs with Kasteleyn weightings; the connection between the dimer model and triangulations of the amplituhedron, an object whose volume computes scattering amplitudes; and higher-dimensional dimer models, colored quivers and a generalized notion of cluster mutation, exciting new objects motivated by dualities in supersymmetric quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
