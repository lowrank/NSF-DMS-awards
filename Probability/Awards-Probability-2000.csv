Percolation theory has a variety of applications to solid physics, biology, computer science, and geology.  A percolation process typically depends on one or more parameters, and a dramatic change in physical  properties may occur as a critical parameter value is passed.  This research will focus on the behaviors of percolative models in the following three areas: percolation model, first passage percolation model, and the percolative process.  More precisely, the research makes use of probability theory  (the moment estimations, the ergodic theory, correlation and martingale inequalities and stochastic ordering), the CLT theorem, graph theory (duality, the fractal dimension), combinatorics (partition lattices, distributive lattices), and functional analysis (the real analyticity).  The project will use these mathematical tools to advance in a rigorous understanding of the critical phenomena.<br/><br/>This project concentrates on percolation, a mathematical model used to describe transitions of physical systems.  Percolation theory has a variety of applications to solid physics, biology, computer science, and geology.  A percolation process typically depends on one or more parameters, and a dramatic change in physical properties may occur as a critical parameter value is passed.  For example, suppose we immerse a large porous solid in a bucket water.  Clearly, how water penetrates the solid depends on the size of the pores of the solid.  A simple mathematical model of such a process is defined by taking the pores to be distributed in some regular manner, and to be open or closed with probabilities p or 1-p.  There is a critical threshold, for probability at which the behavior changes abruptly, below which the water penetration is only superficial and above which it is arbitrarily deep.  The behavior near the critical threshold is more complicated. One of the most challenging problems is to give a mathematical description of deep penetration near the critical threshold.  This research will focus on three areas: percolation model, first passage percolation model, and percolative process.  In particular, the project will investigate mathematically rigorous exact solutions for the percolation process.  The research makes use of probability theory, graph theory, combinatorics and functional analysis.  The project will use these mathematical tools to advance in a rigorous understanding of the critical phenomena.<br/>"

The first type includes the exclusion and zero-range processes, while the second type covers variants of the ""Wiener Sausage"" model.  Three categories of problems are focused upon in these systems: Tagged particle problems in conservative particle systems, current fluctuations at a fixed location in the exclusion model, and localization structure of long time surviving Brownian paths in trap settings.<br/>Stochastic dynamical systems following the motion of a collection of particles have been successful in the modeling of diverse physical phenomena such as fluid and traffic flow, queuing, chemical trapping behavior, etc.  Several theoretical studies have been made on ""first-order"" calculations, which describe the dominant modes of objects of interest, for instance, average velocities or trap survival probabilities.  The intent of this project is to supply the ""second-order"" characteristics in these fluid and traffic models.  The significance of second-order calculations is that they provide a measure of the robustness of the first-order approximations in applications.   Aside from this general notion, the computations involved in this project would shed light on the intrinsic physics of the random media models studied.  Also, from the mathematical view, the solution techniques of these challenging problems would be of great value themselves for future endeavors."

The first problem involves reflected Brownian motion in time-dependent domains and the corresponding heat equation with the Neumann boundary conditions. The main emphasis is on the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the heat equation and the reflected Brownian motion, and on the singularities of the heat equation solutions close to the moving boundary. The second part of the project is concerned with stochastic flows related to singular stochastic differential equations. Flows of this type have interesting combinatorial properties not present in flows corresponding to equations with smooth coefficients. The ""hot spot"" conjecture states that hottest point in an insulated body lies on its boundary. While this is not true in general, it is a widespread belief that the conjecture holds in convex domains. The PIs are currently studying symmetric convex domains. Finally, stable processes and related processes are studied from the point of view of potential theory.<br/> Stochastic analysis was one of the most important developments on the borderline of probability and analysis in the twentieth century. It now provides the basis of studying fundamental properties of real life phenomena which are random by nature. One of the most spectacular recent successes of the theory is the so-called financial mathematics. This theory provides a solid theoretical basis for trading securities - its founding fathers were recently recognized by a Nobel Prize in Economics. Stable processes, one of the topics of the project, are more and more often applied in financial mathematics and other applied sciences because the traditional continuous models are not always adequate. The study of a singular flow was directly inspired by a collaboration of one of the PIs (Burdzy) with economists, published in a leading journal ""Econometrics."" The study of reflected Brownian motion in time dependent domains is reminiscent of the ""Stefan problem"" concerned with melting ice. Similar physical models are of great interest to scientists who model real life environmental changes.<br/>"

Economic development, new technologies, and population pressure have escalated the scale, frequency, and severity of such perturbations. As a result, evolutionary and ecological dynamics may be driven so far from their equilibria that the linear approximations used for understanding and predicting consequences of subtle perturbations are inappropriate and probably misleading. To elucidate the consequences of massive perturbations in biological communities, a spatially explicit model whose dynamics are complicated by ecological, genetic, and historical factors, is proposed. Studies on (i) corn smut and corn, (ii) rhizobia associated with common bean, (iii) corn borer and genetically modified Bt and non-Bt corn, and (iv) prairie plants and their pollinators provide the empirical basis that are framed by the general model of interactions between hosts and their associates.  A hierarchy of models at different spatial scales will determine the evolutionary and ecological role of different factors at the different spatial scales.  In addition, statistical tools are used to develop and analyze data of genetic diversity under non-equilibrium conditions using both temporal and spatial information.<br/><br/>Understanding the complex interactions between the members of communities undergoing such massive perturbations and their evolutionary and ecological consequences requires the integration of empirical work and mathematical models across temporal and spatial scales. The empirical studies represent examples of large perturbations that occurred either in the past (as in (i) and (ii)) or in the present (as in (iii) and (iv)).  The historical studies allow testing the predictability of the theoretical models to assess the accuracy of the predictions for the consequences of massive perturbations that occur presently. The perturbations consist (1) of the introduction of novel organisms or (2) of habitat destruction, both at a large spatial scale: Corn and beans were moved from South and Central America to North America in the past carrying with them microorganism that, after introduction, competed with already present microorganisms.  Bt corn is currently being introduced in North America as a control mechanism for the European corn borer, a devastating pest of corn; Bt corn is introduced at a large spatial scale that introduces large selection pressure on the evolution of resistance to Bt corn, which will make this control mechanism ineffective. Habitat destruction is an ongoing process affecting nearly every natural community in North America and in other parts of the world leading to loss in biodiversity. The goal is to predict the evolutionary and ecological consequences of large range expansions and contractions of plants on their associated biological communities in order to better manage natural and agricultural systems."

The spatial processes will be modeled using the framework of interacting particle systems, which are continuous time Markov processes on the infinite D dimensional lattice, characterized by local interactions between sites. The genealogical processes will be investigated using the ancestral selection graph as a modeling framework.<br/> The motivation for the proposed research is to gain a better understanding of how spatial and temporal factors affect the outcome of interactions in plant communities. Most of ecological and agricultural modeling traditionally did not take into account effects of explicit space due to the difficulties encountered in the analysis of such models. More recently, tools have been developed that allow rigorous analysis of spatial models. This research of Dr. Neuhauser is intended to shed light on how space affects plant communities; this is important in understanding the structure of both natural and managed (agricultural) communities.

The unifying thrust is the study of mathematical models of biological systems at the population level. The interplay between various genetic influences such as mutation, selection, and population structure can sometimes confound one's ability to draw valid inference. The first goal is to develop methods of estimation and inference for complex molecular genetic data arising from populations with various kinds of structure. The investigators explore sampling distributions and likelihood methods in the presence of these confounding effects. The second goal involves the study of genealogical processes (i.e., coalescent theory) for populations which are subject to various selective forces, geographical segregation, or other hierarchical structuring. Both sampling theory and coalescent methods provide a framework for computational methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling. The third goal is to study spatial interactions which arise in ecology and epidemiology using interacting particle systems. The problems addressed include several new nonlinear voter models with a cluster-breaking feature and new work on the two-stage contact process, with applications to metapopulation models.<br/> Previous models of the ecology and genetics of natural populations have been based on many simplifying assumptions. It is now important to produce more realistic models to address ecological and evolutionary problems that impact society. In addition to the inherent randomness in real biological systems, spatial structure is often of critical importance. Examples of these problems include the evolution and spread of infectious diseases, invasions of exotic species, and survival of species in fragmented habitats. Furthermore, the technical revolution in gene sequencing is producing huge data sets that can only be deciphered in a sophisticated mathematical framework. The new field of bioinformatics relies heavily on an evolutionary perspective. This interdisciplinary work is part of an ongoing effort to develop and employ new mathematical methods for the purpose of addressing these complex biological problems at the population level. <br/>"

The first is the question of uniqueness for diffusions on fractals. For infinitely ramified fractals such as the Sierpinski carpet it is not yet known whether all possible constructions of Brownian motion whose state space is the fractal lead to the same process. This problem has applications to mathematical physics. Another concerns applying probabilistic techniques to the hot spots problem, a difficult problem in analysis. The hot spots problem is to determine where the solution to the heat equation with reflecting boundaries takes its maximum. A third problem is the estimation of the heat kernel, a problem that is related to partial differential equations. The heat equation for elliptic operators in divergence form has a fundamental solution that is comparable to that for the Laplacian. Is this true when the state space is not Euclidean space, but rather a more general manifold?<br/> Several problems in probability theory will be studied. They are all related to analysis and partial differential equations, in particular, to the heat equation. The heat equation governs the flow of heat as well as many other physical quantities. Interestingly enough, the study of random processes such as Brownian motion, can shed a great deal of light on the solutions of the heat equation in various media.<br/>"

A main thrust of the research aims at deepening our understanding of canonical $U$-statistics and $U$-processes by investigating exponential and moment inequalities (what are the true analogues for $U$-statistics of the Rosenthal-Pinelis and Bernstein's inequalities? is there a uniform Bernstein, or uniform Prohorov inequality such as the recent inequality of Talagrand for collections of sums of independent random variables?) and limit theorems, particularly the law of the iterated logarithm.  These results may be obtained for generalized $U$-statistics, including multilinear forms in independent random variables.  Applications of these topics in Statistics, particularly censored data, will also be pursued.  A second object of study are selfnormalized sums of independent random variables, particularly in connection with the bootstrap and with the Student t-statistic.  Finally, the P.I. is also interested in exploring the application of the modern theory of empirical processes and its techniques in different areas such as asymptotics of the fluctuations of the occupation measure process for multiple particle systems, and estimation and testing based on different functionals of the empirical process.<br/> The empirical measure is shorthand for the description of a series of data points.  Sums of independent random variables and empirical processes can be thought of as single integrals of functions of one variable with respect to this measure, and $U$-statistics and $U$-processes, as multiple integrals with respect to the empirical measure of functions of several variables.  First order asymptotic statistics is often based on limit theorems for sums of independent random variables and processes, but more refined second order properties require limit theory for $U$-statistics and processes (in a way, in analogy with the use of higher order derivatives versus only the first derivative when studying functions in Calculus).  Although $U$-statistics were introduced in the forties, their asymptotic theory has not been close to reaching its final form until recently, in part due to previous efforts by this P.I. and collaborators; the proposed research aims at completing this chapter of Classical Probability for $U$-statistics, and at advancing the theory of $U$-processes, by obtaining best possible distributional and moment inequalities and laws of the iterated logarithm.  This research will also include applications in survival analysis. In another direction, it is accepted wisdom that normalizing sums of independent random variables by certain quantities that depend on themselves rather than numerical constants improves the convergence properties (in particular, then, statistical procedures based on such selfnormalized quantities may have good properties, the leading and oldest example of this being the famous Student t-statistic and test).  But this must be shown at each instance.  The P.I. would like to study some questions related to selfnormalized sums, particularly in connection with the bootstrap.  Empirical process theory vigorously developed during the last two decades (with substantial contributions by this P.I.) and, since then, its impact on different fields of stochastics has not ceased to increase (in classical asymptotic statistics, information theory, neural networks, machine learning, model selection, statistical mechanics, etc.), and the P.I. would like to continue applying it to different statistics and probability problems of current interest.<br/>"

The network models being considered are heterogeneous, may have complex feedback mechanisms, and allow for stochastic variability in arrivals, service times and routing. Buffers in the network enable jobs to be stored that cannot be served immediately. In addition, the models with control allow for dynamic sequencing and alternate routing of jobs. Since the complexity of these network models usually precludes exact analysis, the focus is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation are being considered, namely fluid models (first order approximations) and diffusion models (second order approximations). Investigating the interplay between these models is an important feature of the research. The two main topics are (i) dynamic control through sequencing and alternate routing, and (ii) performance analysis for processor sharing networks. With regard to topic (i), some authors have successfully used diffusion control problems as formal tools for generating good control policies for some specific network models. However, there are few rigorous analyses of the performance of such policies. The PI is developing a systematic approach to finding and interpreting solutions of diffusion control problems and to analyzing the performance of the policies generated in this manner. Regarding topic (ii), the processor sharing discipline is an example of a service discipline for which a natural state descriptor involves a measure-valued process (to keep track of the residual service times of all jobs in the network). The PI is studying fluid and diffusion approximations of processor sharing networks with the aims of understanding the dynamics of such networks, obtaining measures of performance, and developing general tools for studying measure-valued processes associated with network models. <br/> Stochastic networks are used as models for complex manufacturing, telecommunications and computer systems. A challenging problem for such networks is to design controls that are simple to implement and yet are near optimal in an appropriate sense. Motivated by such problems, a number of mathematical questions associated with controlling and analyzing the performance of stochastic networks are being studied under this grant. Since the complexity of stochastic network models usually precludes exact analysis, the focus is on approximate models with a hierarchical structure. As with recent work on the performance analysis of some networks, the interplay between the levels in this hierarchy is an important feature of the research."

These investigations lead to connections of probability to a conjecture of Morrey which asserts that rank--one convexity does not imply quasiconvexity in dimensions larger than 2. Secondly, extremal problems for the hyperbolic metric will be investigated. These problems arise from the conformal invariance of Brownian motion and conditioned Brownian motion in simply connected domains in the plane. These investigations in turn lead to new problems for martingales and Brownian motion. These problems will also be explored.<br/> Morrey's conjecture is important because of its implications in constructing minimizers in several problems in the calculus of variations describing various physical systems. The connection of these problems to probability was discovered by the PI and his collaborator, G. Wang and A.J. Lindeman, while investigating sharp inequalities for stochastic integrals and more general martingales. These connections lead to several questions which if false prove Morrey's's conjecture, a long standing open problem, and if true prove a conjecture concerning the norm of certain singular integrals, another long standing open problem. The solution to the proposed problems on the hyperbolic metric will yield a deeper understanding of various isoperimetric (extremal) inequalities for Brownian motion and conditioned Brownian motion.

In particular, the PI will study situations where the rare behavior conditioned on a fixed (= quenched) realization of one element of randomness is the key to determine and understand the typical phenomena.  One unifying theme is that the evaluation of probabilities of rare events leads to an understanding of the mechanisms by which they can occur, and when many different rare events are possible, it leads to the identification of the mechanism causing one of them to actually occur.  Two specific lines of research are planned: (i) Mathematical study and understanding of ""aging"" phenomenon in the large time behavior of dynamical systems for statistical physics models out of equilibrium; and (ii) Study of exceptional points on the sample path of stochastic processes such as Brownian motion, random walks and stable processes.  Emphasis is put on points defined by means of the corresponding occupation measures of sets of shrinking diameters.  Other directions of proposed research involving these ingredients are applicable among other things to universal lossy coding, a problem of relevance and much interest for communication theory and to biomolecular data analysis.<br/><br/> The theory of large deviations is mainly concerned with rare events or tail estimates on an exponential scale.

Nussbaum, Department of Mathematics, Cornell<br/>University, Ithaca, NY<br/><br/><br/>The concept of asymptotic equivalence of experiments serves to compare<br/>properties of statistical models. An experiment is a family of probability<br/>measures; a distance is defined between these objects such that the<br/>informational content of experiments with respect to the parameter is<br/>similar if this distance is small. This basic deficiency pseudodistance <br/>(or Delta-distance) has been introduced by L. Le Cam, generalizing the<br/>concept of sufficiency. If experiments are equivalent via sufficiency<br/>then their Delta-distance is 0; here equivalence via sufficiency<br/>means that one experiment results from application of a sufficient statistic<br/>to the data of the other.<br/><br/>Based on the idea of the Delta-distance, a theory of local<br/>asymptotic normality (LAN-theory) of experiments has been developed which<br/>has found widespread application in statistics. The idea of data reduction<br/>which is at the heart of the sufficiency concept could thus be combined with<br/>limit theorems of probability, resulting in approximation of general<br/>statistical models by Gaussian shift families. These Gaussian shift or<br/>translation families allow explicit expression for risk bounds in many<br/>instances, and these risk bound then become valid in an asymptotic sense in<br/>the approximated models.<br/><br/>The limitation of the LAN-theory consists in its restriction to a<br/>local setting, in which the rate of localization is tied to the<br/>normalization rate in the central limit theorem (the classical root-n in<br/>most cases). This setting precludes application of the resulting risk bounds<br/>to the class of ill-posed function estimation problems. The emphasis of the<br/>current project is on the treatment of this problem class (which includes<br/>nonparametric density estimation) by methods involving the Delta-distance.<br/><br/>The restriction to a local setting (or alternatively, a finite dimensional<br/>setting) which is inherent in the LAN-theory has been overcome in recent<br/>years, by efforts of Brown and Low (1996) and by various<br/>results of the P.I. and collaborators, starting also in 1996 <br/>(asymptotic equivalence of density estimation and Gaussian white noise). <br/>The main tool has been approximation of general likelihood processes by Gaussian<br/>ones, using coupling methodology. The present project focuses on elaboration<br/>and extension of these results, with two main directions:<br/><br/>(i) constructive realization of equivalence in nonparametric models,<br/>enabling explicit equivalence mappings (direct transfer of decision<br/>functions)<br/><br/>(ii) equivalences in nonparametric models for dependent data (time series<br/>and diffusion process models).<br/><br/>"

For many problems of Convex Geometry, like finding sections of a convex body with certain nice properties or approximating a convex body by another body, having a better structure, the explicit constructions are unknown. In these cases random constructions were proved to be very effective. It is often possible to define a random section or approximation and to show that it has the desired property with high probability. This approach combined with advanced probabilistic tools, like measure concentration, led to major discoveries in Convex geometry and Functional Analysis, including Dvoretzky's Theorem and inverse Santalo Inequality. The PI intends to apply the probabilistic method to study embeddings of different metric spaces, such as groups, graphs etc., into Banach spaces. These metric spaces are often equipped with a probability measure, which has strong concentration properties. Then it is possible to obtain significant information about the embedding of such metric space into a Banach space by studying the distribution of the image of a random point. Another direction of the proposed research is related to the study of convex bodies, which are not necessary symmetric. The results obtained in the last 3 years by several researchers, including the PI, show that many properties, previously known only for convex symmetric bodies, hold without the assumption of symmetry. The PI plans to continue his work in this area with the aim of constructing a theory of general convex bodies, which would be parallel to the existing theory of convex symmetric bodies.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will provide new connections between Functional Analysis, Convex Geometry and Probability. The results on embedding graphs into Banach spaces will be useful for finding small separators of graphs. This can lead to construction of more effective algorithms in several Computer Science problems, in particular in numerical solution of partial differential equations. The non-symmetric convex sets, which are one of the main objects of the proposed research, arise naturally in a broad class of optimization problems. So, better understanding of the structure of such bodies will result in constructing more effective optimization algorithms. The stochastic processes related to a convex body are also of considerable interest for the Control Theory.<br/><br/>"

In a further project the relation between characteristic length and renormalization will be investigated. A project focuses on phase coexistence in Ising-Potts models and it is concerned with the microscopic properties of the Wulff droplet and of other interfaces, and with the analysis of phase coexistence in the presence of several phases.

The aim is to show that the Euler equations obtained in the quantum case are similar to the classical ones except all physical quantities should be computed quantum mechanically.  The approach will be based on the relative entropy method and certain extension of large deviation theory to the quantum case.  The second part of the project concerns the dynamics of an electron interacting with a lattice structure, modeled by a phonon field.  Therefore, its dynamics is governed by a Schrodinger equation of an electron coupled to a scalar quantum field.  The goal is to prove that the phase space density of the electron converges to a Boltzmann equation in the weak coupling limit.<br/><br/> The underlying dynamics for electrons in a material are governed by quantum mechanics, or more precisely the Schrodinger equations.  Since the Schrodinger equations are difficult to solve no matter analytically or numerically, most models in use nowadays for transport behavior of electrons are semi-classical ones based on classical particles and diffusions.  Although these semi-classical models are valid approximations for large distance behavior, they neglect crucial quantum effects in small scales.  The aim of this project is to study the transport behavior starting from the first principle---the Schrodinger equations.  In particular, the validity of the Euler and Boltzmann equations will be established from the Schrodinger equations.  This is the first step toward understanding the quantum effects in transport behavior.  The long term goal is to understand quantum corrections to these equations. <br/>"

Thus they require probability estimates and limit theorems which are applicable to random sets, or which are dimension free (hence, in essence, infinite dimensional). A major theme in the investigator's previous work, and in much of the current research, addresses both of these issues in a variety of settings. As a first example consider the link between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems, which showed certain probability estimates are equivalent to problems in approximation theory. This link led to the solution of a long standing problem in approximation theory, and portions of the proposed research involve important unsolved analogues of this problem. Another example is the study of the Gibbs conditioning principle of statistical mechanics for statistics with infinitely many components. To begin to handle this type of problem one needs non-logarithmic estimates of large deviation probabilities which are dimension free. These estimates depend critically on dominating points and a suitable representation formula for the probabilities. A variety of conditional limit theorems are to be considered. Additional problems exhibiting these general features are also proposed, and connect with classical geometry, analysis, and statistics.<br/> This work includes further non-logarithmic large deviation probabilities for partial sums of independent random vectors, an investigation of dominating points in a more general setting, and the application of these results to conditional limit theorems for infinite dimensional statistics. Limit sets for random samples of stochastic processes, as well as related coverage problems will be examined, and a primary focus will be to further examine the link between small ball probabilities and non-classical functional laws of the iterated logarithm applicable to occupation measures.

As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. Roughly speaking, one shows that after a suitable scaling, the particle density of a dilute gas (respectively, the boundary surface of a solid) converges to a solution of the Boltzmann equation (respectively, Hamilton-Jacobi equation). Probabilistically, such a convergence is a law of large numbers and its corresponding central limit theorem provides us with some vital information about the microscopic model under the study. <br/> Solids form through growth processes which take place at the surface. Imagine an already formed nucleus to which further material sticks from the ambient atmosphere. The process of the attachment is a function of a huge variety of growth mechanisms depending on the materials involved, their temperature, composition, etc. Following the tradition of statistical mechanics, one studies simplified models which nevertheless captures some of the essential physics. Such simplified models are proved to be useful in understanding the intricate formation of solids. It turns out that these models describe other phenomena such as the spread of infected cells in a tissue, the effect of impurity in the evolution of a fluid, etc. The investigator's research concerns the interplay between the microscopic growth rules and the macroscopic shape of the surface of a solid."

Related difficulties appear in other methods of analysis, such as large deviation approximations. An alternative approach is to allow the routing/service decisions to be control variables. When properly formulated, the analogous approximations to these controlled stochastic networks frequently possess better qualitative properties than their fixed policy counterparts. In addition, many approximate models are simple enough that closed form (or nearly closed form) solutions are possible. The investigator will carry out research on several closely related areas that can take advantage of these features: risk-sensitive control and the control of rare events in queueing networks; robust optimal control of law of large number approximations (also known as fluid models); higher order corrections to the control of fluid models. At the heart of each of these topics is a variational problem for processes with constrained dynamics (calculus of variations or optimal control problems for large deviations and control of fluid models, differential games for the problems of robust control of fluid models or control of rare events). The investigator has recently shown how in certain cases one can convert a variational problem involving constrained and controlled dynamics and a relatively simple cost structure into an equivalent problem involving unconstrained dynamics and a different cost. The latter problem is then solved explicitly. The proposed research includes extending this technique to include problems of buffer overflow in large deviations and constrained differential games.<br/> One of the main concerns of applied probability today is the development of tractable approximations for stochastic networks. Stochastic networks are ubiquitous in modern computer, communication and manufacturing systems, but owing to their complexity and detail are very difficult to analyze. As a consequence, much effort is being put into the development of mathematical models that are faithful enough to ""real life"" that conclusions drawn from them can be used with confidence, and yet which can be solved by either analytical or numerical means. The purpose of this project is to develop such methods of approximation and also the techniques for their solution. A new feature is to allow decisions on routing and service (e.g., which data class should be served in a communication network and where the processed data should be sent) to be control variables that can be optimized. Two particular classes of network problems will be given special attention. The first is the control of rare events. In many networks there are events that do not occur very often, and yet which are nonetheless the main concern. An example is data loss in a communication network. The second class is the robust control of networks, which means the control of a network in which some aspects of the network are poorly modeled or otherwise imperfectly known."

The main objects of interest in this research are the ergodic behavior and the relaxation patterns of several interacting particle systems, including Ising models, contact processes and other lattice spin systems.  Percolation theory is also a major object of concern in this proposal, because of its strong relations to these processes and its simplicity, which makes it a paradigm in the study of probabilistic models with many components.  A substantial part of the proposal refers to the study of the above mentioned processes on arbitrary graphs -- an important current trend in the area.  Several of the proposed problems have their motivation in phenomena observed in nature as, for example, phase transitions, critical behavior, metastable behavior of systems in the vicinity of phase transition regions and domain formation and growth.<br/><br/> On a more informal and broad level one can see the objects of interest in this research in the following fashion.  A system contains a large number of similar components and each component interacts in a simple way with a few other ones, which are near to it in some sense.  For instance one can think of the atoms in a crystal interacting when they are close enough, or individuals in a large population which may suffer or not from some infection with contamination occurring between neighbors.  The local interaction may involve a substantial amount of randomness, but since the system as a whole is large, one expects and indeed observes a much more predictable behavior at the global level. A great deal of interest in such systems stems from the fact that the qualitative behavior of the whole system may depend in non-trivial ways on parameters which are built into the local interactions, but which only affect those in a smooth way (e.g., the rate of infection between neighboring individuals in our second example above).  The general issues of interest are then the understanding of which sort of equilibria can be reached by such types of stochastic dynamics, how an equilibrium state is reached, and how the parameters which affect the local rules may affect the answers to these questions.<br/>"

These are: entanglement, rigidity, random surfaces, and percolation on transitive graphs.  In the areas of entanglement and rigidity, Holroyd's previous work provided the first rigorous mathematical treatment of the subjects, and Holroyd is now pursuing some of the remaining unsolved problems.  For entanglement, Holroyd hopes to answer questions about the sizes of finite entangled graphs, the effect of boundary conditions, and the value of the critical probability.  For rigidity, Holroyd is investigating the effect of boundary conditions, and the continuity of the percolation probability.  Also, Holroyd is investigating the appearance of random surfaces in the so-called plaquette percolation model (which has mathematical connections with entanglement).  Holroyd hopes to answer questions about the values of the critical probabilities for the appearance of infinite surfaces, and about the geometry of such surfaces.  Finally, Holroyd is studying the percolation model on general graphs, such as transitive graphs.  There has been much recent progress in this field, but many fundamental questions remain unanswered.  Holroyd is focusing on proving strict inequalities between critical probabilities for different graphs, and between the critical points for uniqueness and for percolation.<br/> Percolation is a branch of probability theory concerned with the large-scale properties of infinite collections of independent random objects.  The original motivation for the subject was the study of fluid flow in porous materials, but the mathematical models which arise have many other applications, for example in material science, statistical physics, biology and epidemiology.  The models are relatively simple to describe, yet lead to challenging mathematical problems.  Percolation is a well-developed and active area of mathematical research, boasting hundreds of papers and several books, yet several of the most fundamental questions remain unanswered. Holroyd's work focuses on several relatively new extensions of percolation.  Two of these, entanglement and rigidity, have particularly close connections with physical applications in the science of materials, and have been studied previously by physicists. Some of Holroyd's earlier work provided the first mathematical treatment of these two subjects, and Holroyd is now pursuing some of the remaining unsolved problems in these and other areas."

The first problem involves relationships between symmetric exclusion processes and negative correlation inequalities. This would be analogous to the important known connections between positive correlations and spin systems. The second attempts to understand the way in which local changes in the dynamics of the asymmetric exclusion process can have global effects. The third problem is to determine whether (and when) adding a large amount of a symmetric exclusion interaction to an ergodic one dimensional spin system can render the combined process nonergodic. The final one is to study reversible stochastic infection models on random or inhomogeneous trees.<br/> Interacting particle systems is a branch of probability theory that studies random models for situations in which there is a large number of individuals (or particles, cars, molecules, cells, bacteria, messages in a computer network,...) that interact in various ways. Models of this type arise in many different areas of science, as indicated in the parenthetical list above. The exclusion process has been used to model particle motion, computer networks, traffic flow, and issues related to DNA-RNA. Spin systems have been used to model magnetism, spread of infection, and economic systems among others. The main issue in this area of research is to understand how the local evolution rules affect the long time global behavior of the system. This project will contribute to this understanding in a number of ways."

The main goal of this research is, through the study of the main models, to provide mathematically rigorous foundations for their conjectures. Two main objectives are the control of the entire high temperature region for the main models, and a complete description of the low temperature phase of the simplest models.<br/> One of the central themes of probability theory is the emergence of a kind of order out of large number of random events. This is expressed by the main classical theorems, starting with the law of large numbers. These classical result relate to situations where the events are independent, that is do not influence each other. Such an assumption is unrealistic in practice. We investigate the emergence of new types of collective behavior in large collections of random events, where each event can, and will, influence all the others. <br/>"

Working in conjunction with Professor M. Bramson, he hopes to show the existence of ""blocking measures"" for the exclusion processes where the underlying random walk is finite range and possesses non-zero mean.  If successful, they intend to examine the question of characterizing the extremal invariant measures for these processes.  The key tool, the laws of large numbers of Rezakhanlou, will, it is to be hoped, also play a role in establishing convergence results for tandems of complicated Jackson networks.  Professor Mountford will also continue his research with Professor R. Dalang into path properties of the Brownian sheet.  In particular it is hoped to address how many distinct bubbles at a fixed (or a random level) can meet at a point.<br/><br/> Professor Mountford will continue to work in the field of interacting particle systems.  These are random systems consisting of an infinite array of connected values which evolve according to simple rules governed by the current state of neighboring values.  What makes these processes interesting, both mathematically and scientifically, is that often there exist multiple, qualitatively different, equilibria for the same process.  A major task is finding or characterizing all possible equilibria.  Currently Professor Mountford is working on this question for the exclusion process.  This is a process where particles try to move independently in a random fashion.  The (interesting) interacting part of the process comes from the rule that no two particles can occupy the same position and so moves by particles that would result in multiple occupancy are suppressed.<br/>"
