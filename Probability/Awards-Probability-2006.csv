Competing particle systems appear in<br/>various scientific models including biology and theory of<br/>combustion. The PI's will study various aspects of such models,<br/>including hydrodynamic limits, tagged particle behavior and<br/>properties of the associated partial differential equations. Long<br/>term behavior of reflected Brownian motions driven by the same<br/>noise will be examined. Geometric properties of Neumann<br/>eigenfunctions will be investigated. Uniqueness of solutions to<br/>some stochastic differential equations will be proved. Boundary<br/>behavior of harmonic functions and local and global behavior of<br/>heat kernel associated with jump processes will be examined.<br/>Brownian motion on a fractal set will be investigated. Inverse<br/>problem is a mathematical model arising naturally in applied<br/>sciences from geophysics to medicine and physics. The PI's will<br/>study the foundational questions related to this model, such as<br/>existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the corresponding<br/>equations. Other models and processes will be the subject of<br/>separate but related studies; they include Markov processes<br/>conditioned on a small time scale, a change of variable formula<br/>for processes with 4-th order scaling properties and non-local<br/>operators of variable order.<br/><br/>Brownian motion and Markov processes are models for a wide range<br/>of natural phenomena, such as weather and climate, various<br/>functions of living organisms and financial markets. One of the<br/>scientific goals is to make accurate predictions based on<br/>available data. Mathematical methods have to be developed to make<br/>such predictions possible and reliable. The PI's will work on both<br/>theoretical questions leading to general results and on specific<br/>models that can serve as testbeds for the general methods. The<br/>results of theoretical research are often used to make<br/>quantitative predictions in well undrstood models and to make<br/>qualitative predictions related to complex systems. The research<br/>of PI's will be mostly focused on processes that display no or<br/>little long time memory.

First, a new approach for estimating the negative moments of the solutions to linear stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type will be developed. These estimates will allow us to derive the regularity of the probability law of the solution at a finite number of points using the techniques of Malliavin Calculus.  A second objective is to further develop the stochastic calculus with respect to the fractional Brownian motion and related processes using both Malliavin Calculus and path-wise techniques. Our third goal is to establish chaotical central limit theorems for the asymptotic behavior of different types of functionals of a Gaussian process. Examples of these functionals include the self-intersection local time of the fractional Brownian motion, and power variation and related functionals of stochastic integrals.<br/><br/>Stochastic analysis is a modern area in mathematics which aims to study ordinary and partial differential equations perturbed by a random noise.   These equations play a central role as models in many areas in physics and economics.  In order to derive important properties of the solutions, like to compute the probability that the solution takes values in some interval, one needs to apply suitable mathematical techniques like the Ito Calculus and the Malliavin Calculus. We aim to make substantial contributions to the development of these thecniques and their applications to stochastic partial differential equations.  On the other hand, while the classical input noise used has independent increments,  motivated by some applications in hydrology, telecommunications and mathematical finance, there has been a recent interest in input noises  possessing a long memory property like fractional Brownian motion. The development of a stochastic calculus with respect to these long memory processes is also one of the aims of this project."

Focused working groups of<br/>researchers will concentrate on the interface between Markov chains<br/>and phase transitions, on heuristic and rigorous approaches to identifying<br/>and analyzing phase transitions in algorithms.<br/><br/>Discrete Random Systems is a relatively new field that solidified<br/>during an interdisciplinary series of workshops held at the DIMACS<br/>Center and the Institute for Advanced Study ten years ago. Since then<br/>it has matured considerably, and the truly bilateral exchange between<br/>discrete mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists on the one<br/>hand, and probabilists and statistical physicists on the other, has<br/>radically impacted research directions and understanding in all of<br/>these fields.  The field explores algorithms and models that arise in<br/>both the study of physical systems and the mathematical structures<br/>arising from the fields of combinatorics and theoretical computer<br/>science, with an emphasis on analogous behavior such as phase<br/>transitions.  The current project seeks to foster and speed the<br/>development of this interdisciplinary field and to bring to it<br/>coherence as well as rapid scientific development.  The project will<br/>be organized around a series of workshops, tutorials, research working<br/>groups, and a visitor program, all intended to facilitate new<br/>interactions.

Exploration of new areas of application of Discrete Random<br/>Systems will be enhanced by parallel DIMACS programs in Biology,<br/>Epidemiology, the Social Sciences, and Homeland Security. The ideas<br/>developed in this project will have impact on a myriad of fields and<br/>create many new cross-disciplinary connections. A visitor program will<br/>encourage senior and junior researchers, including students, to<br/>participate in collaborative research spawned by the workshops and in<br/>the work of the working groups.

Progress in the understanding of optimal stopping has recently made possible the explicit resolution of a large class of problems.  In this project, it is envisioned that similar advances in significant, and increasingly realistic, questions of adaptive change-point detection -- when one has to learn about unobservable parameters and simultaneously, in real time, to optimize system performance.  In addition, plans include work on a 'fusion' of optimal stopping with stochastic control and filtering theories, and contemplate the exact resolution of combined problems of stochastic optimization with discretionary stopping in the presence of partial observations.  This effort will, for the first time, bring the field to the threshold of solving fairly explicitly several Stochastic Games of combined Control and Stopping, of both zero- and non-zero-sum type.   <br/> <br/>Optimization problems that involve features of both stochastic control and optimal stopping arise in the study of target-tracking models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived sufficiently close to the target, then to decide whether to engage the target or not.  Problems of combined optimal stochastic control/stopping also come up in Mathematical Finance in the context of computing the upper- and lower-hedging prices of American contingent claims under portfolio constraints, in portfolio/consumption problems with an embedded retirement option, in the study of dynamic measures for managing risk, and in stochastic games of the principal/agent type.  The work on adaptive sequential detection of change-points has clear implications for several fields of application (signal processing, finance, wireless communication, manufacturing, image or speech recognition), in contexts where learning about unknown parameters and dynamic system optimization have to be made simultaneously and in real time.  The resolution of the problems suggested in this project is expected to advance our understanding of stochastic optimization and expand the frontiers of its applications. The involvement of graduate students in the research activities is expected to continue at a strong pace, and to be a major factor in the advancement of Applied Probability and of the Mathematics of Finance."

It focuses on models in continuous space and time, with turbulent<br/>or otherwise chaotic behavior, and makes heavy use of infinite-dimensional<br/>random objects, especially stochastic partial differential equations<br/>(SPDEs) which feature white-noise behavior in time and various irregular<br/>spatial behaviors, as well as non-white-noise-based objects which fail to<br/>have the martingale or the Markov properties (e.g. fractional Brownian<br/>noise). Specific topics to be covered, with corresponding physical<br/>applications, are divided in three categories: (i) problems based on SPDEs<br/>and their probabilistic representations, including Feynman-Kac approaches,<br/>ranging from very basic questions of existence and uniqueness for highly<br/>irregular coefficients, to quantitative questions on the asymptotic<br/>behavior of linear multiplicative stochastic heat equations including the<br/>Anderson model and directed polymers measures in Gaussian environments, to<br/>questions of diffusive behavior around random Gibbsian<br/>impurities/obstacles; (ii) specific physically motivated SPDEs:<br/>magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) in a turbulent environment, based on a<br/>Feynman-Kac formulation and its connection to products of random matrices;<br/>a framework for self-organized criticality unifying microscopic and<br/>macroscopic time scales; (iii) extensions of the Russo-Vallois theory of<br/>stochastic integration to general Gaussian and even highly non-Gaussian<br/>processes, with SPDE applications to a genealogical framework for<br/>connecting fractional Brownian motion to Kolmogorov operators.<br/><br/>    The PIs' purpose for studying these topics is to come to a better<br/>understanding of complex random (""stochastic"") phenomena that change<br/>simultaneously in space and time. While many typically think of chaotic<br/>phenomena as being devoid of the possibility of predictable behavior, the<br/>PIs choice of complex models is designed to illustrate how specific<br/>inputs, no matter how random, invariably cause outputs which, while they<br/>may look very random on a short time scale, do show extremely predictable<br/>behavior in other scales of space and time, with important physical<br/>consequences. For instance, the MHD model should be capable of exhibiting<br/>the so-called ""fast dynamo"" effect, by which a magnetic fluid with low<br/>viscosity (the earth's oceans, or its atmosphere, or the sun), when<br/>subjected to a uniformly random energy input, will exhibit a magnetic<br/>intensity which grows at a specific exponentially rate; this effect could<br/>have applications to non-mechanical locomotion. Also of note is the model<br/>for self-organized criticality, which can help understand two-time-phased<br/>systems, such as avalanches: rather than being considered as events which<br/>occurs instantaneously when a threshold is reached, the model will take<br/>advantage of a heat-transfer setting reacting to a random environment in a<br/>short time scale. Many of the project's other models are also based on the<br/>idea that a random environment can have predictable effects, such as<br/>non-diffusive behavior for polymers or particles around random impurities<br/>or force fields. As mathematicians, the PIs are motivated by the beauty of<br/>the continuous-time continuous-space probabilistic tools needed to study<br/>these physical models, and remain true to their commitment to bridging the<br/>gap between theory and applications.

(a) The construction and the<br/>ergodic properties of stationary states for stochastic partial<br/>differential equations arising from a model of a nonlinear<br/>Klein-Gordon equation coupled to one or several heat reservoirs.  (b)<br/>The validity of the fluctuation theorem for entropy production in some<br/>class of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, such as billiards. This<br/>involves the development of large deviations techniques for such<br/>systems. (c) The validity of the fluctuation theorem for the entropy<br/>production in classical and quantum open systems.  (d) The development<br/>of higher-order coarse-graining numerical schemes for Monte-Carlo<br/>methods.  Many fundamental problems in non-equilibrium statistical<br/>mechanics remain poorly understood, both at the conceptual and<br/>mathematical level: for example the characterization of non-equilibrium<br/>stationary states of driven open systems. The fluctuation theorem of<br/>Gallavotti and Cohen is a new universal property of these states and<br/>its study in various systems (deterministic, random and quantum) will<br/>be one of the main theme in the work of the investigator. Multiscale<br/>numerical methods and the general question of extracting the relevant<br/>degrees of freedom out of complex systems is a problem of paramount<br/>importance in modern applied mathematics.  The investigator proposes<br/>to use probabilistic techniques from statistical mechanics (cluster<br/>expansion and renormalization group) to develop efficient numerical<br/>schemes for the coarse-graining of Monte-Carlo methods.  The proposal<br/>of the investigator, besides its theoretical aspects, has a number of<br/>applications to various concrete physical models. These applications<br/>are integrated (via numerical or analytical work) into graduate<br/>research projects.  The project involves several collaborations with<br/>researchers in U.S. institutions and abroad. The project also helps to<br/>the dissemination of modern mathematical tools, in particular<br/>probabilistic ones, into applied sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The field of statistical mechanics is the physical and mathematical<br/>theory which attempts to link the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.<br/>The microscopic world, the world of atoms and molecules, is described<br/>by the laws of Newtonian or Quantum mechanics which involve a huge<br/>number of equations. The macroscopic world on the contrary is usually<br/>described by a few parameters or equations, such as pressure,<br/>temperature, electrical and thermal conductivity, etc... This<br/>reduction comes from the fact that a very large number of particles,<br/>seen from through macroscopic lenses, behave in a very regular<br/>fashion. For example, in a well isolated room, the temperature<br/>throughout the room will be nearly constant. Another example is a<br/>piece of metal heated at one end and cooled at the other end: there<br/>will be a flow of energy from the hot part to the cold part but<br/>(almost) never in the opposite direction. This phenomena are similar,<br/>both in spirit and in mathematical terms to the following: if one <br/>throws an unbiased coin very many times then the proportion of head<br/>will be extremely close to one half and (almost) never exhibit<br/>significant deviations. It turns out that to study this typical<br/>behavior it is very useful to study and characterize the rare events<br/>corresponding to untypical behavior, i.e., ""large deviations"". Having<br/>a detailed understanding of the atypical behavior of a very large<br/>number of particles is in fact the clue to a fundamental understanding<br/>of what is really typical. Theses ideas, which go back to the founding<br/>fathers of physics and probability theory, and their implementations<br/>in various physical situations form the core of the proposal.<br/>"

There are major challenges in these areas that are addressed by a team of researchers, who bring different but complementary skill sets to explore. Statistical Learning is widely recognized as a very active area of interdisciplinary research, which lives between statistics, computer science, and optimization. With state-of-art optimization tools, this research offers a set of new approaches for statistical learning, including new penalties for regularization, further developments of large margin classifiers both theoretically and numerically, as well as nonparametric-based probability calibration for hard margin classifiers. In addition, new visualization and analytical tools for ``High Dimension-Low Sample Size'' (HDLSS) data are developed. Such development is extremely important since HDLSS has become a common feature of data encountered in many divergent fields such as medical imaging and micro-array analysis for gene expression but is outside of the domain of classical statistical multivariate analysis. OODA is a generalization of the recently very productive area of Functional Data Analysis (FDA). In FDA, curves are data points and variation in a family of curves is the focus of analysis. OODA extends this notion to populations where the data points are more complex objects, such as images, shape representations, and even tree-structured objects. The proposed research offers a set of new tools for FDA, including exponential family functional principal components analysis (PCA), robust functional PCA, curve discrimination, and forecasting and dynamic updating of time series of curves. Proposed research will also advance OODA for data on smooth manifolds and tree-structured objects.<br/><br/>The main application area of the research is in health and medicine and civil infrastructure. The research is motivated by and will have beneficial impacts on cancer research, medical imaging, call center management, and network traffic modeling.  However, the developed statistical methods will be useful in fields far beyond those motivating this research, such as demography/epidemiology, financial economics and spatial-temporal modeling.  The team consists of a good mix of well established senior researchers and young junior researchers. Strong mentoring at several levels is an important component of this project. First, there is  strong training of graduate students, in these exciting new research areas, with the goal of giving them the background, and skills needed to start their own research careers. Second, there is strong mentoring of the junior researchers, by the more experienced members of the research team.  In addition to working closely together on research projects, the junior researchers will learn the skills of advising PhD students, through joint supervision together with the more senior members. The team  continues to disseminate the research results quickly and broadly through collaborative work, academic presentations, and journal publications. Web pages are created to enable quick access to user-friendly and accessible software implementations of new methods as well as technical reports and relevant references.<br/>"

Incomplete markets are characterized by there being an infinite number of risk neutral measures, and therefore there is not a unique price, for the typical contingent claim.   Various methods have been proposed over the last 20 years or so to give a reasonable method to choose one risk neutral measure over the others, but they have always been unsatisfying, and ultimately arbitrary.  A current popular approach is to use ""indifference pricing,"" which involves economics arguments when choosing (still arbitrarily)  risk neutral measure.  We propose instead to try to ""complete"" incomplete markets, using a modification of the idea of Heath, Jarrow and Morton, who did an analogous feat for the bond market.  The idea is to use the continuous time pricing of financial derivatives, such as options, which are traded in the markets, and which (by the theory) have to be local martingales.  Therefore we need to show that there exist risk neutral measures that simultaneously make the underlying and its traded derivatives all martingales (or local martingales, or even sigma martingales); this can get quite technical, especially in cases where the maturity of the derivative is before the trading horizon.<br/><br/>In the trading of equities, such as stocks, an element which has become of fundamental importance are financial derivatives, such as options.  An option allows one to transfer risk, such as (for example) portfolio exposure, or foreign currency risk, from one party to another, for a fee.  In this way, it is like fire insurance on a home, where the home owner transfers the financial risk of losing his home to an insurance company willing to bear the risk, for of course, a fee.  However unlike fire insurance or life insurance, it is quite complicated mathematically to calculate a fair price for a financial derivative.  (It is also difficult to price some types of home insurance too, at times, such as storm insurance for homes in Florida and along the Gulf Coast of the US, and insurance companies are increasingly relying on ""re-insurance,"" which can often be modeled in ways analogous to option pricing.)   The models of Black, Scholes, and Merton, for which the latter two were awarded a Nobel prize, explain how to calculate a fair price in simple situations.  We now know how to calculate fair prices in slightly more sophisticated models, known as ""complete markets"", however it is widely believed that the world is more complicated than the complete market case, and is in fact ""incomplete.""  All of the many methods proposed to date to calculate a fair price in incomplete markets have been arbitrary, and in general not accepted either by academics, nor practitioners.  This proposal might go a long way towards solving that problem, by using the market prices of the options themselves, together with the underlying market stock prices, essentially to make an incomplete market into a complete one.<br/>"

Specific topics to be investigated also include jump type noises as stochastic perturbations, integrations by parts formulae with boundary terms for invariant measures, SPDE over unbounded domains, non-linear Kolmogorov equations in infinitely many variables, convergence of their spectral structures and non-linear PDE in infinite dimensions, non-linear infinite dimensional state spaces and their geometry/topology.<br/><br/>Stochastic methods are nowadays standardly used in all Natural Sciences as well as as Economics and Engineering. This project will concentrate on the theory and the applications of a branch of Stochastics, namely Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE), which has undergone an enormous development in recent years. It has become a major research direction in Probability Theory as far as its conceptions and general theory is concerned, and at the same time it is being used more and more in applications in many other disciplines. These include Biology, Chemistry, Physics, in particular Hydrodynamics and Climatology, but also Medical Sciences, Economics, and Engineering. The aims of this project is to contribute to both the mathematical theory of SPDE and to its applications to fundamental problems in the sciences mentioned above."

These include (1) problems related to the hot-spots conjecture of Jeff Rauch for Neumann eigenfunctions and counterparts originally raised by the PI for conditioned Brownian motion and (2) problems related to the sharp spectral gap bounds conjecture for Schrodinger operators.  The problems in (1) and (2) are formulated in terms of survival time probabilities for Brownian motion which are then reduced to the study of finite dimensional distributions functions. The probabilistic formulations are more general than the original conjectures but much more natural from the point of view of the stochastic analysis ideas and techniques suggested in this proposal. The conjectures that motivate these problems are well known and very difficult. Any progress on these problems will likely lead to other applications and will be of considerable interest to researchers working on several different areas of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, geometry and probability. Versions of these problems will also be investigated for processes other than Brownian motion such as symmetric stable processes and more general Levy processes.  <br/><br/>It has been known since the beginning of the last century that many physical and biological phenomena can be modeled by random stochastic processes.  Indeed, the classical model of Brownian motion which is at the heart of the problems discussed above was discovered by the British botanist Robert Brown (even earlier) from physical observations of pollen particles suspended in fluids. More recently, stochastic models have been used in many other settings in the physical, biological and social sciences with many sophisticated applications to economic models, and particularly to financial markets. Many of these applications involve stochastic processes which, unlike Brownian motion, do not have continuous trajectories.  The finite dimensional distribution techniques that arise in the problems above came about because of the connections to these more general stochastic processes. <br/><br/>"

The second topic deals with a generalization of the classical theory of lattice paths on the plane, where now the paths lie on a Riemann surface. The third topic concerns the subject of sign-balance, i.e., the difference between the number of even and number of odd permutations in certain sets of permutations. The primary focus is on a conjecture of Eremenko and Gabrielov that may be connected with recent work on ribbon Schur functions. The fourth topic concerns the saturation conjecture for Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, recently proved by Knutson-Tao and others. There are many new avenues of investigation opened up by recent work in this area. The fifth topic is the theory of k-triangulations, a generalization of ordinary triangulations of a polygon. A recent breakthrough of Jakob Jonsson suggests several new open problems and conjectures. Finally the proposer plans to continue his research on increasing and decreasing subsequences, another subject for which recent work has suggested a host of new directions of research.<br/><br/>The proposal deals with a number of topics in algebraic combinatorics, a field which connects arrangements and patterns (such as jigsaw puzzles, computer chip design, and airplane boarding systems) with sophisticated abstract techniques. This combination of both simple, concrete objects with powerful, abstract reasoning has led to many important breakthroughs and applications. The proposer plans to work in six specific areas in which recent work points to the possibility of much further progress. These areas involve such ideas as using symmetry to simplify complicated objects, extending the notion of paths on a plane surface, decomposing a geometric figure into simpler pieces, and finding patterns in a list of objects. Progress on these very natural questions should have many applications, both within mathematics and to practical problems of scheduling, ranking, optimization, etc.<br/>"

Parisi. These models are simple mathematical objects. It is remarkable that they exhibit such a subtle behavior, and that their rigorous study is so challenging. The PI believes that elucidating these models will bring the discovery of an entire new direction in probability theory. He has been trying for 10 years to build new methods to study them. One of the fundamental objectives (the proof of the Parisi formula giving the free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model) has been attained, but this success cannot hide the fact that overall our understanding remains rather limited. In particular, two central questions, (known as the Ultrametricity conjecture and the Chaos problem) seem as hard as ever. They are possibly related to questions of analysis.  The PI plans to work on these very hard questions, but also will strive to make incremental progress on less daunting issues, in particular the study of new mathematically canonical mean field Hamiltonians that exhibit replica symmetric equations of a new type. <br/><br/><br/>     Mathematics and Physics have influenced each other in fundamental ways since at least Galileo, and this mutual influence is stronger than ever. In the seventies, Physicists discovered that certain alloys (called spin glasses) responded in an unconventional way to magnetic simulation. They introduced new models to explain these behaviors. These models are simple and natural mathematical objects. Yet for a long time there existed no mathematical method to study them.  The early work of the physicists uses heuristic methods that need not be completely reliable. The present project it a step in the long range program of eliminating this discrepancy, by developing new tools from mathematics, and in particular probability theory, to completely understand these fundamental models. The long rang outcome of this program could be a new impetus on probability theory, one of the most important branch of mathematics for applications. <br/>"

There are three main areas:<br/><br/>(i) We want to get a better understanding what happens to the return times for mixing maps near periodic orbits. Currently it is known that generic points have in the limit Poisson distributed return times. However near periodic orbits such regular behavior cannot be assumed and we intend to show that the limiting distribution is a compounded Poisson distribution where the compounded part is Bernoulli and determined by an `escape rate' near the periodic orbit.<br/><br/>(ii) The second area of research is to determine the limiting distribution for return times for non-uniformly hyperbolic systems. This would allow us then to classify the long term statistical behavior for a considerably larger class of dynamical systems including some parabolic systems, `billiard type' systems and also higher dimensional maps similar to the Henon map which has been studied extensively and is technically very difficult to approach.<br/><br/>(iii) The third major area in which we propose to do research is related to a famous theorem by Shannon, McMillan and Breiman that uses the decay rate of dynamical neighbourhoods to describe the entropy. We want to prove a Central Limit Theorem for a $\alpha$-mixing systems. This will considerably extend previous results that used very strong mixing or regularity assumptions to obtain distribution results. We want to use new techniques that should allow us to overcome the difficulties that are entailed by weakening the mixing properties.<br/><br/><br/>Let us note that research in this area is of interest to a wide variety of scientists including experimentalists who want to do numerical simulations. Detailed knowledge about the distribution of return times can be used to develop more reliable ways to numerically analyze time series of chaotic dynamical systems. The proposed research can also serve to develop more efficient data compression algorithms."
