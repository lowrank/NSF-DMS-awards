It has found applications far beyond the realm of physics. To gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of this theory, it is necessary to study simplified models that nevertheless exhibit rich behavior similar to physical systems. This research project will study one class of such simplified discrete models, percolation models. In a separate topic area, probabilistic tools inspired by statistical physics will be applied to differential equations, to analyze the long-time behavior of their solutions.<br/><br/>The project will study the behavior of metrics of physical significance, including the chemical distance and the effective resistance in critical random environments, such as Bernoulli percolation and oriented percolation in low dimensions. These metrics are of central importance for the study of random walks, for instance. Separately, the project will also study the behavior of nonlinear Hamiltonian partial differential and stochastic differential equations with random initial data, especially data chosen from invariant and quasi-invariant measures of Gibbs type. These objects allow for the construction of special solutions with improved long-time behavior compared to the generic case. The principal investigator will participate in the organization of summer schools, as well as the design and teaching of classes on statistical mechanics of both lattice systems like percolation, and continuous dynamical systems like partial differential equations with random data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Answering these questions is based on studying statistically stationary regimes of the system's evolution. This project is targeted at existence/nonexistence of such statistically stationary regimes, their description and behavior for several types of random dynamical systems arising in various applications from traffic to neuronal systems to the large-scale structure of the Universe: (i) randomly forced Hamilton-Jacobi equations;  (ii) small random perturbations of dynamical systems with multiple instabilities;  (iii) systems with random switching.<br/><br/>For general randomly forced Hamilton-Jacobi equations, the PI proposes to obtain a description of the global behavior in terms of one-sided action minimizers and their positive temperature counterparts, thermodynamic one-sided limits for directed polymers. For this, the PI proposes an extension of the notion of the directed polymer from quadratic to general Hamiltonians. Further questions  that the PI will address are: localization/delocalization, characteristic exponents, the renormalization group associated with the flow of monotone transformations defined by global solutions, the fixed points of this renormalization group and simplified discrete models, statistics of shock magnitudes and ages. Small noisy perturbations will mainly be studied for dynamical systems with heteroclinic networks, consisting of multiple unstable equilibria connected to each other by heteroclinic orbits, on much longer time scales than those already studied in the literature. This will allow to make conclusions about the behavior of invariant distributions and approach homogenization questions. For this, the mechanism of unlikely transitions in the network and the associated time scales will be studied in detail. The small scale analysis of the involved random variables will involve Malliavin calculus. For systems with random switchings, the previous work showed that under broad Hörmander-type hypoellipticity conditions, these systems have a unique invariant measure and this measure is absolutely continuous. Obtaining further regularity of the invariant density, studying its smoothness and the character of singularities turned out to be a hard problem. The recent progress by the PI and coauthors provides tools that will be used to approach general hypoelliptic switching systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivated by applications in ecology we will consider processes that take place in two and three dimensional space. We will also study processes that take place on random graphs, which provide models for social networks. We will consider the spread of information and of diseases through these structures. In addition we will study of the behavior of evolutionary games, which were introduced many years ago to help understand animal behavior and have recently been used to understand the interactions of different cell types in cancer modeling. Despite the fact that it has been clearly established that spatial structure changes the outcome of evolutionary games, most applications assume homogeneous mixing and use the replicator equation to determine the dynamics. Having a well developed theory that predicts the behavior of spatial games will be useful for applications. Much of this theory has been developed under the assumption of weak selection, so it is important to understand whether the results are valid when selection is not weak.<br/><br/>Work will be carried out on evolutionary games, variants of the voter model, coalescing random walk, and epidemics. These processes will in most cases take place on static random graphs generated by the configuration model in which vertices are assigned i.i.d. degrees, but in one situation we will let the states of an SIS epidemic and the graph co-evolve. The degree heterogeneity of random graphs forces the development of new techniques in order to extend results known on the d-dimensional lattice.  In addition,  new phenomena occur on these structures, such as rigorously provable discontinuous phase transitions. Specific research goals include (i) Study the rate of decay of the density of coalescing random walks on a random graph. (ii) Disprove physicists? claim that the critical infection probability on a finite graph is 1 over the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. (iii) Show that the critical threshold of the SIS is positive if the degree distribution has an exponential tail. (iv) Study SIR and SIS models on evolving graphs where susceptible individuals cut their ties to infected neighbors and rewire to a randomly chosen individual. In the SIR version we want to determine the critical value. In the SIS case we want to show that when the rewiring rate is fixed and the infection rate is varied there is a discontinuous phase transition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is motivated by fundamental questions that arise naturally in the study and analysis of large datasets; some examples where such questions arise include the detection of community structure in large-scale networks and the reduction of large oversampled datasets to smaller, more manageable collections from which inferences can be made.  Designing, analyzing, and studying algorithms for these tasks often rely on random graph and random matrix theory.  For example, studies have shown that many important networks (such as social networks, biological networks, and power networks) can be modeled by random graphs.  This project will develop theoretical results concerning the eigenvectors of such objects, which will help engineers and scientists implement algorithms and make reliable inferences from large datasets.  <br/><br/>This research project builds in part on the investigator's recent work to obtain a clear picture of the properties and behaviors of eigenvectors of large matrices, including those of a very discrete nature (for example, the adjacency matrix of random graphs).   Some of the topics considered include the study of eigenvectors of Wigner matrices as well as the behavior of eigenvectors for perturbed Wigner matrices.  Such questions are motivated by a diverse collection of applications including community detection, matrix completion, and matrix sparsification.  To address these problems, the investigator will develop and utilize a collection of techniques including analytic techniques (e.g., resolvent techniques, concentration of measure), algebraic tools (e.g., linear algebra), and probabilistic methods (e.g., Littlewood-Offord theory).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the heart of problems in these areas is a need to understand underlying structures in the relevant network, such as geometric structure and community structure. Many networks evolve and grow over time and this leaves a mark on their underlying structure. The broad goal of this project is to understand how the growth of a network interacts with other underlying structures such as community structure. The project focuses on a mathematical understanding of fundamental network models that are common to many applications. Developing such a mathematical theory can lead to fundamental insights that can be applied across multiple disciplines, as well as to connections between disciplines that can lead to further cross-disciplinary explorations. <br/><br/>This project studies a wide range of problems involving probabilistic models of dynamic networks. The project aims to build novel probabilistic theory to analyze and provide insight into such models, as well as to build and analyze novel models that shed light on new phenomena. A main focus is on models of growing networks, which are abundant in the social sciences, economics, and biology. In particular, the project will investigate the influence of the seed graph in growing random graph models. In doing so, the award will develop novel probabilistic tools to obtain quantitative results on the limits of branching processes, which are of independent interest more widely in probability theory and related fields. A second theme of the project will be the study of community detection in growing networks by introducing probabilistic models of growing networks with community structure. This perspective lends itself to relevant new questions, such as detecting communities from networks observed at multiple time points. Finally, the award will also study stochastic processes on networks, resulting in enhanced understanding of how information spreads on networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study will have potential applications beyond the realm of pure mathematics, as random matrices are used in statistics, computer algorithms, and wireless communication. The PI plans to put a special emphasis on the study of sparse matrices as these matrices naturally appear in  signal reconstruction and big data analysis. Another direction of the proposed research is the study of random graphs, which are random networks of nodes connected by roads (edges). Besides representing real transportation networks, graphs can be used to model interaction of atoms in a material, internet communities, etc.<br/><br/>The main direction of this research is the non-asymptotic theory of random matrices, a new and rapidly developing area of research analyzing spectral characteristics of a random matrix of a large but fixed size and striving to obtain bounds valid with high probability.

The results obtained in this direction would have important applications within the random matrix theory in proving limit laws for the spectral characteristics of random matrices. They would be also useful in computer science, as the singular values control the rate of convergence of many numerical algorithms. Another part of the proposed research will address the problems arising in geometry of random graphs This direction is strongly related to random matrix theory as well. The PI will study delocalization and nodal domains of eigenvectors a random graph.

Thanks to several independent recent developments in the topics of optimal transport, partial differential equations, geometric and functional analysis, the interplay of convexity and curvature has further enriched the understanding of several topics in probability and analysis.  While convexity has been developed through the important notion of submodularity in discrete settings, curvature remains elusive. In the past five years, the investigator and various collaborators have introduced discrete notions of the so-called Ricci curvature in Markov chains and graphs and derived several interesting consequences. However, much remains to be understood and developed in terms of convexity and curvature in discrete spaces. Identifying suitable applications in mathematics and computer science first will be an important guiding principle in developing any new theory.<br/> <br/>In discrete probability, the Ahlswede-Daykin Four Functions Theorem has had numerous applications (by way of the FKG inequality and other consequences) and similarly the Prekopa-Leindler inequality has been instrumental in deepening the understanding of the geometric and functional inequalities, while expanding the applications of the (equivalent) Brunn-Minkowski inequality to branches of probability, analysis and PDEs.  A main technical objective of this project is to relate these two seminal results, using optimal transport-based couplings, and derive refined versions of each inequality. Other aspects include deriving higher-order Buser inequalities relating the k-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian to the higher-order (multipartite) Cheeger isoperimetric constant, under additional assumptions on volume growth and/or discrete curvature.

The research will investigate, among other topics, the intermittency and chaotic properties of solutions, which are related to important characteristics of physical systems.  A second objective of the project is to broaden the range of applications of the stochastic calculus of variations, also called Malliavin calculus.  Malliavin calculus is a mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of variations from functions to stochastic processes.

Emphasis will be placed on analysis of random processes with long memory, which are useful for analysis of data coming from finance, telecommunications, and other areas.<br/><br/>This project addresses questions in three topical areas.  The first topic is the study of the stochastic heat equation driven by a Gaussian noise that is white in time and has homogenous spatial covariance.  A challenging goal is to derive a change-of-variable formula for functionals of the solution and investigate applications of this formula to a range of questions, including large-time asymptotics and intermittency properties. It is also planned to further develop the analysis of stochastic partial differential equations driven by rough noises and time-independent noises.  A second topic concerns applications of Malliavin calculus to a variety of open questions, including rates of convergence and asymptotic expansions of densities, when the target distribution is a mixture of Gaussian laws and limit theorems for geometric Gaussian functionals. A third topic addresses questions in the analysis of fractional Brownian motion and related self-similar Gaussian processes, including the dynamics of eigenvalues of matrix-valued fractional Brownian motions and the exponential integrability of self-intersection local times.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These can be used to model how a cancer grows in a particular organ, how a car moves through traffic on a highway, how neurons move through the brain, or how disease spreads through a population. The purpose of this project is to understand important models for growth in random media, both in terms of developing statistical distributions associated with the models, and in terms of understanding in what sort of systems these models are relevant. The project will leverage tools that the PI has been developing from a number of areas of mathematics to solve problems which were previously inaccessible.<br/><br/>Stochastic partial differential equations, random walks in random media, interacting particle systems, six vertex model, and Gibbs states are active areas of study within probability, equilibrium / non-equilibrium statistics physics, combinatorics, analysis and representation theory. This project touches on problems in and draws upon tools from each of these areas. In particular, this project will (1) Develop a new Markov duality based method to prove convergence of microscopic models (including the six vertex model, dynamic ASEP and ASEP with inhomogeneous jump rates) to the KPZ equation, (2) Prove tail and large deviation bounds on the KPZ equation and related processes, and use these for applications like the slow bond problem, (3) Study scaling behavior for random walks in random environments and develop relationships between the FKPP and KPZ equations, as well as study the uniqueness of Gibbsian line ensembles. Through marrying methods from integrable probability and stochastic analysis, the PI will solve problems in both areas which were previously inaccessible from either approach alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving these problems helps to gain knowledge about the nature and structure of complex systems, and to better design and control these systems by making efficient use of scarce resources.  There are numerous parameters in the formulation of each such problem.  In many cases the exact values of some parameters are not available due to the lack of complete information, especially when such parameters describe future events.  An effective way to manage the long-term behaviors of complex systems under such data uncertainty is to introduce probability distributions on the parameters and use expectation functions in the problem formulations.  To numerically solve those problems with expectation functions, certain types of approximations are commonly used.  The investigators study properties of optimization and equilibrium problems defined with expectation functions, relations between these problems and their approximations, and methods to solve them.  Of particular interest is application of these ideas to study the electricity market competition between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.  Results from this project can be used to evaluate the well-posedness of a given problem, measure the reliability of a solution obtained from a numerical procedure, and solve certain types of these problems.<br/><br/>The investigators analyze the structure and properties of optimization and equilibrium problems defined by expectation functions, develop inference procedures and sampling-based optimization methods, and study an application to the electricity market.  Their first goal is to develop an efficient inference method for the solution to the true optimization or equilibrium problem based on a solution to its sample average approximation (SAA) problem.  They expect this method to work for a general framework that allows the SAA functions to be nonsmooth, the SAA solution to be inexact, and the SAA asymptotic distribution to follow a piecewise normal structure as in the cases of general constrained optimization problems.  They apply this method to predict the out-of-sample performance of the SAA solutions.  Their second goal is to revisit existing importance sampling techniques to efficiently incorporate them into an iterative optimization algorithm for minimizing the probability of a rare event under some design parameters, and study properties of the probability function and compare solutions of the original problem with those of its convex substitutes.  The third goal of the investigators is to study a stochastic equilibrium model of the competition behavior between different types of energy generators in the electricity market and to provide a novel generalization of the classical Nash-Cournot equilibrium when the payoff functions are not concave.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They appear extensively in nature and are prevalent in human-generated data such as financial time series, sound files, and internet traffic patterns. By their very nature fractals are rough, non-differentiable objects that cannot be studied by the classical mathematical methods of calculus. The more modern tools of multifractal analysis, which quantify the degree of roughness that appears on various scales, can be used instead. It is particularly interesting to apply multifractal analysis to randomly generated objects, which by default tend to exhibit fractal behavior. Random measures, which for example describe the rainfall distribution over a particular state or the distribution of energy in turbulent fluid flows, are a particularly fruitful area for employing multifractal analysis. The results of such an analysis can often be used for prediction and forecasting of the underlying random system. This research project aims to further develop the mathematical foundations for analysis of multifractal properties.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to analyze the multifractal properties of a broad class of random measures that appear in models of statistical mechanics. The focus will be on random pinning models, random polymer models, random measures arising in two-dimensional conformally invariant systems, and spectral measures of random matrices. In all cases, the major quantity of interest will be the multifractal spectrum, which quantifies the amount of mass the random measure assigns around various points in the space. Computation of the multifractal spectrum is closely related to the theory of large deviations for computing the decay of probabilities of rare events. Many of the tools from that theory will be employed in this project, including the notion of Gibbs condition for describing the most likely behavior of the random system when a rare event occurs. As all the random measures listed above can be described using tools from stochastic analysis, specifically the Wiener chaos decomposition, a particular goal of this project will be to incorporate tools from stochastic analysis into this theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study is expected to lead to a more complete and deeper understanding of these systems, with considerable impact on related areas of science, including mathematical physics, combinatorics, number theory, statistics, and theoretical computer science. The principal investigator will also run a number of seminars and workshops to help postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates in their professional career development, as well as to stimulate interaction across fields including, but not limited to, combinatorics and probability.<br/> <br/>In technical terms, the research project will develop novel methods to characterize inhomogeneous random walks of large returning probability in both discrete and continuous settings for non-abelian groups.  This task also includes finding optimal characterizations of random multilinear forms with large concentration probability. These time-varying models of random walks are highly challenging because of their inhomogenity, but they appear very frequently in a number of probabilistic models; a systematic study of these walks is expected to have substantial impact. With respect to the universality phenomenon, the principal investigator will focus on random polynomials, random eigenfunctions of smooth manifolds, and random matrices. More specifically, the PI will study correlations of roots of random polynomials, nodal statistics of the random wave model with Bernoulli coefficients, and important questions involving the smallest singular values, the spectral repulsion, and the logarithmic determinant and permanent of random matrices of different types of symmetry and sparsity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the exact timing of blowups will be determined, and the existence and uniqueness of a suitable solution will be established beyond the time of the first blowup. In addition, Gaussian approximations for the hitting times in interacting particle systems will be derived using the limiting stochastic partial differential equations.

In the case of plant pathogens, long-distance dispersal phenomena and spatial heterogeneity of infection spreading can lead to failure of disease-control strategies that are based on naive models. Furthermore, such weak control strategies are often uneconomical and use copious amounts of pesticides on crops. In the case of human-contagious diseases, better intervention strategies can be developed if quantitative effects of quarantine are known. By analyzing spatial epidemic models with long-distance dispersal and certain intervention strategies, this research project aims to provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinning of dispersal on features of plant epidemics, and into the effects of quarantine strategies on restraining the spread of contagious infection among humans. To guarantee that the results are relevant to epidemiology, a part of the project will be carried out in collaboration with ecologists and epidemiologists. The involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in this research will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and biology.<br/> <br/>This project addresses challenges in developing more effective and economical intervention strategies for preventing the spread of infection in the plant and human world. Most of the epidemic models that have been analyzed rigorously to investigate the role of space in infection spreading are nearest-neighbor in nature. However, there are many plant diseases where the infection spreads via long-distance dispersals. To understand the effect of long-distance dispersal on infection spreading, several complex agent-based models have been analyzed using simulation and some heuristic methods in the theoretical biology literature. These non-rigorous treatments of the epidemic models sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions.   One of the primary goals of this project is to understand rigorously the effect of long-range interactions on the spread of infections and associated features. In this project, the investigator plans to study several aspects of long-range first-passage percolation models by adding ""long-range interaction"" features to the standard (nearest-neighbor) first-passage percolation models.  The investigator also plans to study intervention strategies for SIS models, which are frequently used for modeling spread of recurring disease among humans, in one dimension and on complex heterogeneous graphs.  The rigorous analyses of these models will require the development of novel mathematical techniques. These techniques are expected to lead to a deeper understanding of a broad class of spatial stochastic epidemic models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complexity is captured by the randomness in the model, both in the environment in which the particles interact or the crystal grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim of the project is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To have a very simple example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of Heads in a large number of tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of getting Heads in one toss. (The mathematical law behind this basic phenomenon is known as the Law of Large Numbers.) Besides its impact on probability theory and mathematics in general, the proposed activity is expected to have a direct impact on the understanding of many physical systems involving random motion in random or disordered media. Understanding complex interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for society.<br/><br/>The proposed activity is on the subject of random motion in random media. Models in this field have been intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers. Their importance arises from rigorous mathematical connections to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, and the KPZ universality class. The PI has already established energy-entropy duality and produced solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions. In particular, the PI proved almost sure existence of Busemann functions for the growth model with general weight distribution.

Most science and engineering problems in part boil down to separating random noise from structure, or sometimes utilizing random noise to amplify structure.  One of the great triumphs of 20th Century science was the development of many robust tools for understanding and analyzing random noise in many kinds of systems.  One such set of tools is stochastic analysis, which presents a rigorous mathematical treatment of ideas that first appeared in physics, adding random noise to the equations of state that describe our world.  These so-called stochastic differential equations have playing a fundamental role in advancing our knowledge in many area: economics, systems engineering, biological dynamics, and within mathematics, with applications to fields like differential geometry and quantum information theory.<br/><br/>This project addresses questions relating stochastic differential equations, heat kernel analysis, and random matrix theory. The central theme is understanding how differential equations with some randomness affect the evolution of eigenvalues of random matrices. These ideas connect with geometry, since the flow of heat on Lie groups (groups of continuous symmetries of geometric objects) can be characterized by such matrix stochastic differential equations.  Herein, ten research projects are proposed which yield connections between these topics and applications to others.  Generally, these problems can be described as studying the large-dimension asymptotic behavior of geometrically-motivated matrix-valued stochastic differential equations.  Of particular note are questions related to the fine (edge) structure of Brownian motion on high dimensional Lie groups from the classical compact families.  The intended research, upon completion, will settle several interesting open questions and present a major contribution both to the theory of stochastic differential equations and random matrix theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The significant interaction between these areas has recently begun with ""applied"" algebraic topology, finding a wide range of applications in sensor networks, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, manifold learning, linguistics, and cosmology. This is due to the fact that many of the data set handled by applied topologists are based on a random sample from a larger population or contain different types of errors. Failure to capture the stochastic nature of topological data can result in a serious misunderstanding of the topology of the system. For example, the layer of extraneous topologies triggered by heavy-tailed errors, as a phenomena analogous to that of audio crackle in temporal signal analysis, will make it very hard to recover an underlying topology of the system. Another example includes topology on non-Euclidean spaces, especially those negatively curved. One good motivation for this study lies in its tree-like structure as a result of negative curvature. By virtue of this structure, the resulting non-Euclidean model can potentially be employed for analyses of various complex networks in physics, computer science, and cosmology. Combining topological concepts with the notion of randomness, this projects aims to properly understand random topology of the system. <br/> <br/>This project addresses research questions on random algebraic topology. Despite its recent development, most of the studies on random algebraic topology do not pay sufficient attentions to how heaviness or lightness of the tail of probability distributions affects the topology. One of the main focuses is on topological crackle - the layered structure of topological elements, typically caused by a heavy-tailed distribution. Although topological crackle has been recognized, at least empirically, in the statistical manifold learning, this project investigates it thoroughly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In light of the involvement of heavy-tailed distributions, extreme value theory (EVT) will be selected as a main tool for this study. Relying on EVT, the PI aims to establish a theoretical foundation for a graphical descriptor of the birth and death of topological cycles, called persistence diagram. One of the main focuses is on the random configuration of points in the persistence diagram by regarding them as a random closed set and discussing their asymptotics in terms of the Fell topology. As the second main topic, the project attempts to investigate random topology on the negatively curved non-Euclidean space. The PI mainly deals with a theoretical question: How do the parameters of the hyperbolic space, including its negative curvature, characterize the random topology? As expected, new phenomena will be uncovered that are never seen in the usual Euclidean setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The phase transition that both the dynamical and static models undergo has received much attention, yet various basic problems have so far been out of reach of rigorous analysis in all three temperature regimes (high/low/critical). The PI proposes to study several such problems, including a power-law for mixing at criticality for the extremal 4-color Potts model in 2D vs. slow mixing in 3D, and establishing the cutoff phenomenon for the FK model off-criticality. A second research direction aims to understand properties of cluster interfaces in these models under various boundary conditions (b.c.): The PI plans to study rigidity and fluctuations of 3D Ising and 2D Potts interfaces under prescribed b.c., towards showing fast mixing for the 3D Ising model with plus b.c. and critical 2D q-state Potts model with free b.c. for all q. The final proposed topic compares the behavior of systems of interacting particles on lattices to other environments. For the SK spin glass model, various features of the static measure are known to be universal in the law of the interactions, and the PI proposes to establish an analogous statement for Langevin dynamics; for branching Brownian motion, the PI will investigate the law of the maximum in the presence of a periodic environment affecting the particles; and for the stochastic Ising model, the PI aims to show an aspect of sensitivity to initial conditions that is special to lattices, contrary to the behavior on typical random regular graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many classical problems of probability theory are devoted to understanding the patterns that are generated by random noise in high-dimensional systems. For example, suppose one has a large matrix each of whose entries is the outcome of an independent fair coin flip, i.e., the matrix is filled with noise. What do the eigenvalues of such a matrix look like? Such questions have beautiful answers that are now well understood. There are however many situations, both in pure and in applied mathematics, in which there is nontrivial structure underneath the noise. For example, in the random matrix problem, we could allow each entry to have an arbitrary variance that reflects the intensity of the corresponding variable. The challenge in such problems, which are much less well understood than their classical counterparts, is to capture the interplay between the structure and the noise. The aim of this project is to develop mathematical techniques that make it possible to address such questions in considerable generality. Beside their fundamental interest, such techniques are expected to be applicable to areas such as statistics and computer science where high-dimensional random structures play an important role. Several education and outreach activities further form a key part of this project.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop new mechanisms and techniques in high-dimensional probability to address problems that could be broadly characterized as having nonhomogeneous structure. The fundamental question in such problems is: how is the underlying geometric structure reflected in the probabilistic behavior of the model? Such questions are of significant importance in various pure and applied mathematical problems. This project aims to systematically investigate such problems that arise in three interrelated themes: (i) the norms of nonhomogeneous random matrices (for example, with arbitrary variance or sparsity pattern); (ii) the geometry of nonhomogeneous random processes (such as those that arise, for example, in random matrix theory or in functional analysis); (iii) geometric inequalities and dimension-free phenomena (for example, in connection with measure concentration or convexity). The project will leverage recent advances on these topics to push forward the state-of-the-art in this area of probability and its applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, random matrix techniques have improved our theoretical understanding of numerical analysis and deep learning networks. <br/><br/>Methods from probability (random walks and coupling), analysis (homogenization) and mathematical physics (loop equations) were recently advanced in connection with spectral analysis of random matrices, to prove eigenvalues and eigenvectors universality. The PI will further develop such tools for the following problems: <br/>(1) Delocalization for band matrices. The PI aims at understanding universality beyond mean field models. One key question concerns band matrices in dimension 1 up to the ``Anderson'' transition. A recent approach to this problem involves a mean field reduction and the connection with quantum unique ergodicity, and it will be developed further; <br/>(2) Universality of extremal statistics.

The first is on random interacting systems of particles, which serve as probabilistic models for phenomena ranging from the spread of infections to the growth of populations of competing organisms. Even the simplest examples of such particle systems are not fully understood. This project is focused on a system in a larger family known as A + B -> 2B models studied by physicists as models for combustion. The system has recently been shown to display surprising behavior on finite and infinite trees, which this project will explore further. The other major question to be pursued is on random trees, another common model throughout the sciences. This project investigates equations arising from random trees whose solutions are related to the existence or nonexistence of certain classifications of trees into categories.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is to study a system of interacting random walks known as the frog model. In this process, inactive particles are placed on a graph. One particle then becomes active and performs a random walk, waking any particles it encounters. These particles then start their own random walks, waking any particles they encounter, and so on. Recent work by the PI has shown that the model exhibits phase transitions between transience and recurrence on infinite trees and between different cover time regimes on finite trees. The project proposes proving the existence of an additional weak recurrence phase on the infinite tree and an intermediate cover time phase on the finite tree. A potential route to this lies in further finer analysis of recursive distributional equations, working first with toy models. The other proposed project explores classifications of trees that follow rules given by automata. The prototypical example is the classification of trees according to whether they contain an infinite binary subtree starting at the root. This classification obeys a recursive rule (namely that a tree is in the class if and only if at least two root child subtrees are) that can be described by a tree automaton. This rule induces a fixed-point equation that one can use to compute the probability of a Galton-Watson tree being in this class. This project will investigate further the relationship between the classifications, the tree automata, and the fixed-point equations. Two approaches to the problem are probabilistic investigation of the random trees and other branching processes arising from them, and the direct analytic investigation of the fixed-point equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been observed that these distinct areas share the common feature that basic probabilistic principles govern the underlying high-dimensional behavior. In most cases, efficient approximation and study is facilitated by (non-asymptotic) high-dimensional probability. The investigator intends to work on several questions related to the most widely applied principle in high-dimensional probability: the concentration of measure phenomenon. This principle is commonly the main reason behind the frequently-observed tendency of high-dimensional systems to congregate around typical forms.  To quantify this phenomenon, one needs precise inequalities for high-dimensional objects (for instance, measures or random vectors), where independence properties can be lacking. The questions under study have a strong geometric component. Results of the study will have implications in disciplines that depend vitally on high-dimensional objects, including asymptotic geometric analysis, geometric probability, machine learning, sparse recovery, random matrices, and random polynomial theory.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is to find the quantities or to isolate characteristics of a function that govern its concentration (say with respect to the Gaussian measure); in particular, to determine the quantities that control small fluctuations (variance) and small ball probabilities. The project undertakes a systematic study of this problem and initiates some new methods to compute deviation inequalities (especially in the small ball regime).  It is planned to test these methods on more general measures such as log-concave probability measures. The project will also investigate limit theorems for geometric quantities that complement concentration inequalities at the asymptotic level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The limiting objects, which are usually characterized by certain symmetries and spatial independence, capture the universal large-scale behavior of many models. In the last few decades, there have been great advances in random planar geometry, especially in the understanding of some fundamental two-dimensional discrete models and their scaling limits. These developments hugely expand our knowledge on the randomness of basic objects such as curves, functions, trees, and surfaces. They also revolutionize the mathematical understanding of some central pieces of physics, including conformal field theory, critical phenomena, and quantum gravity.  This project aims to broaden understanding of the fundamental mathematical underpinnings in this subject.<br/><br/>The project will explore two research directions in random planar geometry. In the first direction, the project aims at linking two ways of constructing random surfaces: (1) through the scaling limits of random planar maps; (2) through a continuous theory called the Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The investigator plans to prove a conjecture asserting that LQG is the scaling limit of random planar maps in a strong sense. As a tool for proving this conjecture, the project considers a statistical mechanical model called the critical percolation and aims to establish that the scaling limit of the critical percolation on the uniform random triangulation and on a regular triangular lattice are the same. The ingredients in both investigations include: (a) combinatorial bijections for planar maps that encode their geometric information; (b) a relation between fractals in quantum and Euclidean geometry called the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov relation; (c) the Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. In the second direction, the investigator aims to resolve questions in the geometry of random planar maps, computational geometry, and fractal geometry. The common theme in the approaches is the application of two recently-developed machineries in continuous random planar geometry called imaginary geometry and mating of trees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This variability can be seen in the shift in the distribution in stock market, in the income distribution, in the electoral map, in the levels of a river or of the waves. All the data arising from these phenomena are considered to be non-stationary. Non-stationary data, as a rule, cannot be easily modeled and studied. The results obtained by many of the existing models may be spurious. They may indicate a relationship between two variables, where one does not exist. In order to apply consistent, reliable results, the rigorous mathematical tools have to be constructed for non-stationary data. This research has double scope. First, it will contribute to a better understanding and modeling of the non-stationarity phenomena and, in addition, will build new, reliable tools for their forecast and their long term behavior.<br/><br/>An important technique for establishing limit theorems for nonstationary sequences and random fields is to approximate them with well understood structures, such as martingales and ortho-martingales. Motivated by the study of asymptotic properties of nonstationary evolutions the theory of nonstationary martingale approximations will be developed. This theory is fundamental for obtaining new projective criteria for nonstationary stochastic processes and for random fields that ensure maximal inequalities and asymptotic results, including the conditional functional central limit theorem and limit theorems started at a point for multi-indexed evolutions.

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

He will also organize conferences and develop courses on this topic.  <br/><br/>Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) arise from extremely important models in areas such as statistical physics, quantum field theory and fluid mechanics. Solving these equations, including proving existence and uniqueness of their solutions, is exceedingly difficult. This is often due to the presence of very singular random forcing, as well as nonlinearities. Various solution theories were established based on different approaches, the most powerful of which is the theory of regularity structures introduced by Hairer around 2013 and further developed by the PI and a few other authors since then. This research will apply the theory, combined with ideas from other areas such as quantum field theory to investigate more SPDE problems. The PI will provide solutions to new important examples of SPDEs, including equations with gauge symmetry and the sine-Gordon equation near criticality. The PI also plans to prove scaling limit results for these singular SPDEs. In particular the PI will study convergence of discrete systems, such as the Glauber dynamics of ferromagnetic systems and directed polymers in random media, to the solutions to these SPDEs in various scaling regimes.
