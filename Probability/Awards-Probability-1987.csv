In recent years, there has been a rebirth of                      interaction with other aspects of mathematical analysis -- such                 as harmonic analysis and operator theory -- and probability                     theory.  In particular, Banach space methods, in the hands of                   highly creative and powerful researchers, have led to fundamental               breakthroughs in these other fields, and in turn probabilistic                  methods have enriched the structure theory of Banach spaces                     themselves.  World centers of excellence in this area are in                    Israel, Paris, Warsaw, Ohio, and Texas. Professor Johnson is one                of the leading figures in the United States and internationally                 in this area, and he heads a strong and productive team of                      researchers at Texas A & M.  Professor Pisier, from Paris, joined               this group last year.  He is one of the truly outstanding                       mathematical analysts in the world with innumerable major results               to his credit, and he is a world class probababilist as well.                   Pisier's work sets major directions for research in Banach space                theory, harmonic analysis, and probability.  The year long                      workshop at Texas A & M, held cooperatively with other strong                   researchers at Texas, brings together singly and collectively the               most significant researchers in the field, all of whom have done                fundamental work, to interact on problems of current concern, and               to interact with young researchers in the field.                                        Professors Johnson and Pisier will continue their deep and              important investigations on a variety of aspects of Banach space                theory; for example, local theory of function spaces, weak                      Hilbert spaces, Lipschitz theory, Banach lattices, probability                  theory, and spaces of operators.  These researchers always obtain               deep and fundamental results, and it is anticipated that this                   project will be no exception."

Limit theorems for sums of                     random variables have been of great interest in probability                     theory for both their mathematical beauty and their enormous                    potential for applications.  Major such application has been the                use of Central Limit Theorem for estimation of the mean.  The                   average of the observed values viz. the sample mean is generally                a good estimator of this.  However, it needs to be ""trimmed""                    occasionally if the data is contaminated by outliers.  The limit                theory of such trimmed sums becomes quite complex, especially if                the trimming is not fixed.  If the normalizing constants are                    determined by the sample as well then the sums are called self                  normalizing.  Self normalizing has great application potential                  since it requires minimum assumptions on the distribution of the                sample."

Stochastic processes serve as models in                  many areas of interest such as weather, economic indices,                       epidemics etc.  The suitability of the models for specific                      questions of interest depends on the sample path properties of                  the models themselves.  The study of these properties uses highly               mathematical tools.                                                                  This research will study three interdependent problems.  The               first will compare sample path properties of stochastic processes               represented as certain Fourier transforms with those of random                  Fourier series with independent infinitely divisible                            coefficients.  The second problem is continuation of the study                  with M. Talagrand of sharp estimates for certain random stable                  tensor products.  The third will continue to study, in                          association with M. Weber, the tail probability distribution of                 Gaussian vectors."

The researcher will continue his                   work on the random fields.  Infinite dimensional probability                    spaces provide excellent models in the study of Eucleadian                      quantum field theory and equilibrium statistical mechanics.  The                probability spaces providing the models have parameters that                    correspond to temperature, momentum cutoff and coupling constants               etc..  Various phenomena such as phase transition, symmetry                     breaking and consequences of renormalization can be predicted by                varying these perameters.  Except in very simple situations, the                proofs of these predictions are difficult to accomplish                         rigorously.  The researcher will try to attack some of these                    intriguing problems via the use of techniques from nonhomogeneous               Gaussian processes associated with the free Markov field."

Considerable progress has been made in recent years towards solving the problem of necessary and sufficient conditions on probability measures and classes of functions for which the corresponding empirical process satisfies the central limit theorem. Some of these advances were made by the investigator himself. He will continue to look for the final solution of the problem. The second problem concerns the law of iterated logarithms for Banach space valued random variables. A set of three conditions is found to be both necessary and sufficient but one of these conditions amounts to proving a weaker version of the original problem. The investigator will attack this reduced problem. The third and smaller part of the research will deal with percolation theory. Among the topics to be considered will be continuity of the percolation probability, bounds on critical exponents and finiteness of the expected size of cluster containing zero."

The first set of problems deal with optimally estimating the effects of treatments and comparing test treatments with a standard treatment. The second problem of robust designs will involve nearest neighbour analysis. The main benefit of the nearest neighbour analysis is to obtain unbiased estimates of treatment effects even when unknown trends are present. This research will construct designs which are efficient under nearest neighbour analysis. ""Clustering"" as an alternative to nearest neighbour methods will be explored also."
