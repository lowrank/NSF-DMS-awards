Mathematical models for physical phenomena are analyzed by studying their scaling limits, that is, their behavior over long timespan and broad spatial scope. The broad arsenal of mathematical tools used to understand these models includes computations of exact formulas for observables, non-linear stochastic and deterministic partial differential equations, and many others. This project aims to study the universality of one-dimensional random growing interfaces, which can model a wide range of physical phenomena, for example the spread of fire and the growth of bacterial colonies or liquid crystals. Recent developments in the field provide new mathematical methods to solve problems that were previously out of reach. <br/><br/>KPZ (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) universality implies that the limiting fluctuations of many mathematical models describing one-dimensional random growing interfaces are essentially the same. Such growing interfaces can be described mathematically in many ways, including free energies of directed random polymers, interacting particle systems, stochastic Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. These models are expected to converge to the same scaling limit, a Markov process called the KPZ fixed point. Such models are typically studied by computing exact formulas for their observables and analyzing the scaling limits of these formulas. This project aims to study exact solutions of interacting particle systems on various domains. In particular, one of the goals of the project is to explain surprising relationships between random and classic integrable systems, such as the Kadomtsev?Petviashvili (KP) and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations and the Toda lattice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It gathers well-established researchers, as well as those new to the field of SPDEs, and aims to provide a stimulating and learning environment for all to share their results and obtain recognition for their work. One of its main goals is to offer sufficient time for the participants to conduct in deep discussions of their results and find possible collaborators.<br/><br/>By adding a term representing the ?noise? and what cannot be controlled in the system, SPDEs offer more realistic versions of the classical, deterministic and well-known equations studied in Physics. This workshop focuses on recent developments regarding the well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of solutions to such equations and discusses some of their applications in queuing theory, finance and population models. There are 24 confirmed speakers and about 15 other participants who have registered or have expressed interest in joining the workshop. The group consists of senior researchers, postdocs and graduate students and aims to provide the setting for all, regardless of rank, to explore topics in the field of SPDEs and find new problems to pursue. With the permission of each speaker, each talk will be recorded and made available online on the workshop?s website for the mathematics community to benefit from.

The SSP is a major research conference series in the fields of probability and statistics, bringing together accomplished and early-career researchers across a range of areas. It has been held at over 20 different institutions over the last 40 years.  The SSP provides mathematicians and statisticians across a range of career stages a unique opportunity to interact, develop new collaborations, and discuss recent advances in their fields. Five invited speakers will deliver plenary lectures and tutorial lectures, including two distinguished plenary lectures, the SSP Founders lecture and the IMS Medallion lecture. There will be poster sessions with brief introductory talks, open problem discussion sessions, and a panel session on career development. This conference provides all participants an opportunity to interact and discuss recent advances in probability theory and stochastic processes and their applications. As such, the conference represents an important networking opportunity for the dozens of early-career researchers in attendance and it will enhance the careers of the next generation of researchers in stochastic processes.<br/><br/>Probability is the mathematical theory that formalizes reasoning with incomplete information, and stochastic processes are probabilistic structures important both within mathematics and for modeling across a range of scientific fields. The scientific committee has chosen invited speakers whose work represents a wide breadth of research areas in probability and stochastic processes, including applications in complex networks, theoretical biology, and statistical physics. Recent research work by other participants will be presented at poster sessions. The open problem sessions provide opportunities for discussions about emerging and challenging topics in probability and stochastic processes and the formation of future collaborations.

The PIMS summer schools in probability theory were launched in 2004, and this will be the 10th school. These summer schools have made an impressive name for themselves and have a proven track record of fostering long-term collaborations between the participants. Past participants have become current academic faculty, able to spread their knowledge further in the research community.<br/><br/>The participants will learn the current techniques in cutting-edge areas of probability.  It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their current research. The expansive scope of the school (4 weeks, about 100 participants) has academic significance: the courses are able to go into much greater detail than courses in shorter summer schools, and participants are much more likely to form new collaborations.

Despite their utility, these models are mathematically challenging, due to issues including high dimensionality and nonlinear interactions. This project will  address these challenges by focusing on the critical role of space in influencing population dynamics, which is pivotal for questions in ecology, evolutionary biology, and virology. The outcomes of this project may provide insights that improve management of ecosystems and treatments for viral infections. The research will also contribute to the development of novel mathematical methods and promote the participation of a diverse group of student researchers.<br/><br/>Our specific focus is on a class of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) where space is modeled as a general metric graph, allowing for a detailed examination of spatial effects on population dynamics. This approach not only addresses the theoretical challenges but also bridges the gap with microscopic particle models. PI will explore several key phenomena, including traveling wavefronts, the asymptotic speed of stochastic waves, and genealogies in expanding populations. By integrating innovative techniques from various branches of mathematics including probability and spectral graph theory, this project aims to significantly advance the understanding of SPDEs on metric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
