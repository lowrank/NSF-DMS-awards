It aims to bring mathematical rigor and come up with new methods related to complex systems in image processing, reinforcement learning, and generative AI. Invoking recent breakthroughs in stochastic analysis as well as developing new tools, the project intends to make progress in the following directions: it introduces new ways to extract meaningful features from images, possibly enhances decision-making systems through reinforcement learning in random environments, and improves the theoretical understanding of generative models such as diffusion-based algorithms. These developments have the potential to contribute to more interpretable, robust, and effective AI systems, with applications ranging from medical imaging to autonomous driving. Beyond technical contributions, the work promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and offers strong mentorship opportunities for students and junior researchers.<br/><br/> <br/>On a technical level, the project explores four main directions: (1) the development of 2D-signatures based on rough paths and Hopf algebra structures to extract robust features from image data; (2) the construction of new image descriptors via expansions inspired by regularity structures and nonlinear PDEs; (3) the formulation of reinforcement learning problems as relaxed control problems driven by rough paths, with entropy regularization and rigorous optimization procedures for the value function; and (4) the study of generative modeling through reversed diffusions and score-based methods, with a focus on improving theoretical guarantees and algorithmic implementations using Malliavin calculus. Each of these threads addresses fundamental challenges in modeling, analysis, and numerical approximation, and together they aim to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theory and practical machine learning tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical models for physical phenomena are analyzed by studying their scaling limits, that is, their behavior over long timespan and broad spatial scope. The broad arsenal of mathematical tools used to understand these models includes computations of exact formulas for observables, non-linear stochastic and deterministic partial differential equations, and many others. This project aims to study the universality of one-dimensional random growing interfaces, which can model a wide range of physical phenomena, for example the spread of fire and the growth of bacterial colonies or liquid crystals. Recent developments in the field provide new mathematical methods to solve problems that were previously out of reach. <br/><br/>KPZ (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) universality implies that the limiting fluctuations of many mathematical models describing one-dimensional random growing interfaces are essentially the same. Such growing interfaces can be described mathematically in many ways, including free energies of directed random polymers, interacting particle systems, stochastic Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. These models are expected to converge to the same scaling limit, a Markov process called the KPZ fixed point. Such models are typically studied by computing exact formulas for their observables and analyzing the scaling limits of these formulas. This project aims to study exact solutions of interacting particle systems on various domains. In particular, one of the goals of the project is to explain surprising relationships between random and classic integrable systems, such as the Kadomtsev?Petviashvili (KP) and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations and the Toda lattice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Timelike Liouville theory is a theory of quantum gravity with a ""wrong sign"" in the exponent, which makes it impossible to put it in the setting of ordinary probability theory. This project will aim to develop an extension of probability theory that accommodates Gaussian distributions with negative variance, and apply this extension to construct rigorous timelike Liouville theory. This project involves graduate students.<br/><br/>While spacelike Liouville theory has received intense attention in the probability community over the last two decades, the timelike theory - which is closer to a true theory of quantum gravity - has remained beyond the reach of rigorous mathematics. The main reason, as in quantization efforts for other theories of gravity, is the appearance of Gaussian integrals with the ""wrong sign"" in front of the quadratic term. If the quadratic term comes with a positive sign, ordinary measure theory does not give the tools to make sense of it in a way that is consistent with physical calculations. This project will provide a rigorous framework for doing that, which has been outlined in near-complete detail in the project description. The long-term goal of this effort would be to derive the timelike DOZZ formula in the new rigorous setting, which has eluded mathematical understanding until now.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Free probability began as a subfield of the theory of von Neumann algebras, which in turn originated in a series of papers by Murray and von Neumann in the 1930s, as part of an effort to provide mathematical foundations for quantum mechanics.  A key concept in free probability is the notion of free independence, which generalizes the classical notion of independence of random variables, enabling the development of a robust ?noncommutative probability theory? in the setting of von Neumann algebras, where rich mathematical structure emerges from the interactions of objects known as free random variables (owing in part to the fact that their multiplication, like that of matrices of complex numbers, is not commutative).  Methods from free probability are now a cornerstone of the structure theory of certain von Neumann algebras, and have applications to a variety of other fields, including random matrix theory and quantum information theory.  In this project, the PI will study several important open problems on probability distributions of free random variables and explore their applications to random matrix models.  The project integrates research with education and will provide research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, complemented by outreach initiatives to teach and mentor middle school and high school students, with a particular emphasis on supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds.  <br/> <br/>The Brown measure of a free random variable is analogous to the eigenvalue counting measure of a square matrix. It is an extension of spectral measures of normal operators to non-normal operators. This measure encodes a great deal of information and can predict the limiting distributions of non-Hermitian random matrix models. In this project, the PI seeks to develop analytic techniques for computing the Brown measures of a diverse range of free random variables, motivated by operator algebras, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The boundary values of certain operator-valued subordination functions will be explored using tools in complex analysis, operator algebras, and noncommutative analysis. The project will investigate random variables formed through addition, multiplication, or polynomials of free random variables. The new Brown measure results will then be used to analyze limiting laws and the convergence of non-Hermitian random matrix models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another important family of examples includes card shuffle sequences, which have intriguing connections to DNA rearrangements in biology. The main targets of study in this project are mixing times, cutoff, and limit profiles. The time it takes a physical system to reach equilibrium is an example of a mixing time. The cutoff phenomenon describes a phase transition during which the distance of a Markov chain from equilibrium very abruptly drops to near zero. The limit profile captures the limiting value of the distance to stationarity as the size of the state space grows to infinity.

This research not only advances our knowledge of mathematics but also contributes to solving real problems that affect people?s lives. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the mathematical study of random motion in random environments, with particular emphasis on models of random growth. The principal investigator has developed and applied a key analytical tool--Busemann functions--to a broad class of stochastic models, including directed and undirected percolation, random polymers, and random walks in random environments, across discrete, semi-discrete, and continuous frameworks. Notably, this includes work on the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, a central object in the study of stochastic growth. Busemann functions provide deep structural insights: they solve energy-entropy variational formulas, describe infinite-volume Gibbs measures in positive temperature regimes, and characterize geodesic rays in zero-temperature settings. They also yield eternal solutions and stationary distributions in associated random dynamical systems (RDS), playing a central role in understanding their stability properties and in identifying shock locations in inviscid or zero-temperature models. This project aims to extend this framework to a wider class of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equations--both viscous and inviscid, with time-dependent or time-independent Hamiltonians--and to resolve several open problems that emerged from prior work. Chief among these is a longstanding question in the theory of lattice percolation: the differentiability of the shape function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They often have simple descriptions; for example, a randomly chosen tiling of the chessboard with domino tiles is one of them. Yet, as the domain that is being tiled becomes large, such systems exhibit intricate behavior and serve as mathematical models for phase transitions seen in nature. More concretely, the experimentally observed phenomenon of roughening of crystals at temperatures close to absolute zero has similar phenomenology. Mathematical analysis of dimer models is challenging, and it requires a diverse set of sophisticated tools from different branches of mathematics including algebra, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. For a broad range of planar domains, these tools will ultimately make it possible to analyze the large scale behavior at a very fine resolution, offering key insights into a much wider range of probabilistic and physical systems. <br/><br/>The proposal is dedicated to dimer models on growing planar graphs with periodically varying edge weights. The overarching goal is to describe limit shapes and bulk/edge/global fluctuations around them for a broad class of domains as the size of the domain grows. Establishing an explicit correspondence between periodic dimer models and Yang-Baxter solvable Solid-On-Solid models of statistical physics is essential, and this bridge will provide access to new algebraic structures that in turn will yield asymptotic results. Another key connection is to the theory of Riemann surfaces, whose geometry is essential to describing the limiting behavior of the models. The zero-temperature limit will also be analyzed, and it will be described in terms of tropical geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to discover general mathematical laws that govern such systems, which appear quite different at small scales and at large scales. It is important to understand how different kinds of small-scale evolution lead to different large-scale systemwide behaviors. Real-world phenomena modeled by these mathematical systems include the motion of vehicles in traffic, data packets in communication networks, fluid particles in a tube, fluid spreading in a porous medium, epidemics advancing in a population, and the fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that these mathematical models capture essential features of physical reality.

Other goals of this project include descriptions of the environment around an optimizing path in terms of functions that can be computed from the environment, the joint probability distributions of geodesic trees and competition interfaces, and the regularity properties of large scale limit shapes.

Such membranes arise naturally when classical models, such as the Ising or XY models, are either assigned random inhomogeneous interactions or are placed in a random magnetic field. They have also recently been discussed in the study of random quantum circuits. The research aims to explore the emergent physical phenomena from a mathematically rigorous standpoint.

Another instance of this phenomenon is first-passage percolation, where the metric structure of the space is altered by random local perturbations. This project will study fundamental problems in these areas with rigorous mathematical tools. The problems are centered on minimal surfaces in random environments, which are models for both the interfaces between different spins in random-bond and random-field Ising models, for the spins of the random-field XY model, and for geodesics in first-passage percolation.
