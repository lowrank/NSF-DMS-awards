The PIMS summer schools in probability theory were launched in 2004, and this will be the 10th school. These summer schools have made an impressive name for themselves and have a proven track record of fostering long-term collaborations between the participants. Past participants have become current academic faculty, able to spread their knowledge further in the research community.<br/><br/>The participants will learn the current techniques in cutting-edge areas of probability.  It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their current research. The expansive scope of the school (4 weeks, about 100 participants) has academic significance: the courses are able to go into much greater detail than courses in shorter summer schools, and participants are much more likely to form new collaborations.

The SSP is a major research conference series in the fields of probability and statistics, bringing together accomplished and early-career researchers across a range of areas. It has been held at over 20 different institutions over the last 40 years.  The SSP provides mathematicians and statisticians across a range of career stages a unique opportunity to interact, develop new collaborations, and discuss recent advances in their fields. Five invited speakers will deliver plenary lectures and tutorial lectures, including two distinguished plenary lectures, the SSP Founders lecture and the IMS Medallion lecture. There will be poster sessions with brief introductory talks, open problem discussion sessions, and a panel session on career development. This conference provides all participants an opportunity to interact and discuss recent advances in probability theory and stochastic processes and their applications. As such, the conference represents an important networking opportunity for the dozens of early-career researchers in attendance and it will enhance the careers of the next generation of researchers in stochastic processes.<br/><br/>Probability is the mathematical theory that formalizes reasoning with incomplete information, and stochastic processes are probabilistic structures important both within mathematics and for modeling across a range of scientific fields. The scientific committee has chosen invited speakers whose work represents a wide breadth of research areas in probability and stochastic processes, including applications in complex networks, theoretical biology, and statistical physics. Recent research work by other participants will be presented at poster sessions. The open problem sessions provide opportunities for discussions about emerging and challenging topics in probability and stochastic processes and the formation of future collaborations. Further information on the SSP can be found on the conference website: https://ssp.stat.indiana.edu.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their utility, these models are mathematically challenging, due to issues including high dimensionality and nonlinear interactions. This project will  address these challenges by focusing on the critical role of space in influencing population dynamics, which is pivotal for questions in ecology, evolutionary biology, and virology. The outcomes of this project may provide insights that improve management of ecosystems and treatments for viral infections. The research will also contribute to the development of novel mathematical methods and promote the participation of a diverse group of student researchers.<br/><br/>Our specific focus is on a class of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) where space is modeled as a general metric graph, allowing for a detailed examination of spatial effects on population dynamics. This approach not only addresses the theoretical challenges but also bridges the gap with microscopic particle models. PI will explore several key phenomena, including traveling wavefronts, the asymptotic speed of stochastic waves, and genealogies in expanding populations. By integrating innovative techniques from various branches of mathematics including probability and spectral graph theory, this project aims to significantly advance the understanding of SPDEs on metric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
