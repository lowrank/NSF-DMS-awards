It involves research on space-time inhomogeneous contact processes and branching random walks.  It also involves a study of quasi-stationary distribution which is an essential concept related to equilibrium properties of a process conditioned to stay inside a sub-state-space. In an earlier work, we established a relation between quasi-stationary distributions and a Fleming-Viot particle system, which promises a novel, constructive and useful approach to quasi-stationarity. The proposed research on the subject will build on and significantly extend this work.<br/> <br/>  Many natural and social phenomena arise as a result of interaction of large number of components (particles, humans, viruses, plants,...). Due to immense complexity of these systems, in order to make them more accessible, one assigns random components to these interactions and studies corresponding stochastic models. As suitable models for various physical systems, interacting stochastic systems have been studied extensively over the last decades. They were found also to be very useful models in epidemiology.  The proposed project is related to infinite stochastic systems whose evolution is spatially constrained. <br/>Some mathematical questions to be addressed can be translated as:<br/>What happens with an infection if it spreads using only a certain number of individuals and contacts among them? How does reduction of a habitat affect distributions of a plant species? <br/>Beside its mathematical significance, the proposed research has very important applications in biogeography and evolution theory and hopefully it will generate fruitful collaborative interdisciplinary research."

The first one involves study of spectral and eigenvectors properties of sparse random graphs. This is a joint work with Ioana Dumitriu. Eigenvectors of graph adjacency or laplacian matrices have natural significance as solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. However, very little theoretical results are known about eigenvectors of random graphs. Our ongoing investigation combines methods and intuition from the Random Matrix Theory with graph combinatorics. We have so far succeeded in obtaining interesting results for random regular graphs where we show that, when the degree grows poly-logarithmically with the order, the adjacency matrix displays some of the properties of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles. Eventually we plan to  study ``real world'' graphs, particularly the ones with a given degree distribution. The second direction is the construction and study of a diffusion on the space of continuum trees whose reversible measure is the Brownian CRT, as conjectured by David Aldous. This appears as a limit of natural discrete Markov chains on finite phylogenetic trees. Continuum trees are of great significance as they appear as the limiting state space of several families of random trees and random planar maps (via Schaeffer bijection). It appears from our ongoing study that this limiting diffusion is a new kind of measure-valued process on the space of such trees, reminiscent of the classical Fleming-Viot model. The proposed method is a continuation of ideas developed by the PI in related recent work.<br/><br/><br/>Random graphs and networks are popular in diverse areas such as social networks, models for the internet, computer vision, and number theory. Several natural optimization problems on graphs (e.g., figuring out clusters, or ranking algorithms such as Google PageRank) involve what are called eigenvectors of the graph. If the network grows randomly, its eigenvectors are random, and it is of interest to study its properties. A study of such properties is listed as one of our main research areas. The other main area involves the structure of phylogenetic (or evolutionary) trees. A lot of recent interest in Biology and related mathematics is in the structure of the collection of all possible evolutionary trees. This is an enormous space very different from the usual Euclidean (say, three dimension) space. One way to explore this set is to let a Markov chain jump around from tree to tree randomly in a ``nice'' way. A few such models have been proposed in the literature. We take up the study of one of them which is related to other areas of Probability. The analysis and results are expected to be quite novel in the subject area."

In the area of stochastic flows, the PI will continue efforts on the distribution of passive tracers under the motion of stochastic flows. Here, the goal will be to investigate the joint asymptotic distribution of two disjoint bodies of passive tracers moving under the flow. This will also be investigated for the case of turbulence where the tracers are carried by Kolmogorov velocity fields. Other research will be carried out involving the behavior of the singular flows called Kraichnan flows. In the area roughly labeled the parabolic Anderson model, the PI will investigate the so-called dynamo problem. This involves a model for the generation of magnetic fields in turbulent media such as on the surface of a star. The dynamo conjecture is that the magnetic field of a star will exhibit exponential growth. The PI will attempt to establish this exponential growth and examine the asymptotics of the exponential constant as the inverse Reynolds number goes to zero.<br/><br/>The general spirit of this proposal is to pursue a mathematical investigation of<br/>physical phenomena in the presence of random and chaotic media. Examples of this<br/>in the investigations in stochastic flows are provided by the distribution of plankton particles when carried by ocean currents or the spread of oil as in the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The goal of this study is to give information on the distribution and shape of a body of particles being carried by a random current. Another example of phenomena in chaotic media is the creation of magnetic fields in young stars. The field strength is conjectured to exhibit rapid growth and the mathematical model should also have the high focusing of the magnetic field strength in small regions which are sun spots. This will lead to more understanding of the development of these spots which have an effect on events on earth. Another project relates to behavior of polymer chains. One aspect of this work will be to make a detailed study of the phase transitions of polymers and the effect the relation of length to temperature has on the nature of the transition. Another aspect of the polymer study is to gauge the effect that a random environment has on the shape of a polymer. So far, very noisy environments have been shown to force the polymer into a particular shape, that is intense randomness reduces the degrees of freedom of the polymer in the model. We aim to gain more insight into the nature of this particular shape."

In many cases the large-scale behavior of such ""quasirandom"" systems reproduces interesting aspects of the large-scale behavior of the random systems they mimic.  At the same time, quasirandom systems exhibit many rich and complex patterns specific to the deterministic context, and these patterns demand explanation.<br/><br/>One reason for studying quasirandom systems is that they may have applications to Monte Carlo simulation: it could be that for many random systems of interest to scientists, the best way to get statistical information about the system is to replace it by a quasirandom analogue.  But in the longer run the real significance of the PI's work may be the way it shows that many of the theorems of probability theory remain true when they are recast as statements about discrepancy, with no mention of probability at all.  Such a radical revision of probability theory seems necessary if we are ever to understand how non-random mathematical objects (like the digits of pi) behave ""as if they were random""."

A random matrix is used  to model a typical behavior in many problems arising in high-dimensional convexity, functional analysis, as well as in physics and computer science. In all these areas the size of a matrix, i.e. the available number of degrees of freedom is very large, but fixed. This project aims to investigate the spectral phenomena which arise with high probability, and obtain explicit probability bounds. One of the central questions here is evaluation of the probability that a large random matrix is non-singular, and obtaining quantitative characteristics of non-singularity. To this end, the project brings into play a wide array of tools, ranging from classical probability, to asymptotic geometric analysis, and additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is currently undergoing a period of rapid development. In a large part this is due to the demand for explicit probabilistic estimates arising in various problems of computer science and engineering. This includes, among others, the wireless communication, where random matrices are used to model interactions between antennas and obstacles on the ground. The study of random matrices is also of importance for internet privacy protection, since certain kinds of random matrices became tools of choice in constructing hacking algorithms. The project will develop explicit quantitative spectral bounds, which are required for the aforementioned problems.<br/>"

On the technical level, the focus is on the study of properties of (generally high-dimensional) convex bodies, random matrices, Gaussian measures and processes, and of approximation problems. Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory. A combined, focused effort is expected to bring new insights toward a better understanding of the participants' respective fields of research, which - while related and occasionally overlapping - are not identical and often employ different perspectives.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics encompassing the methods and the problems described above has recently entered a period of rapid growth. In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

In such systems, members under consideration are traditionally located on the vertices of a static graph, with the state of each  member being updated according to transition rates that depend upon the configuration in its local neighborhood. Motivated by a variety of problems that arise from ecology, sociology and neuroscience, the primary objective of this research project is to introduce and analyze simple stochastic models that extend the framework of interacting particle systems as the components under consideration evolve either on hypergraphs or on dynamic graphs rather than traditional static graphs. Hypergraph structures will be employed to model systems including an intermediate mesoscopic scale: contact process with destruction of cubes and hyperplanes as a model of populations subject to catastrophic events, and voter type model on hypergraphs as a model of the majority rule in explicit space. This results in systems in which all the vertices connected by the same hyperedge are simultaneously updated, either spontaneously or at a rate that depends upon the global configuration of the hyperedge. Dynamic graph structures will be employed to model systems of components that have the ability to shape their spatial environment:<br/>coupling of contact processes with varying parameters as a model of host-symbiont interactions, and random walks on weighted graphs as a model of electrochemical signals in the brain. This results in systems involving dynamics on the graph similar to that of traditional interacting particle systems, but also dynamics of the graph, with a feedback between dynamics on and of the graph. Beyond the mathematical analysis of some specific models, the aim of this research program is also to initiate the development of a theoretical framework, inspired from interacting particle systems, in order to model more realistically systems that are ubiquitous in nature.<br/><br/>In the early seventies, Frank Spitzer in the United States and Roland Dobrushin in Soviet Union independently introduced a new theoretical framework, known as interacting particle systems, in order to understand the dynamics of systems that are spatial by nature. This framework not only had a major impact in a wide variety of fields such as physics, biology and sociology, but it also gave rise to a number of challenging and exciting mathematical problems. The main objective of research in this area is to understand the macroscopic behavior and the spatial patterns that emerge from the microscopic interactions that dictate the local dynamics of large systems of components such as atoms, cells, plants of different species or individuals with different opinions. Motivated by a variety of problems that arise from ecology, sociology and neuroscience, the primary objective of this research program is to extend, starting from simple examples, the traditional framework of interacting particle systems following two directions. The first extension consists of systems that include an intermediate mesoscopic scale: populations that undergo catastrophic events modeled by the removal of all the individuals in large blocks, and opinion dynamics including the emergence of large discussion groups.<br/>The second extension, also known as adaptive networks in the physics literature, consists of systems of components that have the ability to shape their spatial environment: host-pathogen and host-mutualist systems in which symbionts affect the mortality of their host, and electrochemical signals that can strengthen or weaken the connections between neurons.<br/>This research project is also the first step towards the development of more realistic models of biological and sociological systems that cannot be captured by traditional interacting particle systems."

Such models appear naturally in both mathematics and physics, for example when one considers ideal crystal melting, or molecular condensation on a substrate, or traffic evolution. Accurate analysis at large times is typically very difficult, and we concentrate on models with additional algebraic structure that originates in seemingly unrelated parts of mathematics. This structure helps to discover new phenomena that tend to be universal, i.e. present in a much wider range of models. As a result, using sophisticated mathematical tools, we find new universal laws that play the role of the famous bell-shaped curve, and that can often be observed later through physical and numerical experiments."

This project will use the equilibrium approach to further our grasp of so-called incomplete markets, i.e., the markets which--just like the real-world markets--have a limited ability to mitigate risk. <br/><br/>The investigator will study a number of questions centered around the notion of a stochastic equilibrium in incomplete continuous-time financial markets. The goals of the proposed research are two-fold. On the conceptual level, it aims to provide a general methodology for the specification of continuous-time asset-price models from the market primitives and to establish a new modelling framework for the analysis and better understanding of incomplete financial markets and their equilibrium dynamics. A novel concept of completeness constraint is introduced in order to capture the fruitful idea that market incompleteness can be interpreted as an exogenously-imposed constraint.  On the technical level, it furnishes tools for the mathematical analysis of the framework described above, based on the existing and new stochastic-, convex- and functional-analytic and PDE-based methods. These tools are, then, used to establish the existence of equilibria and to study their properties.  The mathematical core is the study of the notion of stability for the optimal solutions of stochastic control problems as functions of the modelling inputs. The obtained stability results can be interpreted in terms of the aggregate demand functions and used to grant existence of equilibrium markets with the help of the appropriate (classical and new) fixed-point theorems."

Accurate analysis at large times is typically very difficult, and we concentrate on models with additional algebraic structure that originates in seemingly unrelated parts of mathematics. This structure helps to discover new phenomena that tend to be universal, i.e. present in a much wider range of models. As a result, using sophisticated mathematical tools, we find new universal laws that play the role of the famous bell-shaped curve, and that can often be observed later through physical and numerical experiments."

Three of the proposed questions in the first topic concern ""When can species coexist"", while a fourth concerns the possibility that the quadratic contact process in two dimensions can have two phase transitions one for the existence of stationary distributions and a larger one for survival from a finite set. In the second topic one interesting mathematical problem concerns ""explosive percolation"" conjectured to have a discontinuous transition, while the more biologically important question concerns how the outcomes of epidemics and ecological competitions change when they take place on random graphs, which arguably provide better models of the real social networks. The third topic concern situations in which the characteristics of individuals in ecological competitions are also not static but evolve in response to their environment. My first steps in the area ""adaptive dynamics"" were taken in a study of predator-prey systems with John Mayberry. Here, we propose to study more complex examples that lead to evolutionary cycling and a second problem on the evolution of virulence, which leads to consideration of the role of spatial structure in increasing the virulence of diseases.<br/><br/>Many interesting mathematical questions arise from biology. Here we address some questions that arise from ecology and evolution. Three examples should illustrate the nature of our work. (1) At the turn of the century, observations of social networks revealed that we live in a small world in which everyone on the planet is separated by six degrees of separation. Now we need to understand how this geometry of social networks effects the spread of epidemics and the other biological and social processes. (2) The world shows much more biodiversity than mathematical models predict, so it is important to understand the mechanisms which allow for species coexistence. More generally, we will also be interested in how spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological competition. (3) In most situations the characteristics of individuals involved in competition with other species or with infectious agents are not static but evolve in time. <br/>For example, in most cases diseases evolve to be less virulent, but in a spatially structured population the opposite may occur. Co-evolution of hosts and parasites can lead to interesting evolutionary cycling, sometimes called ?Red Queen Dynamics after the character in Alice in Wonderland who has to keep running to stay in the same place."

Mainly this will be achieved by probabilistic thinking about questions that arise in other areas.  In group theory, the PI will work on the question of whether every group is sofic.  The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it. In graph theory, probabilistic thinking leads to new questions and results involving inequalities for finite graphs.  Namely, one often finds when counting combinatorial objects that a subgraph contains fewer of them than the whole graph. But if the subgraph is based on fewer vertices, then one ought to normalize the counts to reflect this.  The PI has some partial results in this direction and proposes to find more.  In ergodic theory, questions involve graphings, colorings, and factors. In fact, it may be that these investigations will lead to progress in the theory of percolation on groups.  Combining several of these areas are very natural processes that are related (by previous work of the PI) to algebraic invariants known as ell-2-Betti numbers.  Therefore, they suggest ways of resolving an important open question about these Betti numbers.<br/><br/><br/>In the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs (networks) to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.  It is always desirable to have finite approximations to infinite objects, and the same holds for infinite groups.<br/>Gromov and Weiss suggested a way to use finite networks for this purpose.<br/>If one can actually succeed in making such approximations for all groups, then this would resolve a host of important conjectures in a variety of fields of mathematics.  The PI proposes to continue work on this question.<br/>Inequalities are important in most areas of mathematics. The field of graph theory and combinatorics contains many inequalities, often of the form that certain graphs contain the most (or the fewest) possible objects of a certain type among all graphs in a given class. The PI will develop novel inequalities of this type, which are inspired by a probabilistic viewpoint.<br/>Topology is the study of the shape of things. One tool is to count the number of holes of various dimensions. But if the whole space of interest is infinite, then the number of holes is often either zero or infinity. It turns out that there is a more informative way to count holes, and previous work of the PI has shown how it is related to random combinatorial objects.<br/>Therefore, the PI will attempt to use his new random objects to resolve an important open question about this hole counting."

The decision maker aims to minimize the long time average cost by the choice of a strategy that is adapted to the filtration generated by the observations only.  The goal of the project is to characterize the fundamental properties of optimal decisions, such as pathwise optimality and ergodic theorems, and to investigate certain sub-optimal decision algorithms which can be efficiently implemented in practice.  The research will build on and extend recent advances in the ergodic theory of nonlinear filters.<br/><br/>Partially observed stochastic systems are ubiquitous in a wide range of disciplines including signal processing, communications, navigation and tracking, robotics, data assimilation and forecasting, bioinformatics, physics, economics and finance.  In such problems, one is faced with two major difficulties: uncertainty in the dynamics of the system of interest, and the limited availability of information.  This project aims to understand how one can best make decisions in an uncertain environment when only partial information is available.  The development of a mathematical theory characterizing the properties of optimal decisions can help elucidate the fundamental limitations one faces in making decisions with limited information, as well as lead to practical algorithms for making near-optimal decisions which can be used in applications."

The stochastic evolution of molecular sequences on such a phylogeny is an instance of a Markov model on a tree. In this project, the PI will further develop connections between the theory of Gibbs measures on trees and the phylogenetic reconstruction problem.

In recent years, probability theory, the mathematical study of randomness, has provided key new insights in assessing the power of statistical methods to reconstruct evolutionary processes in large-scale phylogenetics. The main theme of this project is to further investigate these connections. In particular, more realistic models of evolution will be considered.

Brownian control problems(BCP) have been proposed  as formal diffusion approximations for a broad range of controlled networks.Currently there is a critical lack of general theory that establishes rigorous connections between a network control problem and its associated BCP. The first goal of this research is to establish that for a wide range of control forms, network structures and optimization criteria, the value functions of suitably scaled controlled network models converge to that of the corresponding diffusion control problem. The second goal  is the study of qualitative properties of diffusion control problems arising from the above asymptotic analysis.  These problems correspond to a family of singular control problems with state constraints in non-smooth domains. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations for such control problems are a challenging class of degenerate elliptic nonlinear partial differential equations with gradient constraints and somewhat non-standard boundary conditions. Existence, uniqueness and regularity theory for HJB equations for a range of such control problems and cost criteria will be developed. Wellposedness of such equations is a central ingredient in development of numerical schemes for obtaining near optimal controls.  Additionally, regularity is key in reading off useful qualitative information on the form of an optimal control.  An example of such  information is the characterization of an optimally controlled process as a reflected diffusion over a domain determined in terms of a suitable free boundary problem. Such characterization results for singular control problems are some of the most elegant and useful results in the field and their study for problems with state constraints will be a focus of this research.<br/><br/>Dynamic control problems that motivate this work arise from a wide range of application areas, such as, telecommunications, manufacturing, service engineering, computing, etc.  Control in such networks can take a variety of forms, examples include, scheduling, sequencing, routing and admissions of jobs, and input and processing rate controls.  Networks of interest are in general quite complex and thus  one seeks tractable approximate models. The overall theme of  this research is the development of  techniques for obtaining good scheduling policies for general families of such stochastic processing systems using the mathematical theory of diffusion approximations.  The work will lead to improved design, stability and regulation of complex manufacturing, communication and computer systems. Research project will support the training of two graduate students and  develop international collaborations and with faculty from non-Ph.D. granting institutions."

The field of ecology is largely devoted to the study of these limiting factors.  Debates concerning the relative importance of different potentially limiting factors for particular microbe, plant, and animal taxa pervade the evolutionary ecology literature; prominent examples include extrinsic versus intrinsic sources of mortality, different macro- and micronutrients required for organismal growth, physical wear or breakage of different key structural features of an organism, resources versus predators in population regulation, pollen versus resource limitation in plants, and egg versus host limitation in insects. While important progress has been made developing theory to resolve these debates in particular contexts,  these theoretical treatments have been developed in isolation from one another. Many of these debates, however, share a common logical structure: the focal organism lives in a heterogeneous environment, has a finite pool of metabolic resources to ameliorate multiple limiting factors, and can not instantaneously adjust metabolic allocations to perfectly match the environment.  This project will develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing evolutionary problems with this logical structure, apply this framework to several major limiting factor debates in evolutionary ecology, and confront the modeling predictions with empirical data. The mathematical framework will provide broadly applicable methods at the interface of stochastic processes and dynamical systems. These methods will be used to understand (i) whether insects are limited by a finite supply of eggs or a short lifespan to locate hosts and (ii)  whether plants are limited by their ability to attract pollinators or by other aspects of reproduction. To establish a dialogue between the theory and the natural world, data on egg limitation and pollen limitation will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the theory. <br/><br/>Conservation and restoration ecologists are interested in anticipating the responses of animals and plants to changing environments and in being able to manipulate those responses to beneficial ends. This project will contribute to these goals by providing a deeper understanding of how organisms evolve in response to different factors that may limit reproductive success. A population of organisms whose fitness is consistently limited by one particular factor will respond predictably to perturbations of that factor. On the other hand, a population of organisms whose fitness is limited by different factors at different times or places will respond to perturbations less predictably. A key topic of this project, pollen limitation, has direct bearing on documented global declines in the populations of pollinating insects such as bees.  These population declines threaten plant communities and crop productivity world wide. Results from this project will be incorporated into a new course on pollination ecology, into two textbooks dealing with calculus and modeling as applied to the life sciences, and into entry-level courses for biology students. Moreover, undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates will be trained in a vertically integrated manner."

It aims to find new sharp inequalities for a class of Fourier multipliers that result from functional modifications of Levy processes via the Levy-Khintchine formula. It proposes to give universal bounds for the trace of the semigroup of Brownian motion, stable and relativistic stable processes and to explore the second order asymptotics for the spectral counting function for these processes.  The unifying theme in these investigations is the use of  <br/>the symbols of the underlying Levy process.

They are intimately related to a second order differential operator knows as the Laplacian.  This operator, named after the mathematical astronomer Marquis Pierre-Simon De Laplace more than two hundred years ago, gives the matheamtical foundation for the theory of heat, waves, electricity, magnetism and fluids. Both martingales and the Laplace operator interact with Brownian motion which models physical, biological and economic systems, and even with more general Levy processes which are widely used to model various financial systems which are subject to more instantaneous changes or jumps.  At the root of the interactions between martingales, the Laplace operator and Brownian motion, is a deep mathematical theory which makes these applications scientifically sound.  This project deals with several of these core questions and relates them to several other branches of mathematics including more general partial differential equations and their applications to the diffusion of heat, propagation of waves and their connections with random phenomenon.<br/><br/>These projects will involve graduate students.  The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the web.  A sincere effort will be made to expose (and involve) students and young Ph.D.'s from underrepresented groups to this research and to increase their participation in mathematics."

In particular, optimal design of joint ventures between two firms is addressed, that is, the optimal time to enter/exit a project, the optimal effort each should invest in it, and how they should share the profits/losses, thus extending the classical real options theory to the case of two agents.  New models for finding optimal compensation to managers are developed, in which the manager may have better information than the investors, and in which the investors may acquire better information at a cost.  Global properties of prices formed in equilibrium of financial markets with many agents are analyzed, in order to study what factors influence the volatility and the risk premium of the stock market.  In addition, the investigators model how prices locally evolve due to changes in  liquidity, for example in the presence of fast high-frequency traders.  Finally, in a model of a market with many interacting agents, the project explores how the average number of defaults and average loss evolve in the limit when the number of agents grows.<br/><br/>This project is particularly timely given that one of the reasons for the recent crisis in financial markets is the way traders and managers have been compensated.  It will help provide insight into what types of compensation schemes are optimal for the parties involved and for the society in general.  Another issue that needs better understanding if a similar crisis is to be prevented in the future, is how the markets evolve due to the interaction of many agents, and how lack of liquidity influences the behavior of the market participants and the prices. In particular, this research sheds light on the formation of asset prices, on portfolio strategies, and on the frequency of defaults that can be expected in markets with many agents, as well as how prices are formed in  markets with varying degrees of liquidity.  Thus, the results of the project will shed light on which issues to focus on when regulating compensation in financial markets and regulating the financial industry in general."

This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data set determine a distribution which would generate it.  By results of Reimann and Slaman, for all but countably many X there is such an m. The argument is highly meta-mathematical. Necessarily so, as Reimann and Slaman have also shown that this co-countability theorem cannot be proven without invoking infinitely many iterations of the power set of the reals. In the emerging picture, there is a close interaction between a sequence's failure to have a random ingredient and it's being structurally definable, which should be studied more deeply.<br/><br/>Slaman's proposal can be viewed in the context of the continuing investigation of computability and mathematical definability. With quantitative mathematical analysis of these phenomena, one can answer questions of the form ``Is there an algorithm to solve all problems of a this type?'', ``Is there a simple example with specific properties'', ``Is there a concrete classification of all structures with these properties?''. One can also address questions of the sort ``Are these techniques adequate to resolve this question?'' or ``How random must a sequence be in order to exhibit a particular typical behavior?''  One must develop a detailed theory of computation to show that there is no algorithm of a certain type. Similarly, one must develop a detailed theory of definability to show that there is no simple example with certain properties or to show that certain phenomena do not have concrete classifications."

In the second topic one interesting mathematical problem concerns ""explosive percolation"" conjectured to have a discontinuous transition, while the more biologically important question concerns how the outcomes of epidemics and ecological competitions change when they take place on random graphs, which arguably provide better models of the real social networks. The third topic concern situations in which the characteristics of individuals in ecological competitions are also not static but evolve in response to their environment. My first steps in the area ""adaptive dynamics"" were taken in a study of predator-prey systems with John Mayberry. Here, we propose to study more complex examples that lead to evolutionary cycling and a second problem on the evolution of virulence, which leads to consideration of the role of spatial structure in increasing the virulence of diseases.<br/><br/>Many interesting mathematical questions arise from biology. Here we address some questions that arise from ecology and evolution. Three examples should illustrate the nature of our work. (1) At the turn of the century, observations of social networks revealed that we live in a small world in which everyone on the planet is separated by six degrees of separation. Now we need to understand how this geometry of social networks effects the spread of epidemics and the other biological and social processes. (2) The world shows much more biodiversity than mathematical models predict, so it is important to understand the mechanisms which allow for species coexistence. More generally, we will also be interested in how spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological competition. (3) In most situations the characteristics of individuals involved in competition with other species or with infectious agents are not static but evolve in time. <br/>For example, in most cases diseases evolve to be less virulent, but in a spatially structured population the opposite may occur.

If the abundances of the constituent molecules of a reaction network are sufficiently high then the reaction network is typically modeled as a coupled set of ordinary differential equations.  If, however, the abundances are low then the standard deterministic models do not provide a good representation of the behavior of the system and stochastic models are used.  The simplest stochastic model treats the system as a continuous time Markov chain. More complicated models tend to be hybrid in nature with some components modeled discretely, some diffusively, and some absolutely continuously (that is, solutions of ordinary differential equations with stochastic inputs from the other components).  This project has two related goals.  The first is to develop rigorous results relating network structure---typically the simplest information to obtain experimentally about networks---with qualitative properties of the dynamics of reaction networks, and to do so in both the deterministic and stochastic settings.  The second goal is to develop and analyze numerical simulation methods for stochastically modeled systems that account for both the natural scalings and basic mathematical structure of reaction networks.  Stochastically modeled reaction networks often involve multiple natural scales and it is crucial that these natural scales be accounted for when developing and analyzing numerical simulation methods.  Also, all of the equations that describe reaction networks are of a very specific mathematical structure that can be utilized to develop efficient algorithms in both the discrete and continuous stochastic contexts.<br/><br/>All of the questions being addressed in this proposal have motivation from the biosciences. Recent advances in experimental methods concerning the dynamics of the cell (such as green fluorescent protein) have increased interest in how biological molecules interact at the cellular level over the course of time.  Because Brownian forces are significant at this level, stochastic models for these intracellular reaction networks, combined with analytical and computational tools, are essential if they are to be well understood.

The combinatorial objects of interest have delighted pure mathematicians for many years for their inherent beauty and elegant structure. But also, amazingly, such seemingly ""useless"" mathematics has turned out to have deep connections to branches of physics and to some very applied mathematical disciplines like probability theory and random matrix theory. Thus, for example, alternating-sign matrices are related to ""square ice"", a simplified model for an ice crystal studied by statistical physicists, while at the same time appearing in the study of an algorithm for computing matrix determinants, which are a ubiquituous concept used in practically all the sciences and engineering disciplines. And Young tableaux, which originated with the mathematical study of symmetry, have been found to be related to random matrix theory, an important mathematical theory which has its origins in attempts by nuclear physicists to model the complex interactions in the nuclei of heavy elements. The combination of theoretical elegance and applied utility makes these research topics highly attractive from a scientific standpoint, and also very suitable as the focus for educational activities planned by the investigator, which would have as their goals to attract promising students to mathematics and the sciences and to promote public appreciation of the value of scientific research.<br/>"
