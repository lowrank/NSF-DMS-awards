This research is at the interface of two fields: probability               and operator theory on infinite dimensional spaces.  Properties                 of operators (infinite dimensional matrices) are studied using                  ideas from probability and conversely the quest to understand                   these operators leads to new and interesting questions in pure                  probability."

The motivation for this research is Monte Carlo sampling from a                 complicated combinatorial object X.  If one can construct a                     process with state space X and stationary distribution uniform                  on X, and if one can show that the process converges in                         distribution to that stationary distribution rather rapidly, the                simulation of the process allows simulation of points nearly                    uniformly distributed in X.

In IFS generation an ergodic Markov chain is                   simulated in R2 or R3 through products of random affine                         transformations, and its trajectory is plotted to create an                     image.  The IFS encoding problem involves the construction of                   such a Markov chain so as to generate a given target image.  By                 exploiting the linearity of the transformations involved with                   these chains, one can encode any digital image, and for a broad                 class of images this affords substantial data compression.
