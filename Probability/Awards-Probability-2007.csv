They have drawn much of their inspiration and motivation from physics, biology, and computer science. They also have been used heavily in physics, biology, and computer science. In this proposal, Zhang focuses on three basic percolative models: an oriented percolation model, a first passage percolation model, and a percolation model. The research uses probability theorems (e.g., the martingale probability theorem, Markov chains, the CLT theorem, and correlation inequalities); graph theorems (e.g., for duality, lattice surfaces, and planarity); combinatorics (e.g., partition lattice, renormalization); and functional analysis (e.g., complex variables).<br/><br/>The proposed project promotes teaching experiences for Zhang's undergraduate students in the areas of engineering, computer science, and mathematics. Because issues and open questions in percolation theory are easy for students to understand, the proposed project also offers students an opportunity to conduct research activities on percolation problems. Furthermore, percolation theory is also directly applicable in biology, industry, and computer science. Thus, students will find it appealing to pursue investigations in this important area. In conclusion, the activities of students' research outlined in this project would contribute significantly to the quality of education at this institution. The proposed project also enhances technological and scientific understanding. Because percolation theory involves numerical computations and simulations, the project requires new technology in computing science."

In the first class of problems, the PI will develop a complete characterization of the almost sure behavior of the underlying stochastic flow in the neighborhood of a stationary (non-ergodic) solution. The effect of small perturbations on the almost sure qualitative structure of the stochastic flow will be studied near hyperbolic stationary solutions. Such small perturbations are natural because of unavoidable statistical errors in estimating the parameters of physical models against experimental inaccuracies in the measurement of real data. Issues of genericity and local stability will be addressed. In the second class of problems, a regular class of constrained stochastic systems with long memory will be identified. Such classes allow for the existence of smooth stochastic semiflows and hence a characterization of their invariant manifolds using suitably-modified ergodic theory techniques. The interplay between the geometry of the constraints and the stochastic dynamics will be examined. Weak and strong approximation schemes will be developed for stochastic systems with full memory and then applied to option-pricing models in mathematical finance with delayed stock-dynamics. The dynamics of the third class of problems will be studied by analyzing classical examples such as two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes and Burgers equations. The  proposed research is a long-term program that advocates novel links between probability theory/stochastic analysis and traditional mainstream mathematical disciplines such as dynamical systems, differential geometry and numerical analysis. In particular, the research would lead to new interactions between stochastic geometry and dynamical systems.<br/><br/>During the past decade, a considerable number of applied mathematicians, engineers and economists have turned their attention to randomly evolving systems with memory for modeling a variety of physical phenomena whose time evolution depends on their past history. In physics, laser dynamics with delayed feedback is often investigated, as well as the dynamics of noisy bi-stable systems with delay. In biophysics, random (viz. stochastic) systems with memory are used to model delayed visual feedback systems or human postural sway and in the design of cardiac pacemaker cells. In mathematical finance, the volatility of the stock may be dependent on its past history and hence the stock dynamics may be best described by a stochastic system with memory. The research in this project is expected to give a complete characterization of the stability structure near equilibria for a large class of infinite-dimensional models called stochastic partial differential equations. Such models are ubiquitous in the study of heat flow, the movement of fluids and modelling of climate change.<br/>The PI will complete the preparation of a research monograph on stochastic systems with memory. The monograph is intended to be the basis for a graduate course in mathematics at Carbondale. Stochastic systems with long-memory and their applications to option-pricing in mathematical finance will engage the PI's master's and doctoral graduate students, some of them are females and minorities. <br/>"

Since noise is ubiquitous in physical systems, it is natural to study the effect of noise on these systems.

The first stems from the recent discovery by the investigator and collaborators of a connection between the Tracy-Widom laws of RMT, their generalization to the so called ""beta-ensembles"", and a family of random Schroedinger operators.  This connection opens the door to a deeper understanding of the analytic structure of Tracy-Widom laws. It also presents a new method for investigating the universality question at the spectral edge for both random matrices and random Schroedinger.<br/>The second set of problems concerns bulk fluctuations for ensembles of matrices with no assumed symmetry.  Such questions are of growing interest in theoretical physics on account of the ties between these fluctuations and the Gaussian Free Field.  Finally, the investigator looks at several applications of RMT to wireless technology where probabilistic and analytic techniques from RMT are employed to estimate the capacity and performance of multiple-antenna communication systems with feedback.<br/><br/>Matrices and their spectra (eigenvalues) are fundamental objects throughout mathematics and its applications.  The study of random matrices (again, RMT) addresses the natural question: ""What do the eigenvalues of the typical matrix look like?""  Or, said another way: ""What properties of the spectra are universal in that they depend only on the rough characteristics (e.g. symmetries) of the matrix ensemble?"" It is therefore not surprising that RMT has serious impact in disparate areas of mathematics ranging from Statistics to Number Theory to Operator Algebras, as well as in Physics and Engineering.  On the theoretical front, this project brings new ideas to the study of the universal properties of the largest eigenvalues in symmetric matrices and also the bulk (or generic) eigenvalues in matrices without symmetry.  On the more directly applied side, this project looks at problems in the theory of wireless technology where, interestingly, the design and performance analysis of many efficient communication systems leads to mathematical problems cast in the language of RMT.  The engineering issues here are of the utmost practical importance - while the demand for wireless communications continues to grow, the spectrum remains a limited resource.  Presenting a natural setting for collaborations between mathematicians and electrical engineers, this project will sponsor joint meetings along with jointly mentored graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/>"

The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of solutions to the parabolic Anderson problem, the solutions to the equation of the evolution of a magnetic field in a random flow, and a variety of probabilistic aspects of transport phenomena. For the Anderson problem the study focuses on the equations with random time-dependent potential. In the scalar case this problem can be looked upon as a scalar model for the equation of the evolution of the magnetic field in a random flow. In the vector case the Anderson model is related to passive transport by random flows, which is also a subject of the current project. The study of transport phenomena is concerned with the long-time behavior of ensembles of points as well as connected sets under the action of a large class of physically relevant flows. <br/> Most of the proposed problems arise naturally in the study of various physical phenomena in meteorology, oceanography, and the theory of turbulence. In particular, when studying passive transport, one assumes that certain properties of the media are known (for example, while the temperatures or velocities on the surface of the ocean can not be measured in every single point exactly, certain statistical information is assumed to be available). The problem then consists of trying to predict the long-time behavior of a passive scalar (such as an oil spill carried by the currents on the surface of the ocean) based on the statistical properties of the underlying media. Several such problems can be formulated in relatively simple terms, yet the solutions are very non-trivial, and at times surprising. <br/>"

Based on the probabilistic properties of the flow, one wishes to describe the long time behavior of the substance carried by it. Many results in this direction have been obtained be several groups of researchers under various simplifying assumptions, such as the periodicity of the flow. We shall study the problem for a large class of physically relevant flows. <br/>"

The first is to try to classify ``quasi-stationary random overlap structures''. Random overlap structures arise in the study of mean-field spin glasses such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. They are analogous to random partition structures, but more general. Quasi-stationarity is an invariance property for random overlap structures, abstracted from the physicists' ``cavity step''. It is akin to exchangeability for deterministic mean-field spin systems. So, the proposal is to find and prove a spin-glass version of de Finetti's theorem. Unrelated to this, the PI will study the ferromagnetic Heisenberg quantum spin system. The Hamiltonian of this quantum model equals (one minus) the Markov generator of the symmetric exclusion process (SEP). Physicists' spin wave arguments suggest important conjectures for the spectrum of these operators. For example, one such conjecture turned out (after the fact) to be equivalent to Aldous's conjecture, that the spectral gap for the SEP equals the spectral gap for the random walk. The proposal is to try to prove these conjectures.<br/><br/>Spin glasses are unusual magnetic materials, which settle into stable configurations on short time scales, but hop from configuration to configuration on long times scales. So, depending on the length of time observed, they look either like solids or liquids. Glass does the same thing: for example, windows in very old churches are thicker at the bottom than the top, supposedly because the glass flowed down over time. Over 20 years ago, Giorgio Parisi, a physicist, proposed a unique solution to the simplest spin glass model. Only recently was his intuitive guess really proved by mathematicians. This led to interesting new math as well as new physics. But much remains to be done. Parisi made other guesses for problems in computer science. For many computational problems which involve finding an optimal solution, it is known that any algorithm is ``NP complete''. This means (it is strongly believed) that a program solving such problems would take inordinately long to run. On the other hand, Parisi and others proposed analytical solutions to random versions of many of these problems. Presumably, the next best thing to a foolproof solution is one that works with high probability. The property of quasi-stationarity seems to be inherent to all these heuristic solutions. So understanding it is important for an overall picture of the subject."

Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory.

In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

Typically the model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions. This lattice is infinite and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group.  The simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in the ground and gas flow through a gas mask. One asks how far fluid can flow, in particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far. This, of course, depends on the density of particles that block the flow; there is a phase transition as the density<br/>increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can no longer flow arbitrarily far. One would like to know where that point is and how the probability changes as this critical point is approached.

In many of these fields, the application of probabilistic and statistical methods has had a long history. A lot of effort has been spent on the development of plausible stochastic models and techniques to maximize expected values, minimize variances or control ruin probabilities. Considerably less work has been devoted to a systematic investigation of the concept of risk, its quantification and the implications for regulation and behavior. In particular, the study of consistent aggregation of risk, attribution of risk, or optimal management of risk in dynamic setups has only started recently. The goal of this project is to provide a mathematical framework for the quantification and management of risk in different contexts. Formally, a risk measure is a functional on a space of random variables or stochastic processes. An important aspect of the project will be the study of the mathematical structure of such functionals with a view towards important properties like monotonicity, convexity or time-consistency. But also the tractability of related optimization problems, practical applications and numerical implementations will be investigated. This will involve methods from probability theory, statistics, convex analysis, locally convex vector spaces and numerical mathematics.<br/><br/>The project explores the quantification and management of risks faced by individuals, companies and society in different situations of uncertainty. The main focus of the project is to provide mathematical tools for the assessment, control, mitigation and minimization of risk. Practical problems to be addressed are optimal portfolio allocation; the pricing, hedging and design of financial derivatives; the valuation of complex insurance products such as equity-linked insurance contracts; the determination of capital requirements for banks and insurance companies; coherent attribution of risks; optimal risk transfer between financial institutions; the securitization of risks; integrated risk management; the valuation of energy contracts; the optimal operation of power plants; and the assessment of risk faced by society through financial crises, under-funded pension plans or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. The general treatment of risk and the investigation of different concrete problems are expected to motivate new concepts and the transfer of expertise between different fields. <br/>"

This is the subject of their Cambridge University Press book, Markov Processes, Gaussian Processes and Local Times, which was published in October 2006. In writing this book they solved many problems and uncovered many new ones. They are particularly interested in finding a heuristic explanation, based on sample path properties, of the fact that Gaussian processes with infinitely divisible squares are precisely those Gaussian processes with covariance that is the zero potential density of a strongly symmetric Markov process. They will also continue their program of using Gaussian process techniques to discover new sample path properties of local times, such as central limit theorems for the moduli of continuity of local times of Markov processes. In continuing to explore the interplay between Gaussian and Markov processes they will also consider non-normal central limit theorems for the moduli of continuity of Gaussian processes with convex covariance functions as a first step towards obtaining similar properties for local times. <br/><br/><br/>Many important phenomena, such as weather patterns or the behavior of the stock market, are so complex that the only way to study them is to consider them as random, or stochastic, processes. Mathematical models of stochastic processes are studied to give insight into the physical phenomena that they represent. On subtle property of a stochastic process is the amount of time realizations of the process spend at the possible values that it can take. This property is called the local time of the process.

A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.  Since the path-breaking work of Belavin, Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov in the 1970's and 1980's, it has been understood---at least heuristically---that the laws of certain macroscopic observables of these systems should be invariant under conformal maps from one planar domain to another.  Over the past two decades, physicists have developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for understanding the properties of random objects with conformal symmetries. During the past few years, several mathematicians have begun to rigorously prove some of the predictions from the physics literature, along with many additional results.  Many of the these problems have natural higher dimensional analogs that we are only beginning to understand.

Real-world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion of vehicles on a freeway,   packets making their way through a communication network, fluid particles in a tube, wetting transitions where fluid spreads in a porous medium, or epidemics advancing through an orchard of trees.

The moment method has been explored in studying the intersection local times and ranges for about two decades. The classic applications include the existence and weak convergence of intersection local times. In this setting, the power of the moment is fixed. To study the large deviations for these models, however,  one needs to understand the asymptotic behaviors of the moments as the power increases to infinity. In recent years, there have been new development in this direction. The method developed along this line is called high moment asymptotics. Even in its early stage, the method of high moment asymptotics has shown its power in the areas of intersection local times and of the local times of additive Levy processes.<br/><br/>Understanding large deviations for intersection local times and related models is crucial for the applications to Euclidean quantum field theory, the growth of  polymers,  and the polaron problem. Carrying out this project will lead to the solution of some hard problems remaining in this area and to the development of new methodology.The problems addressed can be clearly stated without too much technical jargon and therefore can be easily explained to the non-experts. In this regard, the project will benefit mathematical education and help attracting more students to mathematics and probability in particular.<br/>"

The basic idea of IS to simulate the system under a different probability distribution, and correct for biasedness via the likelihood ratio. During the last three decades, most of the IS schemes that were developed were based on heuristics, and led to algorithms with questionable performance.  In contrast, this research project develops a systematic methodology for the construction of simple, efficient IS schemes for broad classes of process models.  This approach capitalizes on the intimate connection between IS and a related differential game.  It turns out that subsolutions to the Isaacs equation associated with the game can be used to build IS schemes whose performance can be rigorously characterized.  The investigators are particularly interested in developing both theoretical and practical aspects of importance sampling in the areas of stochastic networks, metastability analysis, systems with discontinuous dynamics, small noise diffusions, counting problems, analysis of higher-order moments of IS estimators, and heavy-tailed distributions.  The project will also study the use of subsolutions for the construction and analysis of fast simulation methods based on branching processes, such as splitting and RESTART.<br/><br/>Rare events, such as transitions between stable wells in a model from chemical physics, data loss in a highly reliable communication system, or unexpectedly large payouts in insurance claims, are often key quantitative measures of a system's overall behavior.  They also play a central role in risk assessment and management.  Reliable numerical methods are required in order to design systems and protocols that can minimize and mitigate the negative effects of rare events.  The main technique for the fast simulation of rare events is importance sampling.  Importance sampling algorithms have been developed over the last thirty years for many different application areas.  However, the development to date has been largely ad hoc and without a proper theoretical foundation.  Practitioners have relied on a few rudimentary heuristics in constructing importance sampling algorithms.  The performance of these schemes was supported by limited numerical evidence, and unfortunately recent work has shown that these heuristics are in general unreliable.  This project brings new ideas from probability theory and tools from game theory and partial differential equations to the problem of design and analysis of importance sampling schemes.  The work aims to develop systematic methods for the construction and rigorous analysis of reliable algorithms.<br/>"

As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. Roughly, after a suitable scaling, the density of particles in a gas with grazing collisions converges to a solution of Landau Equation, the density of coagulating and fragmenting clusters converges to a solution of Smoluchowski Equation, and a rough interface modeled by Hamilton-Jacobi PDE with inhomogeneity (impurity) homogenizes to a homogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Many issues related to these models are not understood. Large-deviations type questions for the homogenization and gases would provide us valuable informations about the corresponding microscopic models. The phenomenon of gelation for the Smoluchowski Equation is still a mystery and our understanding of the corresponding microscopic phenomenon should help resolving some open problems in this context. <br/><br/><br/>Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale? Roughly the reason is that the local conservation laws impose constraints not immediately visible on the microscopic scale. The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids, gases and crystals. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting particles is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of our microscopic world such as the formation of gels, the roughness of the surface boundary of solids, the occurrence of sharp corners in crystals,.... <br/><br/>"

Several different methodologies will be brought to bear: a probabilistic reformulation of the cavity method from statistical physics, local weak convergence for establishing existence of limits as network size grows, as well as more standard techniques from probabilistic combinatorics and random graphs.  Some of these techniques will also be applied to various combinatorial optimization problems over random data, examining a conjecture relating computational hardness of problem to structure of near-optimal solutions.<br/><br/>Network flow problems have been studied in many different disciplines:  Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, Transportation Engineering, Regional Economics.   The proposal initiates systematic mathematical study of abstracted models of these problems in the context of random networks, where randomness is used to capture the idea of networks not being centrally designed.  Mathematicians have techniques for studying very large systems without doing exact calculations (which become more difficult as systems get larger) which are separate from the techniques more familiar to engineers. The broader impacts envisaged are facilitating the spread of techniques between different research communities and providing additional tools for the design of large networks.<br/>"

Specifically, we look at random walks on the d-dimensional Euclidean lattice, whose transition probabilities are a stationary random field indexed by the vertices of the lattice. Most emphasis will be put on i.i.d. environments. In general the behavior of RWRE can be very different from that of regular random walk. Both in one-dimension and in non-elliptic multidimensional environments, one may witness phenomena that do not exist in regular random walk, such as sub-ballisticity (i.e. when the walk is transient in a certain direction, but move at asymptotic speed zero) and sub-diffusivity (i.e. when the typical distance from the origin grows at a scale that is significantly less than the square-root of the time). In many other cases the RWRE is conjectures to behave similarly to the regular random walk. However, proofs are known only for few cases, most notably for reversible environments and for environments that are small perturbations of the simple random walk. Despite the rapid progress in recent years, many basic questions regarding RWRE are still open, most notably the question of 0-1 law for directional transience and the question of ballisticity for directionally transient random walk in random high-dimensional elliptic environments.<br/><br/>Random walks are one of the most studied objects in probability theory. Its importance stems, in part, from the fact that it is a natural model for many real world phenomena such as diffusion, migration and even market fluctuations, and as a natural tool in the study of other objects such as laplace equations, heat conductance and more. While the theory of simple random walks is well developed, most of its techniques rely heavily on the perfect regularity of the environments in which it takes place. Since in many real-world models such regularity does not hold, RWRE is, in fact, a better representation of real-world phenomena than the simple random walk. Thus our aim is to develop new techniques that will facilitate study of RWRE.<br/>"

We will extend our analysis of the impact of the fixation of beneficial mutations, develop analytical results to help quantify the effects of Hill-Robertson interference, which occurs when a second advantageous mutation occurs before the first one reaches fixation and study diffusion approximations for the related problem of codon usage bias. We will obtain rigorous results for the sequentially Markovian coalescent, which has recently been introduced as an approximation for genealogies with recombination, investigate the nature of regulatory sequence evolution in Drosophila and other organisms with large effective population size; study the subfunctionalization explanation of the persistence of gene duplicates, and consider random Boolean networks, in order to gain insights into gene networks. Inspired by ecology, we will use spatial models to understand conditions needed for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation between individuals, and we will investigate changes that occur when the parameters governing the interactions in predator-prey and epidemic models evolve.<br/>The last decade has seen the generation of incredible amounts of DNA sequence data. However, having the text of the instruction manual that controls life is just the beginning, we need to understand how the expression of genes is controlled and how genes interact in biological networks. These interactions cannot be directly observed so one needs to develop mathematical models to test hypotheses, and to infer how genetic systems evolved to operate as they do. In particular, our research will investigate (i) how rapidly changes can occur due to regulatory sequence evolution, which is commonly quoted explanation for many of the differences between humans and chimpanzees, (ii) whether or not the subfunctionalization hypothesis provides a satisfactory explanation of the paradox of the preservation of gene duplicates, and (iii) to improve our understanding the patterns of variations caused by adaptive evolution. These are just three examples of many at the interface between biology and mathematics. An important aspect of our proposal is to train graduate students to work in this exciting area.<br/>"

The first problem is to develop tools for using local mixing properties of a Markov chain to understand convergence in the global sense of the mixing time. The investigator hopes to apply these tools to analyze the connection between spatial mixing and temporal mixing in spin sytems. The investigator will also study problems relating to exclusion processes. One example is Aldous's conjecture that in the symmetric exclusion process the spectral gap does not depend on the number of particles. Further problems concern asymmetric exclusion; for some of these models the mixing time is believed to be lower than the corresponding symmetric version but existing techniques cannot verify this.<br/><br/>  In recent years a large body of mathematics has been developed relating to finding the mixing time of a Markov chain. A problem that illustrates this body of research is that of determining how many shuffles are necessary to randomize a deck of cards. Here, mathematicians have had great success, finding very precise answers for many models of card shuffling. However, interest in mixing times is not limited to card shuffling since Markov chains are a crucial tool for applications in a wide range of areas. Simulations of Markov chains consume an enormous number of computer cycles each year and are applied in such areas as computer algorithms, statistics and statistical physics.<br/>"

The P.I. intends to continue his studies of the distribution of the largest eigenvalues in Wigner, sample covariance, and related ensembles of random matrices. The proposed research is closely related to the Tracy-Widom distribution of the largest eigenvalues of Hermitian and real symmetric random matrices that appears in many important problems in physics, statistics, and theoretical computer science: crystal shapes, exclusion processes, directed polimers in random media, principal component analysis.  In particular, the P.I. proposes to establish  Tracy-Widom distribution in some important ensembles of random  matrices.  Recently, the P.I. discovered Poisson statistics of the largest eigenvalues in random matrices with power-law tailed elements. Remarkably, such matrices very often appear in financial applications.  The P.I. intends to continue his studies of heavy-tailed random matrices and, in particular, to study in detail the transition form the Tracy-Widom regime to the Poisson regime. <br/><br/>The random matrix models studied in the project come from or have applications in nuclear physics (statistics of energy levels of heavy nuclei), mathematical statistics (principal component analysis), theoretical computer science (computational complexity, statistical analysis of errors, linear numerical algorithms), population biology, mathematical finance, and solid state physics (modeling transport properties of small metallic particles and quantum dots).  The importance of the field has increased significantly in the last ten years as many different areas of mathematics and physics including combinatorics, representation theory, number theory, quantum gravity, integrable systems, and random growth models have been shown to possess deep and fruitful connections to random matrix theory.<br/>"

This is the subject of their Cambridge University Press book, Markov Processes, Gaussian Processes and Local Times, which was published in October 2006. In writing this book they solved many problems and uncovered many new ones. They are particularly interested in finding a heuristic explanation, based on sample path properties, of the fact that Gaussian processes with infinitely divisible squares are precisely those Gaussian processes with covariance that is the zero potential density of a strongly symmetric Markov process. They will also continue their program of using Gaussian process techniques to discover new sample path properties of local times, such as central limit theorems for the moduli of continuity of local times of Markov processes. In continuing to explore the interplay between Gaussian and Markov processes they will also consider non-normal central limit theorems for the moduli of continuity of Gaussian processes with convex covariance functions as a first step towards obtaining similar properties for local times. <br/><br/><br/>Many important phenomena, such as weather patterns or the behavior of the stock market, are so complex that the only way to study them is to consider them as random, or stochastic, processes. Mathematical models of stochastic processes are studied to give insight into the physical phenomena that they represent. On subtle property of a stochastic process is the amount of time realizations of the process spend at the possible values that it can take. This property is called the local time of the process. This proposal is to continue research on the local times of symmetric Markov processes."
