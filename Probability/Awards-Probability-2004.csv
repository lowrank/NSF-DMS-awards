Conference organizers structure activities to provide as much opportunity as possible for discussions among conference participants, and to create an environment that is welcoming of young researchers and graduate students who wish to present their work.  Several introductory short courses on topics ranging from stochastic calculus with financial applications, to graphical models, and model selection in a Bayesian framework, are taught.  In addition, special discussion sessions on course topics are organized, to facilitate the interaction between young researchers and their more senior colleagues. <br/><br/><br/>In the past twelve years, collaboration between Latin American and US mathematical scientists has increased many-fold.  One important consequence has been the growth of well-trained students from Latin American institutions who choose to enroll in graduate programs in American universities and who then develop close and enduring ties to the US academic community.  In part, this increased interaction is due to the series of Latin American conferences in probability and statistics, that are generally held every two years in a Latin American country, and that typically include a significant contingent of US participants.  The conferences have grown both in size and importance over time, and have contributed to the creation of a community of applied probabilists and statisticians who are eager to work in interdisciplinary teams to solve complex problems of importance to society.  The National Science Foundation, through its funding of travel awards for US scientists and for scientists from selected Latin American countries excluding Cuba , has been an important sponsor of these workshops.  The funding requested from NSF for the IX Latin American conference will be used to partially cover travel expenses of 10 US participants and of six Latin American conference participants  from countries other than Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>"

The problems in flows involve rates of dispersion of a set of passive tracers carried by the flow. Of special interest here are the set of ballistic points, those which travel at a linear rate that greatly exceeds the diffusive rate. The PI will examine the Hausdorff dimension of this set of points and the structure of the image of the set of points which have traveled at a superdiffusive rate. Another problem is the study of the length of a curve moving under the flow. The PI will attempt to show, under the assumption that the top Lyapunov exponent is positive, that the length grows exponentially at a rate greater than the top Lyapunov exponent. The PI also proposes to study solutions of the parabolic Anderson equation in both the scalar and vector case. The problems in the vector case involve establishing exponential growth rates for magnetic fields generated by turbulent velocity fields. In the scalar case, the problems involve gaining more insight into the properties of solutions. <br/> The proposed problems on stochastic flows are motivated by the motion of pollutants on the ocean surface or in ground water. A stochastic flow is a convenient model for the motion of particles under the effect of ocean currents. The proposed work on the parabolic Anderson model arises from a problem in astrophysics called the dynamo problem. The solution of a vector version of the parabolic Anderson equation models the magnetic field in a young star. The basic open question in astrophysics which will be approached by the PI is whether the magnetic field grows exponentially fast and to determine the exponential growth rate. <br/>"

They have drawn much of their inspiration and motivation from physics, biology and computer science. They have also been used heavily in physics, biology, industry, and computer science. This project focuses on the following percolation questions: <br/>General percolation model: <br/>(a) The power laws and scaling relations. <br/>(b) The central limit theorems for the incipient infinite cluster. <br/>(c) Percolation on arbitrary words. <br/>(d) On the infinite differentiability of the right edge in oriented percolation. <br/>First passage percolation: <br/>(a) Non-differentiability of the time constant. <br/>(b) The large deviations. <br/>The research makes use of probability theorems (martingale, Markov chains, CLT theorem, correlation inequalities), graph theorems (duality, lattice surfaces, planarity), combinatorics (partition lattice, renormalization) and functional analysis (complex variables). <br/> The project has a broad impact on research, education and dissemination to advance scientific and technological understanding in the following ways: First, percolation theory is one of most important subjects in mathematics. In fact, issues and open questions in percolation theory are easy to state, but whose solutions are apparently difficult and require innovative methods. Furthermore, percolation theory is also directly applicable in biology, industry, and computer science. Zhang presents six traditional problems in this field and proposed new methods to solve them. Second, the proposal promotes teaching experiences for Zhang's undergraduate students in areas of engineering, computer science and mathematics. It also offers an opportunity for the students to conduct research activities on percolation problems. Moreover, the proposal also enhances scientific and technological understanding. Since percolation theory involves numerical computations and simulations, technological advances in computing science are required. <br/>"

These include the problem of characterization of probability distributions satisfying dimension free concentration properties and related Sobolev-type inequalities, the KLS-conjecture on the dominating role of linear functionals with respect to logarithmically concave measures, the problem of existence and asymptotic normality of typical distributions in randomized models of summation. The PI also plans to address new aspects of the concentration phenomenon of product measures under additional symmetry hypotheses. As closely related, part of this activity is devoted to finite dimensional de Finetti representations for permutation invariant probability measures on product spaces and their applications to quantifying the rate of dependence of elements in long finite exchangeable sequences. A separate part is devoted to analysis of random walks on discrete structures and focuses on developing techniques based on suitable modified forms of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. <br/> The study of concentration phenomena is motivated, in particular, by classical problems of probability and statistics about general global properties of smooth functionals of stochastic processes. Concentration tools are also of great importance in asymptotic convex geometry where one explores the role of the dimension of high-dimensional convex objects. This area of research has become rather rich and proved to be useful due to the universal character of applications; on the other hand, it has accumulated a number of fundamental open questions attracting many investigators. The proposed research is aimed to push forward the study of multidimensional phenomena and to explore their connections with important effects related to the weak dependence in a broad sense. <br/>"

In particular, he will look at three specific problems. First, he will study the relationship between small deviations under different norms. This can allow results obtained under one norm to be modified so that they are true under a different norm. Second, he will look at the small deviation probabilities for Gaussian processes with specific forms of the covariance kernel. Finally, he will study the small deviation asymptotic behavior of some Gaussian random fields including the Brownian sheet. The PI believes that some combination of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, Fourier analysis and geometric methods will allow significant progress to be made on each of these problems.<br/> Stochastic processes move randomly through space and time. Simple descriptions of these processes tell where they should be located as a function of time (the mean process) and what their range should be. Probabilists have studied large deviations (events where the process is far away from where it should be) for many years. Now they are turning to small deviations (events where the range of the process is much smaller than it should be). This research focuses on small deviations for Gaussian processes (processes whose underlying structure is the normal distribution).<br/>"

The goal is to break new ground in this area of mathematics by proposing and solving new problems and, at the same time, devising a substantial research program for further investigation. Path and loop spaces over a Riemannian manifold are naturally equipped with the basic ingredients for an analytic theory, namely, the Wiener measure and a differentiable structure. These are important infinite dimensional mathematical and physical models. The PI will study the following problems concerning these models: (1) Integration by parts formula for manifolds with the Neumann boundary conditions (adiabatic case); (2) Logarithmic Sobolev and related inequalities for simply-connected manifolds; (3) Couplings of Brownian motions on manifolds, especially the problem of maximal couplings; (4) Infinite dimensional mass transportation problems related to the Wiener measure. <br/> The importance of mathematical objects, such as path and loop spaces over Riemannian manifolds, has been recognized by mathematicians and physicists for quite some time. The need for their study is motivated by a variety of problems in applicable mathematics and theoretical and applied physics. A better understanding of these models from the mathematical as well as from the physical points of view will contribute to our current knowledge in these two fields. The practical aspects of these investigations will become significant in the future development of mathematical and physical sciences. <br/>"

This approach has been very successful, often for finding the quenched asymptotic behavior when two levels of randomness are present, conditioned on a fixed, typical realization of one element of randomness. The proposed activity focuses on the applications of this approach in two directions:<br/><br/>1. Experiments and simulations involving dynamical systems out of equilibrium report an aging phenomenon, that is ""memory"" being accumulated in the system. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem of statistical physics relates the time derivative of the correlation function at equilibrium to the effect of small perturbations in the dynamical equations. It is predicted in the physics literature that aging is related to a specific form of breakup of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. One goal of the proposed activity is to form the mathematical version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, to understand the causes of the aging mechanism, and to rigorously relate the two.<br/><br/>2. The Gaussian free field and the Brownian motion are two fundamental random objects of great intrinsic beauty and much interest in probability theory (as well as in mathematical physics). The PI and his collaborators have been very successful in studying the fractal geometry of the extremal points of the occupation measure and covering process associated with planar Brownian motion and random walks. Recent works by the PI's students, their collaborators, and others, suggest strong similarity between the extremes of the Gaussian free field and those of the Brownian motion, as well as novel relations between contour lines of random height functions, those of the Gaussian free field and certain conformally invariant loop ensembles. Pursuing further this similarity, one goal of the proposed activity is to gain new insights and develop novel connections between the planar Gaussian free field and Brownian motion. <br/><br/> Over the past three decades, the physics community has developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for making very accurate predictions about the asymptotics of random dynamics, Gibbs measures, and planar objects with conformal symmetries. More recently, mathematicians started making significant progress in developing the corresponding rigorous theories and proving some of these predictions. One of the key tools in this process has been the theory of large deviations and the intuition behind it. The proposed activity is partially motivated by such non-rigorous physics predictions. As such, it is expected to result in new mathematical ideas and techniques that, beyond the immediate resolution of challenging problems of much interest to probabilists, would have an impact on the interface between probability theory and statistical physics. This grant will provide graduate training of students in probability theory. The techniques to be developed in this proposal are also expected to have future applications to the theory and practice of universal non-linear filtering, a problem of relevance and much interest for communication theory (see the URL www-stat.stanford.edu/~amir/ for some related activity and preprints). <br/>"

The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of solutions to the parabolic Anderson problem, the solutions to the equation of the evolution of a magnetic field in a random flow, and a variety of probabilistic aspects of transport phenomena. For the Anderson problem the study focuses on the equations with random time-dependent potential. In the scalar case this problem can be looked upon as a scalar model for the equation of the evolution of the magnetic field in a random flow. In the vector case the Anderson model is related to passive transport by random flows, which is also a subject of the current project. The study of transport phenomena is concerned with the long-time behavior of ensembles of points as well as connected sets under the action of a large class of physically relevant flows. <br/> Most of the proposed problems arise naturally in the study of various physical phenomena in meteorology, oceanography, and the theory of turbulence. In particular, when studying passive transport, one assumes that certain properties of the media are known (for example, while the temperatures or velocities on the surface of the ocean can not be measured in every single point exactly, certain statistical information is assumed to be available). The problem then consists of trying to predict the long-time behavior of a passive scalar (such as an oil spill carried by the currents on the surface of the ocean) based on the statistical properties of the underlying media. Several such problems can be formulated in relatively simple terms, yet the solutions are very non-trivial, and at times surprising. <br/>"

Many of these questions are set in a group-invariant context and the goal is to understand how geometric or algebraic properties of the group are reflected in probabilistic properties of the processes. The PI is working to establish basic topological properties of higher-dimensional analogues of random forests and to establish conjectures that arise by analogy to percolation. Phase transitions and entropy of other determinantal dynamical systems are also under investigation. Coupling questions are also at the heart of some stochastic comparison inequalities being studied. Basic questions concern comparison of the behavior of random walks in two random environments. <br/> The field of statistical physics is concerned to a great extent with mathematical models of phase transitions (e.g., water to ice). Typically the model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions. This lattice is infinite and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group. The simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in the ground and gas flow through a gas mask. One asks how far fluid can flow, in particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far. This, of course, depends on the density of particles that block the flow; there is a phase transition as the density increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can no longer flow arbitrarily far. One would like to know where that point is and how the probability changes as this critical point is approached. About 15 years ago, several researchers began investigating lattices that are quite different from the usual Euclidean ones that are most familiar and that most closely correspond to our physical world. These new lattices, called nonamenable, are also usually based on groups. Such investigations began out of the usual scientific and mathematical curiosity that drives fundamental research. Within the last 8 years, this area of research, statistical physics on nonamenable groups, has seen an explosion of interest. This area of research turns out to be quite rich and to contain a large number of important fundamental questions whose answers remain unknown. Already, there have been applications to Euclidean lattices of some of the new ideas that have arisen in response to the need to develop new tools for nonamenable groups. <br/>"

The project has four components. The first part studies reflected diffusions that arise as approximations to multi-class stochastic networks with cooperative servers (i.e. servers that use all the excess capacity allocated to one class in order to serve other classes). The estimation of functionals of these diffusions is complicated by the fact that these diffusions often fail to be semimartingales. The current project describes new techniques for the pathwise analysis of these diffusions. The second part of the research aims to first establish general sufficient conditions for uniqueness of differential equations that have discontinuous drifts and to then use these conditions to characterize fluid limits of queueing networks that exhibit discontinuous transition mechanisms in the interior of their domains. The third part is devoted to the analysis of phase transitions and Gibbs measures associated with a class of stochastic loss networks that appear as models of multicasting in telecommunication networks. The last part focuses on the design of optimal controls for a class of non-stationary queueing networks. <br/> Over the last decade the increasing complexity of telecommunication, computer and manufacturing systems has emphasized the need for the systematic development of tools for their analysis, design and control. Since an exact analysis of these stochastic systems is often infeasible one resorts to an asymptotic analysis that is appropriate for the performance measure of interest. Three asymptotic regimes of interest are the fluid regime, which captures the mean behavior of the system, the diffusion regime, which describes stochastic variations around the mean and the large deviations regime, which analyzes probabilities of events that are rare, but of crucial importance to the operation of the network (such as, for example, data loss in a computer network). This project will develop tools that facilitate the asymptotic analysis (in each of the three regimes) of important classes of stochastic networks that arise naturally in applications. In particular, the tools developed are expected to be useful for the estimation of important network performance measures such as stability and buffer overflow probabilities and also for the design of optimal controls. <br/>"

These include models of spatial growth and competition, and models of epidemics and endemics in geographically structured populations. A substantial part of the research will be directed to the behavior of certain interacting systems on noneuclidean and other nonstandard graphs. Particular problems to be investigated will include coexistence of competing species, growth and spread of populations, weak-to-strong survival transitions, and spatial propagation of epidemics and endemics. These have important connections with other developing areas of probability, especially percolation, first-passage percolation, and random graph theory. Secondary foci of the project will be on (1) analytic techniques for studying systems of generating functions, both finite and infinite, especially those that arise in random walk and related combinatorial enumeration problems on tree-like structures; and (2) signal extraction and inference procedures for time series generated by chaotic dynamical systems. <br/> Stochastic interacting particle systems are widely used as models in various areas of science, especially in statistical physics and in population biology, but also in economics. These systems consist of ""particles"" (which in different contexts may represent molecules, biological organisms, economic agents, etc.) that interact in various ways, but generally in a non-deterministic fashion. Mathematical studies of such systems seek to understand how large-scale collective phenomena (such as magnetism, propagation of epidemics in large populations, tumor growth, etc.) arise from and are determined by the details of the individual particle interactions. An important goal of this project is to contribute to our understanding of how the geometry describing the interactions between particles affects the nature of macroscopic behavior, and in particular, to understand how the behavior of certain model particle systems may vary in unusual geometries that may describe social and biological connections in certain animal and human populations.<br/>"

They also intend to continue their research concentrating on the First Ray-Knight Theorem, the one classical isomorphism theorem for the local times of Brownian motion that they have not been able to extend, and to consider a problem raised by Symanzik in quantum field theory, involving self-intersection local times. Professor Marcus plans to continue his research on the continuity and boundedness of stochastic convolutions with respect to infinitely divisible processes. Professor Rosen intends to study large deviations and exponential integrability for functionals of Markov processes related to intersections. He also intends to study fine properties of the geometry of the simple random walk in two dimensions. <br/> The research of Professors Marcus and Rosen is aimed at understanding the structure of stochastic processes. Stochastic processes are models for the evolution of random phenomena in time. However, even though the processes are random they contain some fundamental inner structure which when understood makes them in some sense predictable. Global warming is a good example. The temperature varies, day by day and season by season. There is a fundamental question: Is the average temperature getting warmer, or is the warming we seem to be witnessing simply a short term fluctuation of a basically stable weather pattern? The research supported by this grant does not attempt to answer this specific question. It is instead a study of the fundamental properties of random structures, which may give the tools to more effectively deal with important questions such as this one. <br/>"

The goal is to obtain mathematical results that describe behavior over large space and time scales in terms of limit theorems, and roughness of interfaces or fluctuations in particle flow by order-of-magnitude exponents, limit distributions, and large deviation rate functions. The emphasis is on finding new phenomena, and on capturing the overall picture of connections between different classes of microscopic rules and the associated large-scale behavior. One particular problem of interest in the context of asymmetric systems is the fluctuations of the current across a characteristic of the partial differential equation that describes the macroscopic evolution of the system. <br/> The objective of this research is precise mathematical understanding of certain kinds of macroscopic phenomena that result from interactions among a large number of microscopic components. The project studies mathematical models that include randomness in the behavior of the individual components. These models are abstractions of basic principles of organization and behavior common to many types of complex systems. The goal is to describe the typical large scale behavior of the model, and also to quantify the chances of deviations from the typical behavior. Complex interactions occur all around us in natural and man-made processes. Examples include cars on a freeway, customers in a queue, packets making their way through a communication network, or fluid particles in a tube. Consequently understanding the mathematics of complex interactions has potentially wide implications for science and engineering. Models of the types described in the proposal and others related to them are concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers.<br/>"

The importance of this project comes from the following three reasons: First, the area of sample intersections is full of mathematical elegance and surprise. It is also of great interest to the people working in the fields of physical and biological sciences. Second, this study is a crucial step toward understanding the asymptotic patterns (at the exponential level) of additive functionals and local times of the multi-parameter processes. As a concrete example of the local times run by multi-parameter processes, the long term behaviors of intersection local times locally resemble those of the local times of Brownian sheets. Third, the problems involved are often mathematically challenging. The intersection local times are the processes with strong memory and sharp singularity. Many of the results proved in this field show a heavy dimension dependence, which results from a combination of these two factors. In existing literature, a substantial difference between self-intersection and inter-path intersection has also been observed in the multi-dimensional cases. Compared with other aspects of the study, such as the weak laws, much less has been known in the limit behaviors such as large deviations, small ball probabilities and related strong limit laws. Recently, the proposer and his collaborators have made some substantial progress on the exponential asymptotics and the law of the iterated logarithm for the intersection local times run by Brownian motions, stable processes and random walks. The progress suggests further questions and establishments in broader situations. The project concerns three types of models, to which the exponential asymptotics will be investigated: The intersection local times of random walks and some more general processes; the range and intersection of ranges of the random walks; and the local times and additive functionals of multi-parameter processes. <br/> It is a well known fact in the biological and physical communities that the notion of intersection local times is an effective tool in the study of polymer and polaron models. This project is related to the long term behaviors of these models. The study will advance our knowledge on how the systems evolve in various scales. Therefore, the success of this project will also have impact on some areas in the biological and physical sciences. <br/>"

One of the main features of modern classification techniques is that they take into account the distribution of the so called classification margins (large margin methods), the quantities that characterize the reliability of classification. However, the margins alone do not give a satisfactory explanation of the superb performance of these methods. To provide such an explanation one has to combine margin type parameters with complexities of the classification rules in rather sophisticated upper confidence bounds. The goal of the research is to use concentration inequalities and various tools from the theory of Gaussian, empirical and Rademacher processes to develop new, much more subtle and powerful bounds of this type, that would lead to a much better understanding of the performance of the existing large margin classification methods and suggest ways to develop statistically optimal large margin procedures. The research includes the study of limit theorems and inequalities for ratio type empirical processes; the study of localized complexities of function classes involved in learning algorithms and the development of new bounds on generalization performance in terms of individual complexities of combined classifiers; the investigation of convergence rates of the empirical margin distribution to the true margin distribution of classifiers in terms of localized and individual complexities; the study of convergence rates of learning algorithms and the development of adaptive classification algorithms with optimal convergence rates; and the investigation of spectral properties of random matrices that play important role in learning theory for kernel machines. <br/> Learning Theory is a rapidly growing area between Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics that deals with modeling the process of learning and generalization in both biological and artificial neural networks and other learning machines. The results of the research are likely to facilitate further development of boosting, kernel machines, and other learning techniques and lead to new probabilistic bounds and asymptotic results in the theory of empirical processes with potential applications to many problems in statistical learning theory and other areas of Statistics. Methods of statistical learning theory have been penetrating many important areas of applications ranging from biotechnology to computer security. One of the topics of the proposed research is to develop applications of large margin learning methods in the area of robust control, in particular, to the problem of congestion control in communication networks. The results of the research are likely to impact this and other areas of applications. <br/>"

Importance sampling is a widely used Monte Carlo simulation technique for the estimation of quantities that are largely determined by rare events. With few exceptions, importance sampling algorithms are based on a change of measure that is not allowed to adapt in the course of generating a sample. Recent studies, however, indicate that these schemes may fail miserably in very common circumstances. These difficulties reflect the absence of a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling. One contribution of the proposed research is to build such a foundation in a general setting. Roughly speaking, at the heart of any importance sampling problem is a stochastic game, and an understanding of this game is the key to designing and analyzing efficient importance sampling algorithms. This perspective motivates the concept of dynamic importance sampling, where the change of measure is allowed to vary depending on the simulation history. It can be shown that dynamic schemes, properly designed, are optimal in a suitable sense. The second topic, urn occupancy problems, is concerned with the distribution of multiple balls in multiple urns. This classical topic has found applications in many fields. The proposed research concerns large deviation approximations, new techniques for explicitly solving the associated variational problem, and the development of relations between equilibrium distributions for stochastic networks and occupancy problems.<br/><br/>If one were to ask an average person whether unlikely events are important, their first response might be that an event with very little chance of happening could not be significant.  After a moment's reflection, however, they would realize that such events have a profound impact in many circumstances. For example, measuring credit risk is very important to those who manage portfolios of loans, corporate bonds, and other financial instruments that are subject to default risk. Often the problem reduces to estimating the probability of default, which is usually very small, especially for highly rated obligors. However, an accurate estimation is crucial for risk management because these rare defaults can induce significant losses.  Similar considerations apply in many other circumstances, especially when performance standards are stringent.  The dominant technique for estimating small probabilities has been a simulation algorithm called importance sampling. However, the traditional design methodology for importance sampling has very limited applications and has been observed to break down in very common situations. Part of the proposed research is concerned with the most basic question, that is, how to build a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling, upon which efficient algorithms can be designed for very general problems. A new concept of design is introduced in the proposal and the resulting importance sampling algorithms work well in practice. The other part of the proposal is concerned with a class of urn occupancy models. These models are very useful in the design and analysis of large-scale networks, biological systems, and physics. However, due to the complexity of the models, approximation becomes exceedingly important. The proposed research will develop an asymptotic method that can yield good approximations with only a modest computation effort.   <br/>"

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) Pinning and depinning of lattice polymers and interfaces due to potentials existing in lower-dimensional subspaces of the lattice. Particular emphasis will be placed on the disordered case, in which the potential varies randomly with location. Competition between a potential in a subspace and random potentials in the bulk will also be considered. (2) Models in which certain features of the freezing of solutions can be rigorously derived from a local interaction. (3) The Ising model, conditioned, by fixing an excess of the minority spin, so as to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, with emphasis on the critical size of this excess and the width of the droplet-formation ""transition"" as this critical size threshold is crossed. (4) Moving interfaces, e.g. between phases of the Ising model, which may ""hang up"" at locations where a weakened interaction reduces the energetic cost of the interface, resulting in an energy barrier which must be crossed. (5) Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the two-dimensional Potts model and their relation to decay rates of certain probabilities in the FK model. (6) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are opposed to each other. <br/> With regard to intellectual merit, this work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reflect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors; (iv) denaturation of DNA; and (v) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small-scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. Some of the systems, which Alexander will investigate--percolation, random cluster models, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems--are examples of such abstract systems. Other systems, which Alexander will investigate, are somewhat more closely based on specific physical systems, such as polymers, DNA molecules, and solutions."
