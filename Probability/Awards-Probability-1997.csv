The project concentrates on percolation, a mathematical model used to describe   transitions of physical systems. Percolation theory has a variety of applications to solid   physics, biology, computer science, and geology. A percolation process typically depends   on one or more parameters. A dramatic change in physical properties may occur as a   critical parameter value is passed. For example, suppose we immerse a large porous solid   in a bucket water. Clearly, how water penetrates the solid depends on the size of the pores    of the solid. A simple mathematical model of such a process is  defined by taking the pores   to be distributed in some regular manner, and to be open or closed with probabilities p or   1-p. There is a critical threshold, for the probability p at which the behavior changes   abruptly. For values of p below the critical value the water penetration is only superficial   and above  it the penetration is arbitrarily deep. The specific behavior near the critical   threshold is more complicated. One of the most challenging problems is to give a   mathematical description of deep penetration near the critical threshold. The research will   focus on three areas: the behaviors of percolation near the critical threshold, above the   critical threshold and below the critical threshold. In particular, the project will investigate   mathematically rigorous exact solutions for the percolation process. The research makes   use of probability theory, graph theory, combinatorics and function analysis. The project   will use these mathematical tools to advance our rigorous understanding of critical   phenomena."

The proposed research falls into   three parts. Part I deals with degenerate diffusions and their impact on linear partial   differential equations. In their recent work, the investigators have proved a very general   Hormander-type hypoellipticity theorem for second-order linear partial differential   operators. The hypotheses of this theorem allow Hormander's general Lie algebra   condition to fail at an optimal exponential rate on smooth hypersurfaces in Euclidean   space. Such operators have been termed superdegenerate. The investigators will establish   the existence of smooth solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann problems associated with   superdegenerate operators. In Part II, the investigators will study the existence of smooth   densities for a wide class of degenerate stochastic hereditary equations. They will seek to   use their methods to establish hypoellipticity of the corresponding operators. In addition   to solving an infinite-dimensional hypoellipticity problem (apparently the first of its kind),   the estimates obtained here should lead to the  existence of a Lyapunov spectrum in   probability for singular hereditary systems. In Part III, they will use their methods to study   quasilinear second-order partial differential operators with superdegenerate principal parts.   These operators are closely related to superdiffusions. The objective of this part of the   research is to seek classical smooth positive solutions of the quasilinear Cauchy, Dirichlet,   and Neumann problems associated with such operators.   This research deals with two important problem areas that arise in physics and   engineering. The first area concerns an important class of mathematical models, called   partial differential equations, that are fundamental obje cts in modern day pure and applied   mathematics. These equations arose from the study of heat conduction, electrical   potential, and fluid flow. Partial differential equations have important connections with   several areas of mathematics, in particular probability theory and geometry. The second   area is devoted to a class of models that are used in physics, engineering and biology in   order to analyze dynamical systems whose evolution is influenced by random fluctuations   and past history. These models are very important in a variety of diverse areas ranging   from signal processing, stock market fluctuations, economic and labor models, aircraft   dynamics, materials with memory, and population dynamics. The investigators will use the   most current probabilistic techniques in order to develop a deeper understanding of these   models."

The stochastic systems fall into two   model classes: Conservative particle systems, and Brownian trapping models.  The first   category includes the simple exclusion and zero-range systems, while the second category   considers variants of the ""Wiener Sausage"" model.  An important difference between these   two classes lies in that the random environments presented to a particular particle are   ""changing in a comparable scale"" in the first and ""slowly varying"" in the second. Although   the tagged particle fluctuations are well understood with respect to reversible versions of   these models, little is known when these processes possess a drift.  This project focuses on   developing various estimates and limit theorems which do not depend on symmetry, so as   to identify the non-reversible tagged particle fluctuation picture.   Two sample questions which are addressed in this work are: What are the effective   statistics governing the behavior of a typical passenger interacting with other passengers   moving in a complex Customs queue? Consider a thick porous stone roof of a cave; what   is the chance that a rain drop will weave its way through the fissures in the stone to drip   into the cave, and what strategy does it take to avoid being absorbed into the stone?    These two questions fit into the framework of the so-called ""tagged"" particle problem   which is the main subject of this project.  Abstractly, a particle, such as a passenger or a   rain drop, interacts with a random environment.  The goal of this project is to understand   the fluctuation probabilities of this particle interaction in various systems with   asymmetries.  The motivation for this work is that the most general situations in many   physical phenomena of interest, such as fluid flow, queuing, and chemical ion trapping   behavior, are well modeled by these asymmetric p rocesses.  The significance of this   project is that asymmetry is a main feature of the models considered; previously, research   proceeded under the less palatable assumption of symmetry which often simplified the   models beyond application."

The   first, which has applications to partial differential equations, is an investigation into the   squared Laplacian by means of both ordinary Brownian motion and by iterated Brownian   motion. The second area arises out of both economics and physics and is a stochastic   bifurcation model. One has an ordinary differential equation whose behavior is controlled   by a stochastic process. The third area is diffusions on fractals, together with a study of   their properties. These have applications to physics as well as partial differential equations.   Finally, uniqueness for superprocesses will be investigated, resulting in applications to   partial differential equations and to mathematical biology.     Probabilistic techniques will be used to study a number of different models that   arise in economics, physics, and biology.

The first three areas all involve agents controlling stochastic processes either   alone or jointly. Abstract gambling theory is a particular formulation of one-person   stochastic control theory, whereas two-person, zero-sum stochastic games have two   controllers with opposing interests. Strategic market games typically have many agents   and are used to model features of an economy such as price formation and loan markets.   In the fourth area, predictive inference, research is proposed on two criteria that seem   natural to require of any statistical prediction.   Most of the proposed research is on questions of how one or more individuals   should act when faced by a series of successive choices that must be made with   considerable uncertainty about their consequences. An example is the problem of how   much of one's income should be spent on current consumption and how much should be   saved (or invested) for the future. This problem, when formulated for a single individual,   fits into the framework of abstract gambling theory. If two individuals are in direct   competition for resources, the problem can be viewed as a two-person stochastic game.   Finally, if the problem involves all the individuals in a large economy, it can be viewed as a   many-person, strategic market game in which the individuals as a group determine, or at   least influence, prices and interest rates. If a central bank is added to the game as another   player that has the power to set interest rates, the question arises as to how the bank   should set interest rates so as to minimize inflation or improve the general welfare. This is   likely to be a difficult problem for our models just as it is in the real world."

Michael N. Katehakis and Herbert Robbins    Rutgers University    Abstract    This research involves work on adaptive control of dynamic systems.   The basic dynamic model is known as the ""Markov decision process with   incomplete information"" (MDP) problem,  where the transition law   and/or the expected one-period rewards may depend on unknown   parameters.  The most notable results in this area are based on ideas   utilizing either a separation principle and the related   certainty-equivalence rule, or uniformly efficient rules for the   model of  sequential allocation known as the multi-armed bandit   (MAB) problem.  Limitations of the certainty-equivalence rule are:   i)  there is no claim on the rate of convergence, and    ii)  there are cases  for which, with positive probability, this   rule can prematurely converge to a wrong parameter value so that   it eventually uses only a non-optimal policy. The  typical approach  in the latter studies  has been to  fit  the larger MDP model into  the smaller MAB one by considering each deterministic policy as a   reward-generating population (bandit).  A consequence of this is   that the resulting statistically  efficient procedures  involve   sampling from all deterministic policies and do not otherwise   utilize the optimization aspect of the problem. Thus, they become   limited in scope by data collection complexity.  The reason is   that in practice the state spaces of  MDP models tend  to be very  large and the set of deterministic policies is   immense.  In recent work the investigators have obtained adaptive   procedures with data collection requirements that are  proportional   to the number of state - action pairs of the MDP, under a minimal   irreducibility condition. A major direction of the proposed research   involves  the development of solutions for important more general   problems  such as  i) multi-chain MDPs,  ii) the case in which there   a re side constraints, and  iii) discounted streams of rewards.  A   second  important goal is the development of  new adaptive   statistical methods  that possess practically useful implementation   and optimality  properties for the related problems of detection of    total error and change points.      The main idea of adaptive control is to compute strategies (policies,   or control rules) for the operation of  a system that estimate the   unknown parameters of the system, and in doing so converge to a   strategy that is optimal for the true values of the unknown   parameters.  Applications arise in many  areas of  modern engineering,   finance, and operations research, such as reliability, maintenance,  quality control,  scheduling,  inventory, and  production planning.   Consequently, this type of problem has been widely studied in the   literature. However,  effective procedures that take into account and   optimize  the speed of  convergence  have been obtained only recently   for specific models, often, with prohibitive data collection   complexity.  A primary objective of the proposed research is the   development of relatively simple adaptive control procedures with   reasonable computational and memory  requirements for on-line   implementation, for a wide class of problems, utilizing ideas from   recent work of the investigators. Another  important goal is the   development of  new methods for specific models useful in such areas   as software reliability (error detection)  and  quality control   (change points).  This research relates to the following strategic  areas of national concern: high performance computing, communications,  and manufacturing."

Interacting particle systems are continuous time Markov processes on the integer lattice in which each site is in one of several states. Local rules determine the dynamics of the systems. They provide an ideal framework to investigate the role of the spatial structure in models in ecology. In joint work with Dr. Stephen Pacala (Princeton University) the principal investigator will consider the consequences of spatial structure in classical models in ecology, such as the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition. The nonspatial version is very well understood. Including a spatial component will likely yield new phenomena. In joint work with Dr. Stephen Krone (University of Idaho) the principal investigator will study the spread of a population in a heterogeneous environment by using the two-dimensional contact process in a random environment. In theoretical population genetics, Dr. Neuhauser plans to study genealogies under various selection schemes, for instance, frequency-dependent selection and overdominant  selection. It is planned to rigorously derive genealogies and to use them to investigate sample properties in both spatial and nonspatial settings.   The causes and effects of spatial structure have long been central topics in population and community ecology. In joint work with Dr. Stephen Pacala (Princeton University) the principal investigator will study the effects of competition on the spatial structure of communities. Local interactions and competition in spatial communities can cause clumping of individuals of the same species which can lead to a reduction in biodiversity. In joint work with Dr. Stephen Krone (University of Idaho) the principal investigator will consider the spread of populations in heterogeneous environments and how habi tat destruction and subsequent restoration affects the ability of populations to recover. Genealogies are an important tool in population genetics to investigate properties of samples of genes. Dr. Neuhauser plans to investigate frequency-dependent and overdominant selection. Both modes of selection are known to be able to maintain a high degree of genetic diversity. Little is known about genealogies under such selection schemes which are important, for instance, in plant breeding systems or in the major histocompatibility complex."

Specifically, to   find asymptotic distributions of extremal r-scan lengths for several stochastic models,   extending earlier work of the investigators by accommodating dependent and/or   transformed data.

(ii) To provide a   flexible and general framework for characterizing residue clusters and statistical   significance of unusual compositions in protein 3D structures as well as the means of   assessing statistical significance of strong local similarities among two or more such   structures. The proposed framework is based on the study of random models for weighted   labeled graphs and as such it generalizes previous work on the probabilistic foundation of   general score based methods for use in protein sequence comparison.   Since 1995, several prokaryotic genomes and one eukaryotic genome have been   reported, and many are forthcoming. These genomes provide opportunities and pose   challenges for characterizing genomic inhomogeneities, for detecting significant sequence   patterns, and for evolutionary comparisons. Availability of complete genomes and massive   amounts of DNA and protein sequences opens a new era in bioinformatics research.   Advances in (i) and (ii) above can provide much needed tools for biomolecular data   analysis and for comparison of protein sequences and corresponding three-dimensional   structures.  Software approaches are often used to find relationships between newly   discovered sequences and the existing data banks. Similarities detected can be used to   predict biologi cal characteristics of new structures, suggest directions for further   experimental study, and point to possible medical applications. However, due to the   accelerating growth of the data banks, random correlations might at first appear significant   and thus mask the true biological information existing in the data. This research aims at   putting biomolecular data analysis procedures on a firm mathematical foundation, and   concomitantly reducing the masking effect of random correlations."

While the problems concern very different physical situations, at the   mathematical level they all deal with situations where presence of disorder can significantly   change properties of the system. Part one studies ground states of random lattice models   in statistical mechanics---a question related to understanding thermodynamics of   disordered systems.  In part two the focus is on effects of randomness on propagation of   nonlinear waves described by partial differential equations---of the conservation law and   Hamilton-Jacobi type.  The content of part three is statistics of density and of pairwise   velocities of galaxies in the universe. From the point of view of mathematics, each part of   the proposal involves studying nonlinear functions of many independent random variables   or of the realizations of a simple underlying process (often a Gaussian one). This relates   the project thematically to the theory of large deviations and concentration of measure   phenomena.  The tools include functional limit theorems, ergodic theory, large deviation   estimates and martingale methods in the first two parts and generalized Gaussian   processes in the third part. The interplay of physical and mathematical ideas is essential in   the whole proposal.   Many interesting questions in mathematical physics are concerned with   complicated inhomogeneous systems.  For example, a realistic description of a solid often   has to take into account presence of defects and impurities, which make its physical   properties different from those of a homogeneous crystal.  These special properties of   disordered systems are of crucial importance in modern materials science and technology    --- semiconductors and glasses are examples of disordered materials. Another example is   the distribution of galaxies in the Universe --- their positions do not follow any simple   regular pattern and us ing such a pattern in modeling their configuration would not account   for observed phenomena. While detailed configuration (arrangement of atoms, galaxies or   other constituents) of an inhomogeneous system varies from one region in space to   another, there is often an underlying simple statistical regularity, which leads to modeling   and studying such systems using concepts and methods of probability theory.  Each of the   three parts of the proposal addresses a different physical problem of the above type. Part   one involves the study of models of disordered solids, focusing on their ground states ---  the energetically preferred configurations.  Part two is concerned with propagation of   waves in disordered media --- several applications of mathematics to hydrology are of this   type. The content of part three is fluctuations of various quantities related to the   distribution of matter in the Universe and statistical questions arising in interpreting   observational results. The general physical motivation behind the proposal is to understand   possible effects resulting of the presence of randomness in different physical systems."

These are grouped under three headings. (i) Approximation   of multiclass queueing networks in heavy traffic. Most queueing network models cannot   be analyzed exactly and must be approximated by more tractable models. A certain class   of diffusion processes, known as reflecting Brownian motions, have been shown to   approximate heavily loaded single class and some multiclass queueing networks. However,   currently there is no general limit theorem to justify such approximations for heavily   loaded multiclass queueing networks with feedback. Although it is known that such   approximations do not hold in complete generality, the PI seeks to identify broad classes   of multiclass networks for which they do hold and to provide limit theorems to support   such approximations. (ii) Long run behavior of reflecting Brownian motions. For the   purpose of obtaining approximate measures of performance for queueing network models   and as a problem of intrinsic mathematical interest, it is natural to consider the long run   behavior of reflecting Brownian motions. In particular, conditions for positive recurrence   of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions are being sought by study of a related   deterministic dynamical system. (iii) Stochastic differential equations with   discontinuous/degenerate coefficients and applications to nonlinear time series. The need   for nonlinear models in time series analysis has become increasingly apparent in recent   years. Continuous time models can greatly facilitate the analysis of irregularly spaced data.   A useful class of nonlinear continuous time models are the continuous time threshold   autoregressive models. These are defined by stochastic differential equations with a   discontinuous and degenerate diffusion coefficient. A compelling problem for future use of   these models is to resolve the problem of uniqueness for solutio ns of these equations when   the order of the model is larger than two. This problem, as well as multivariate versions of   it, are being studied.  Multidimensional diffusions processes are used as stochastic models in a wide   variety of applications in the physical, biological, engineering and social sciences.   Motivated by such applications, a number of mathematical problems for diffusions are   being studied. As an illustrative example, queueing networks are of current relevance for   analyzing congestion and delay in computer systems, communication networks and   complex manufacturing systems. These networks may process more than one class of   customer or job (e.g., voice, video and data may pass through each node in a   communication network), have complex feedback structures (e.g., as in reentrant lines for   semiconductor wafer fabrication) and are frequently heavily loaded. In general such   models cannot be analyzed exactly and one is naturally led to seek tractable   approximations, such as multidimensional diffusions. A challenging mathematical question   here is when is such an approximation valid? Results of recent years have revealed this to   be a complex issue for multiclass networks with feedback. This question and others for   multidimensional diffusions are being pursued under this grant."

These include 1)   applications of martingale inequalities to investigate the  operator  norm of the Beurling-  Ahlfors operators in two and several dimensions, 2) the use of Brownian motions to   investigate sharp bounds for the fundamental frequency and fundamental gap of the   Laplacian in Euclidean domains, and 3) the use of asymptotic expansions for Wiener   functionals to investigate the asymptotic expansion in the trace of Schrodinger operators   and  how the signs of the coefficients in such  expansion depend on the sign of the   potential.    Probability Theory has its roots in various fields of applied sciences and hence it should   not be surprising that modern stochastic analysis draws many of its technical tools from   several distinct areas of mathematics.  What is often far from  obvious  is that probabilistic   ideas and techniques can be effectively used to investigate problems and applications   which on the surface do not seem to be related to probability at all. The problems   discussed above fall in this category.  The Beurling-Ahlfors operators are (singular)    integral operators which describe regularity (smoothness) properties of solutions to   various nonlinear  equations arising from, among other topics, elasticity.  The computation   of their operator norms is a fundamental problem with many applications.  On the surface   this operator  appears to be very far from probability.  The Principal Investigator, in   collaboration with G. Wang and A. J. Lindeman, has successfully used the theory of   martingales (fair games) to study this problem.  The first part of the project describes   various new probabilistic approaches for further work in this direction.  Bounds  on the   fundamental frequency and fundament al gap of the Laplacian operator are basic quantities   in the theory of vibrating membranes. The trace of Schrodinger operators plays a   fundamental role in  various problems in mathematical physics related to, among other   things, scattering theory. Here, too, the connection to probability is not transparent. In the   second part of the project the PI proposes to use the theory of Brownian motion and   stochastic calculus to investigate several open problems in this areas. It is expected that   these investigations will lead, as it has happened many times in the past, to new and   surprising applications of probability to analysis, geometry, partial differential equations,   and the application of these subjects to mathematical physics. Several students will most   likely participate in these investigations."

The models under study, path and loop spaces over such geometric structures such   as spheres, ellipsoids, and tori, have been used extensively in recent years in the theory of   relativity, quantum physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The Principal Investigator will   study these models by both traditional analytical methods and the more recent methods of   probability theory.

In this research, several   questions are studied in connection with strongly mixing random sequences, and   connections with random fields are discussed briefly.  Question 1 deals with a possible   ``trichotomy'' for the asymptotic behavior of the partial sums from a strictly stationary,   strongly mixing sequence of random variables taking their values in a Banach space.    Question 2 deals with the exact location of a part of the ``borderline'' of the central limit   theorem under the (Rosenblatt) strong mixing condition.  Question 3 deals with the   spectral density of random sequences under a certain strong mixing condition.  Question 4   deals with a possible connection (or lack of one) between two strong mixing conditions;   the relevance of this question to an old conjecture of I.A. Ibragimov is discussed.   In the real world, there are many phenomena which appear to be ``weakly   dependent,'' in the sense that observations that are ``close'' in time or location may have   considerable influence on each other, while observations that are ``far apart'' in time or   location have only slight influence on each other.  For example, the annual unemployment   rate for the year 1998 may have considerable influence on the unemployment rates for the   years 1999 and 2000, but will presumably have almost no influence on the employment   rate in, say, the year 2050. Similarly, the fluctuations in the wind currents at a given   location may be highly correlated with the (wind current) fluctuations ten miles away, but   perhaps have no discernible correlation with the fluctuations 3000 miles away.  For the   modeling of such phenomena, much attention has been devoted in probability theory to a   broad type of weak dependence known under the name ``stron g mixing conditions.'' An   understanding of ``structural'' properties of strong mixing conditions can help in assessing   their appropriateness for the modeling of a given real world phenomenon, and ``laws of   averages'' connected with such conditions can provide the foundation for the statistical   inference for the given phenomenon.  This research deals with several questions   concerning both ``structural'' properties and ``laws of averages'' in connection with various   strong mixing conditions."

It   deals with optimal control of diffusion processes by means of a free   boundary as well as optimal control at a reflection boundary of the   stochastic process.  This type of control naturally appears in the problems in   which there is no natural restriction on the rates of control and the optimal   control rates are infinite. (This type of control model serves also as a good   approximation for the situations when the rates are bounded but very large.)    The optimal policy is then to reflect the process from an a priori unknown   boundary. Natural models where such type of action arises are related to the    problems with additive input, where there are no a priori limits on the   control rates or as an approximation for the problems with optimal policy of   a ""bang-bang"" type. The proposed research consists of developing the   theory of the related PDE with gradient constraints, studying optimal   reflecting barriers in multidimensional cases, and applying the results to   different mechanical, manufacturing and financial models.    This research should provide a sound theoretical base for developing   optimal control algorithms for an automatic cruise control of a missile    subject to uncertain wind conditions or a space vehicle subject to small   perturbations in mechanical units. The developed technique will enable one   to calculate the position when the maximal correction force should be   applied as well as the optimal direction of this force. At the ""ground level""   this theory will give a tool to derive optimal inventory levels for complex   flexible manufacturing systems as well as optimal timings for changes in   the  manufacturing processes. In the financial world this theory will provide   a method for finding optimal levels of funds for financial companies whose   assets are subject to random fluctuations. For example, in the case of a large   insurance company whose liquid assets  are constantly fluctuating due to   uncertainty in the times and amounts of incoming claims, it will be  possible   to calculate the optimal level of the reserve which should be maintained in   order to have the optimal balance between the risk and profit potential."

The PI plans to investigate the following   problems.  It has been shown in some examples that a stochastic flow may be decomposed   as an asymptotically deterministic flow followed by a random ""rotation"". The PI plans to   look into the possibility that some general type of stochastic flows possess this kind of   decomposition. If this is understood, then a theory of random sources and sinks can be   developed for stochastic flows. It has been established for stochastic flows contained in   finite dimensional Lie transformation groups that the limiting stability of stochastic flows is   completely determined by the structure of the group. The PI plans to investigate to what   extent this holds for general infinite dimensional stochastic flows.   The dymanical theory studies the motion of a system, whether this is a mechanical,   a biological or an environmental system. An important question is whether the system is   stable or what kind of long time behavior the system exhibits. The stochastic flows provide   models for systems whose motions depend on some random elements. Although one may   not be able to predict with certainty the path of a random system, the study of stochastic   flows enables one to project the long time behavior or pattern of the system with   confidence. The proposal is concerned with some basic problems in the dynamical theory   of stochastic flows."

Another project is concerned with   the large deviation behavior of the random resistor network. In Ising and random cluster   models the investigator intends to study the rigidity (roughness) of certain phase   boundaries.

The aim of this project is to study certain geometric aspects of random spatial   systems. In some random systems geometric objects (in this case surfaces) which are   deterministic on a macroscopic scale arise naturally.

The first   project investigates the following three related topics:  (i)  the  scaling limit of  tagged   particles, (ii) the equilibrium fluctuation and  (iii) the appropriate time scale for dimensions   1 and 2.  The first problem emphasizes the  individual behavior of a typical particle instead   of the collective behavior of all the particles. The second problem is a question about the  central limit theorem. The third problem addresses  the time scale  in dimensions 1 and  2,   which is conjectured  to be very different from the diffusive scale in dimension 3. The   second project  studies the relaxation  rates of the Kawasaki dynamics of  Gibbs states in   infinite volume. This is believed to be  a power law. The method is  based on the Poincare   inequalities (spectral gap), logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and some entropy estimates.   The third project concerns the scaling limit of a quantum particle in a random potential.   There are two limiting cases: the low density  limit and the weak coupling limit. In both   cases, the phase space density of the quantum evolution  defined through  the Wigner   transform or the coherent state is expected to converge weakly to  a linear  Boltzmann   equation with  collision kernel given by the quantum   scattering  cross section.   This research addresses in particular the following two questions: (1) What is the   typical behavior of an individual particle in a fluid? Though the collective behavior of fluid    has been studied intensively, the important  question of the propagation of individual    particles in the fluid has not. The project will study this question with stochastic models   which are believed to capture the essential behavior of  the fluid.  (2) How does a wave   travel in random media. It is believed that  with high disorder, a wave in random media    becomes loca lized. The important question is to analyze the low disorder region when a   wave propagates. This can be considered as a model for conduction  of current in a   semiconductor, or propagation of radio waves or seismic waves. The practical  equation   governing all these diverse phenomena  is the  Boltzmann equation. This study will try to   validate the Boltzmann equation from more basic models involving  wave equations in   random media and to understand its next order corrections or fluctuations."

It includes non-logarithmic large deviation probabilities for partial sums of independent random vectors via dominating points in the infinite dimensional setting, and also the application of these results to a Gibbs conditioning principle for certain infinite dimensional statistics. Limit sets for random samples of processes, as well as related coverage problems will be examined, and a primary focus will be to further examine the link between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems in approximation theory.  For Gaussian measures, this linkage has been useful in a number of problem areas, but a more detailed examination from several points of view is proposed. Problems concerning vector valued partial sums, empirical processes, self-normalized partial sums, and limit theorems for convex hulls for Brownian motion are also to be considered.  Applications of probability in modern science frequently involve the study of random quantities with many components (dimensions), or perhaps even of a geometric nature. Thus they require probability estimates and limit theorems which are applicable to random sets, or which are dimension free (hence, in essence, infinite dimensional). A major theme in the investigator's previous work and in much of the currently proposed research addresses both of these issues in a variety of settings. As a first example consider the link between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems, which showed certain probability estimates are equivalent to problems in approximation theory. This link led to the solution of a long standing problem in approximation theory, and portions of the proposed research involve important unsolved analogues of this problem. Another example is the study of the Gibbs conditioning principle of statistical mechanics for statistics with infinitely many components. To begin to handle this type of problem one needs non-logarithmic estimat es of large deviation probabilities which are dimension free.  Such estimates were obtained recently, and their application to Gibbs conditioning is being initiated. Additional problems exhibiting these general features are also to be considered, and connect with classical geometry, analysis, and statistics."

The sampled vectors making up the first class are independent, each a linear transformation of a vector containing i.i.d. elements, while the second class models the result of perturbing a sample covariance (or correlation) matrix with noise added to each sampled vector.  For the latter case independence is not assumed on the unperturbed samples.  Although both classes have a broad range of applicability, motivation for studying them comes from the detection problem in array signal processing, when the number of (unknown) sources, impinging on a bank of sensors in a noise-filled environment, is sizable.  For both classes the empirical distribution function (e.d.f.) of the eigenvalues (as the dimension approaches infinity) converges to a nonrandom limit.  Using techniques and arguments recently developed to successfully analyze the convergence of individual eigenvalues of the first class to boundary points in the limiting support, the principal investigator plans to solve two remaining open problems concerning this class, namely the rate of convergence of both the e.d.f. and those individual eigenvalues, and relaxing independence assumptions.  He also intends to study completely the analogous properties of the second class of matrices, beginning with understanding analytically the limiting e.d.f., which is described in terms of an equation satisfied by its Stieltjes transform.    The principal investigator plans to study properties of two classes of random matrices of high dimension used in modeling multivariate random phenomena.  The motivation stems primarily from the detection problem in array signal processing, that is, determining the number of sources impinging on a bank of sensors in the presence of noise.  Under certain conditions, when  the number of sources is sizable, known results on one of the classes of random matrices can be used to reliably estimate the number of sources with the total number of measurements much smaller than what is needed according to standard multivariate analysis.  The principal investigator intends to study a few remaining questions pertaining to this class, and to mathematically analyze another class of random matrices which allows for a broader range of applications."

Heavy tailed modeling frequently implies infinite variances and thus departs from Gaussian methods. Broad themes of the research program include parameter estimation and prediction in heavy tailed models, model selection and confirmation, and the interplay between long range dependence and heavy tails. Special attention is given to application areas which include the financial and commodities markets and teletraffic networks such as the World Wide Web.  Both probabilistic modeling and statistical issues are emphasized.  Statistical issues include coping with changes of methods implied by non-standard data features such as long range dependence, lack of existence of moments and correlations, and dependencies which cannot be captured by linear structures.  Probabilistic models will be formulated and studied in an attempt to qualitatively explain observed features of the data.    The increasing instrumentation of both financial markets and broadband data networks makes possible the collection of huge quantities of data.  Examination of some of the data reveals features that classical statistics and probability models are not used to dealing with and hence, this project has a dual purpose:  (a) To develop statistical tools which use the data to more reliably fit models and make predictions; (b) To build probability models which provide qualitative insights into the nature of the system under investigation.  For example, modern broadband networks exhibit characteristics much different from what is predicted by classical models.  A question which may be answered by this research is, ""when is it economically advisable to add service capacity to the network?""."

The main difference from the traditional approach for N diffusing particles is that the   fluctuations will be represented by ""correlated"" Brownian motions (representing the   fluctuation forces), where the strength of the correlations depends on the distance of  two   given particles and a parameter, the so-called correlation length. Consequently, the SPDEs   will depend on the correlation length as a parameter. Macroscopic and central limit   theorems are expected, as the correlation length tends to zero. Further, the investigator   will study the qualitative properties of the SPDEs. Homogeneous, isotropic and stationary   random fields shall be derived as solutions of the SPDEs, and the spectral analysis of the   random fields in terms of the coefficients of the SPDEs shall be conducted.   Mathematically, the proposed work will build a bridge between 4 different areas of   mathematics, namely particle systems, SPDEs, random fields and partial differential   equations.   Many physical, biological and economic phenomena consist of a large number of   components. The large number and the rapid changes of the components make an exact   description of the time evolution of all components very difficult , if not impossible.   Examples are turbulence, chemical reactions, diffusion, spreading of diseases (viruses,   bacteria), population growth, environmental pollution, climate, weather, financial markets   etc. To build a mathematical model of those phenomena, the real world systems of atoms,   molecules, viruses etc. are replaced by random particle systems whose time evolution can   serve as a good predictor for  the real world systems. A more traditional model for the   same phenomena are macroscopic (deterministic) partial differential equations, many of   which, more than  a century ago, became the ma in theoretical tools in different areas of   physics and engineering and also, more recently, in some areas of the biosciences and   economics. Such an equation typically describes ""how much mass (of some matter) is at a   given place at a given time."" Mathematically, most of those macroscopic equations can be   derived from particle systems by a limit procedure, assuming that the number of particles   becomes infinite and their respective masses become very small, and that the motion of   particles is always statistically uncorrelated. This derivation also explains why the   macroscopic equations often do not correctly predict the time evolution of the real world   systems, but that in the long run they appear to be an average of many observations.   Macroscopic equations, however,  are easier to compute than particle systems. The   investigator will extend the model of macroscopic partial differential equations to a model   of  mezoscopic (stochastic) partial differential equations. The mezoscopic equations shall   be derived from particle systems in the same way as the macroscopic equations, but under   more realistic assumptions on the particle systems, namely that the motion of particles is   statistically correlated, when they are close to one another.  As a result the mezoscopic   equations should be in better agreement with observations than the macroscopic   equations, while preserving the computational simplicity of the latter ones. Moreover, the   macroscopic equations will appear as the  limiting case of the mezoscopic equations.   Mezoscopic equations will have diverse applications in physical chemistry, the biosciences,   fluid mechanics and financial markets."

To accomplish this goal, he proposes to develop new connections between the theory of stochastic processes and ergodic theory, group representations, particularly those induced in the sense of Mackey, and functional analysis.  These general results can be applied in the structural analysis of stationary, self-similar, and isotropic infinitely divisible random fields.  He also intends to continue research on asymptotic independence of stochastic processes, sample path continuity, and multiple stochastic integrals.    Infinitely divisible random processes appear naturally in many areas of theoretical and applied probability, communications, networking, mathematical finance, and statistics.  Roughly speaking, a process is infinitely divisible if its behavior is determined by a large number of mutually independent random factors. Stationarity is a notion describing statistical symmetries of a random process.  Stationary infinitely divisible processes, which may exhibit high variability, are not well understood at present because the traditional methodology of Gaussian processes is not applicable here.

The solution to the Skorokhod Problem defines what   might be considered the input/output map for a number of exact and approximate models   in   queueing, communication, economics, and other areas. Except in special cases, little is   known about the analytical properties of this mapping. This research will build on prior   work of the investigator and H. Ishii which takes a geometric approach to obtaining   regularity conditions for the Skorokhod Problem. The main thrust of the present work is   the   development and application of methods based on convex duality.  The second part of the   project studies large deviations for queueing networks. The main topic here is the   formulation and analysis of risk sensitive criteria for the control and regulation of queueing   networks. In almost all models for networks there are errors, approximations, and model   uncertainty, and one would like to design control schemes that are insensitive to such   errors. Using the duality between exponential integrals and the relative entropy function,   one can (at least in the context of diffusions) give a precise quantitative characterization of   the  additional robustness properties that are obtained when a risk sensitive criteria is used.   The investigator will formulate and analyze via large deviation techniques such criteria in a   queueing context. The final part of the project considers cmmputational methods for   deterministic optimal control problems. The main emphasis here is on the development of   practical algorithms with good qualitative properties. This will be done for a class of   problems with very similar features that arise in large deviation for diffusions, certain   problems fr om computer vision, and robust nonlinear control and robust filtering.   Modern communication, computer, and queueing systems are very complicated,   and   in fact too complicated to analyze in complete detail. As systems become more and more   heterogeneous (e.g., different data classes, different quality of service requirements, etc.)   the control and regulation of these systems becomes more difficult and less intuitive. The   first two parts of this project investigate two approaches to dealing with such systems.   When analyzing queueing and communication systems one needs (relatively) simple   system   models which capture the most important aspects of the true system. Linear systems are   unable to capture the system behavior caused by hard constraints (non-negativity of queue   lengths, limits on buffer sizes, etc.) and discontinuities that occur naturally in well   designed   routing and service protocols. Part of this research is to look at alternatives to linear   systems. The second part focuses on the study of risk sensitive criteria for such systems.   Risk sensitive and robust criteria provide alternatives to traditional criteria for the   evaluation of system performance, and it is now understood that they are very useful in   situations where model uncertainty and robustness against modeling errors are important.   Such robustness properties are always important for communication and manufacturing   systems. The aim here is to properly formulate and analyze risk-sensitive criteria for   random   networks, and to quantify the robustness properties when compared to traditional criteria.   The last part of the project is devoted to the development of usable and efficient   computational methods for deterministic optimal control problems, and in particular to the   class of problems that arise in the second part of the proposal."

The present project   continues the study of these relations and their applications. Sheth's model for   gravitational clustering of galaxies leads to problems related to the additive coalescent in   which each pair of sets in a partition of a finite set is merging at a rate which is the sum of   the sizes of the two sets. Asymptotics of this additive coalescent define a discrete measure   valued process which can be constructed by cutting Aldous's continuum random tree at   points of a suitable Poisson process. It is proposed to study this and other measure-valued   Markov processes which model coalescent phenomena, and to look for novel applications   of these processes.     Brownian motion provides the doundation of the modern theory of continuous time   random processes with continuous paths, and has applications in fields as diverse as   physics and mathematical finance. Random partitions find applications to combinatorics,   physics and genetics. Statistical models for physical processes of coalescence and   fragmentation are of interest in a number of fields. The evolution of a partition of particles   into clumps can be variously interpreted, for example, as a partition of atoms into   molecules, a partition of molecules into polymers, or a partition of stars into galaxies. In a   chemical setting, atoms coalesce to form molecules, and molecules coalesce to form   polymers. In a cosmological setting, stars coalesce to form galaxies.

Members of the first class of processes describe the clustering as time passes of a collection of masses by a random sequence of binary collisions.  Known construction results are extended to new collision mechanisms and more general initial mass configurations.  Asymptotic behavior is studied in various limiting regimes.  Members of the second class of processes are space-time rescaling limits of a variety of spatial processes such as stepping-stone models and long range voter models, and are defined to be ""dual"" to the labeled partition process induced by a system of coalescing Markov processes.  Several questions concerning the sample path properties of such models are investigated.   The Principal Investigator will study two mathematical models involving coalescence of particles.  Models in the first class have been applied to chemical phenomena such as polymerisation and  physical phenomena of coagulation and condensation such as the evolution of galactic clusters by gravitational attraction.  There are also connections with questions considered in the construction of data bases.  The proposed research deals particularly with understanding what happens when one considers systems with extremely large numbers of coalescing objects, as is usually the case in applications.

Perhaps the most celebrated problem in this context is the derivation of the   hydrodynamic and kinetic equations from small scale dynamics governed by the Newton's   second law. This problem is still wide open but some variants have been recently treated.   The investigator's research concerns the analysis of particle systems modeling fluids and   gas. Recently the investigator in collaboration with James Tarver has derived a Boltzmann   type equation for the macroscopic particle densities of a class stochastic particle systems   modeling dilute gases. Roughly speaking one shows that after a suitable scaling the   microscopic particle density converges to a solution of a Boltzmann type equation. The   investigator also shows that the convergence is exponentially fast and derives an explicit   expression for the exponential rate of convergence. This result allows us to go beyond the   macroscopic description given by the Boltzmann equation and obtain some valuable   insight about the microscopic structure of the particle system under study.   Our world appears differently at different scales. For example a fluid or a gas is a   collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move   erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize   themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale? Roughly the reason is   that the local conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy impose constraints not   immediately visible on the microscopic scale. The investigator's research concerns the   relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids and   gases. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting   particles has proved to be useful in understanding  the intricate behavior of fluids and   gases. Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient way of   simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases."

Such processes describe configurations on lattices which evolve by a repeated update of a local rule.  The research goals consist of three main parts.  The first part focuses on deterministic and random growth models, emphasizing emergence of asymptotic shapes, limit laws for first passage times, as well as hydrodynamic and other continuum limits.  The second part is devoted to competition theory, especially to cases which lead to approximation with the motion by mean curvature.  On finite universes, long-time evolution of such dynamics depends on topological properties of the underlying space.  The third part consists of studying percolation on hypercubes in high dimensions; the goal is to understand how the number of species is determined by the structure of viable genotypes and various mating strategies.  This research is accompanied by development of computer software, which is used for simulation, statistical analyses, numerical computation and combinatorial searches.    This project studies several classes of deterministic and random evolutions of spatial configurations.  The basic property of these evolutions is that they are governed by local rules; they are referred to as deterministic and random cellular automata (CA).  The study of CA offers insights into fundamental organizational principles in many scientific contexts. CA complement differential equations, the prevailing method of describing physical processes, by demonstrating how differential equations arise naturally from local rules.  In biological contexts, the CA models under study shed light on how harshness of the environment affects diversity of species, how equally fit species compete for the available space and how spread of biological agents is affected by spatial anomalies.  Emergence of shapes in growth models is often seen as the basic example of global structure arising from local dynamics, and studying proper ties of such shapes leads to challenges in probability theory, geometry and complexity theory.  Finally, computer analyses of CA are not only indispensable for mathematical development, but they also provide a worthy testing ground for parallel computation schemes and visualization hardware."

He proposes to work (partly with Tom Liggett) to try to extend work of theirs (and others) on contact processes on trees: to prove a conjecture of Liggett which would complete a significant characterization of the three phases of the process on a homogeneous tree; to understand more fully the behavior in the three phases; and to use this detailed knowledge of the behavior to complete work with Robin Pemantle in which certain exponentially growing non-homogeneous trees are found where the branching random walk and/or the contact process only have one phase transition.  Alan Stacey also proposes to extend methods developed by van den Berg to show almost sure uniqueness of the Gibbs measure of a two-dimensional spin-glass model at parameter values where the Gibbs measure for the corresponding Ising model is not unique.  He proposes to work on problems in percolation such as trying to prove that percolation occurs in certain models where this is not known for any non-trivial value of the parameters, including a percolation model with long-range dependencies which arises from a question about random walks on a graph; a more ambitious project (in the light of the unsuccessful attempts by many distinguished probabilists) is to show that the percolation probability at the critical value is zero for standard bond percolation in three dimensions.  Stacey also proposes to work on an appealing conjecture that the rates of convergence are the same for two different Markov chains arising from a card-shuffling situation.    The problems described concern mathematical models for important physical and biological processes such as the spread of disease and the growth of populations (both human, and those consisting of other organisms).  Although the mathematical descriptions are abstract and are not typically based on one specific real-world situation, a detailed understandi ng of the abstract models helps one to understand and predict important physical model; indeed, one or two simply described mathematical models can be of relevance to a very large number of physical systems.  One key phenomenon common to the abstract models and the empirical observations is phase transitions: a system can exhibit two or more quite different types of behavior (or phases) under different conditions; a classic example is that of a disease which may spread out of control under certain conditions and fizzle out under different circumstances.  The change from one phase to another is often quite dramatic and can be the result of a very small change in the parameters on which the system depends, such as the susceptibility of the individuals in a population or (in another classic example of phase transition -- that of a substance turning from a solid to a liquid) the temperature. The work proposed explores the nature of the phase transition and the types of phases that can occur in a number of different models.  They include the contact process --  a model for the spread of disease --  which can exhibit two phases in certain environments, and three phases in others; and spin glasses -- which model magnetism in a substance with impurities -- where, in a certain case, it is thought that no phase transition exists and the system has similar behavior at all temperatures; but this conjecture is not yet proven."

In this case it is of interest to know which   initial configurations converge to which stationary distributions.  For the contact process   the complete convergence theorem provides the perfect answer to the above question.   This solution may be carried over to a large class of supercritical, attractive, reversible   nearest particle systems.  Such a complete convergence theorem cannot hold for the   critical reversible nearest particle systems as finite systems die out almost surely.    Mountford is interested in examining the above question in this case. The convergence   question for the voter model is well understood and a good description of the stationary   distributions is given, but it remains difficult to address large deviation and percolation   issues. Mountford wishes to investigate these and similar questions. Mountford will also   continue his work on the structure of level sets for the Brownian sheet, in collaboration   with Professor Robert Dalang.   Professor Mountford is continuing his work on interacting particle systems.    Interacting particle systems are processes where a large (often infinite) population have   associated variables that evolve in random fashion; a particular individual's variable will   typically evolve according to its value and those of its close neighbors.  For instance the   population may be trees in an orchard, the variable values may be sick or healthy and an   individuals value may change from sick to healthy or vice-versa depending on the health   and sickness values of the immediately surrounding trees.  These processes provide a rich   family of models for the spread of disease, the propagation of knowledge, the   establishment of consensus. The subject of interacting particle systems for infinite   populations becomes particularly interesting when the system admits distinct equilibria.   The n one important issue is to say which (if any) equilibrium a system will converge to,   when starting from a given initial configuration. Another important area of research is to   describe the distinct equilibria.  If the population is large but finite, then although usually   there is only one equilibrium, multiple equilibria in the corresponding infinite population   translate into the existence of initial configurations for the finite system that take a very   long time to reach equilibrium."

The main objects of interest in this proposal are the ergodic behavior and the relaxation patterns of several interacting particle systems, including Ising models and other lattice spin systems, contact processes on arbitrary graphs, growth models and cellular automata.  Several of the proposed problems have their motivation in phenomena observed in nature as, for example, metastable states of systems in the vicinity of phase transition regions.   The Principal Investigator will study problems in interacting particle systems.  These are models for systems which contain a large number of  similar components and in which each component interacts in a simple way with a few other ones.  For instance one can think of the atoms in a crystal interacting when they are close enough, or individuals in a large population which may suffer or not from some infection with contamination occurring between neighbors.  The local interaction may involve a substantial amount of randomness, but since the system as a whole is large, one expects and indeed observes a much more predictable behavior at the global level.  A great deal of interest in such   systems stems from the fact that the qualitative behavior of the whole system may depend in non-trivial ways on parameters which are built into the local interactions, but which only affect those in a smooth way (for example, the rate of infection between neighboring individuals in the second example above).  The general issues of interest are then the understanding of which sort of equilibria can be reached by such types of stochastic dynamics, how an equilibrium state is reached, and how the parameters which affect the local rules may affect the answers to these questions."

The contact process   on a homogeneous tree has two critical values, and hence three distinct parameter regions   of interest.  The most important from the point of view of this project is the middle one, in   which there is weak survival.  In this region, it is proposed to extend Liggett's earlier   construction of radially symmetric stationary distributions, and more generally, to   investigate the structure of the set of all extremal stationary distributions.  One approach   to this proceeds via a conjecture made by him concerning the size of a certain growth   parameter.  Another problem is to determine the asymptotics of the larger critical value as   the coordination number of the tree increases.  Finally, there is the issue of how long it   takes for the contact process on a finite part of the tree to die out, and how this depends   on the parameter value.  The exclusion process to be considered is one dimensional and   asymmetric, and homogeneous except for one bond, which is slower than the others.  The   problem is to determine the effect of this slow bond on the structure of the set of   stationary distributions.  The problems for voter models and reaction diffusion processes   deal with regions of ergodicity and nonergodicity.     A significant number of areas of physics and biology involve situations in which a large number of agents evolve in time in such a way that the evolution of each agent is affected by the states of the others.  The agents could be atoms in a crystal, or parasites in a host population, for example.  In many of these situations, there is some quantity (temperature, say) which affects the way in which the interaction occurs, and in many cases, the evolution of the system is changed drastically when this quantity changes by a small amount.  The area known as interacting particle systems is the branch o f probability theory that studies such issues.  The models to be studied in this project are among the more important which arise in this area. The contact process is related to spread of infection, exclusion processes model particle motion, voter models have a socio-political   interpretation, and reaction diffusion processes model systems in which growth and   motion both occur.  Stationary distributions are descriptions of the possible long time   states of a system.  A main issue for each class of models is to determine what these are,   and how their structure depends on the quantity which specifies the strength of the   interaction."

It consists of the following: (a) deriving representation formulas for new classes of processes, including jump Markov processes; (b) proving the Laplace principle for diffusions and other processes having discontinuous statistics with various geometries; (c) proving the Laplace principle for a random walk model with state- dependent noise; (d) proving the Laplace principle for empirical measures of Markov chains and related processes, including measure-valued processes with state dependencies; (e) generalizing a new formula on the Legendre-Fenchel transform of compositions of convex functions. Research in area (2) consists of the following: (a) using a new representation formula for large deviation probabilities together with weak convergence methods to obtain an explicit formula for the rate function for a number of queueing models of interest; (b) extending a recent paper on the large deviation analysis of general queueing systems to other queueing models, including state-dependent queues; (c) evaluating the exact large deviation rates and determining the overflow paths corresponding to certain overflow events in a number of queueing networks. This research program in large deviations is motivated by applications to queueing networks, which are of fundamental importance in communication and high performance computing. The work of the Principal Investigator over the past few years, which culminated in a number of important papers and a research-level book, develops a set of new and powerful techniques for studying the behavior of such networks. For example, a critical problem in the design of high speed networking technologies is to size the buffe rs at communications switches within these networks so that certain overflow probabilities are suitably small. Another critical problem in the design of very large multiprocessor systems is to estimate the probability that the system will fail in some time interval. This research will be adapted to studying these and related problems."
