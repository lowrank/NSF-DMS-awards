In many such processes, the key to understanding this macroscopic order is a careful analysis of the random motions of individual particles (or bits of information) in the network. In turn, understanding the random motions of particles in inhomogeneous networks often requires analysis of the corresponding motions in homogeneous networks. A major goal of this research is to construct a comprehensive picture of how random walkers behave in infinite homogeneous networks with tree-like, or ""hyperbolic'' geometry. A secondary goal is to determine the behavior of a number of specific models of epidemic and information-propagation models in such networks. Some of the research topics will involve graduate students, who will benefit from exposure to these cutting-edge problems in mathematical probability theory and their motivating application areas.<br/><br/>The project aims to settle a number of important open technical questions concerning the long-time behavior of random walks on lattices of semi-simple Lie groups and other nonamenable discrete groups. These center on ""local limit"" behavior: for which groups do random walks with arbitrary, but finitely supported, step distributions obey a universal local limit law? Related questions concern the structure of the Martin boundaries for such random walks, the support of the exit measure, and the geometry of long random loops. The project will also devote some effort to the study of SIR epidemics, with the particular object of describing critical scaling behavior."

The CLT's main conclusion is that aggregated data follows the so-called Gaussian law, also known as the normal or ""bell"" curve. But scientists in many fields from seismology to computer science to quantitative finance are finding that their data series have long-range correlations, which means that the CLT may or may not be a valid way of looking at how such data aggregates. The PI's work on correlated data sequences, and related questions, would show that the Gaussian-law behavior afforded by the CLT persists up to very long correlation lengths, with some quantitative differences with the standard CLT, such as an increase in how spread out averages tend to get. For instance, one of the PI's theoretical conjectures is that if correlation is long enough, it would take too much data in practice to be able to observe a CLT-type aggregation. The PI will study the effect of even longer-range correlations, showing that instead of bell-curve behavior, data could involve much higher levels of uncertainty (a.k.a. heavy tails), with an extremely slow rate of aggregation. This could be of some significance when applied to financial risk in the housing market: tools could be developed for sellers of institutional mortgage insurance products for highly correlated mortgages; they would help avoid errors in risk calculations, such as those made by the American International Group (AIG) in the years preceding the world financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in a taxpayer-funded bailout upwards of $ 180 billion. The PI also plans to study the implications of long-range correlations in so-called spin models which are useful in the physics of random media, where, unlike the example of mortgage-based financial derivatives, long-range correlations and heavy tails could have little or no influence on the average large-scale behavior. The PI's Ph.D. students will take part in both theoretical and applied aspects of the research, working with the PI to prove theorems and test their results in practice using numerics. Involving students in fundamental research with real-world applications will broadly disseminate scientific understanding. The PI systematically encourages students from underrepresented groups to join the research program.<br/><br/>   The PI proposes a three-year research program in stochastic analysis, with two groups of topics. First, the complexity of asymptotic laws for variations of Gaussian processes with long-range correlations will be evidenced by searching for conditions implying normal, non-normal, and conditionally normal limits in general situations, including sharp convergence rates. Second, the PI will analyze densities, tails, and convex functionals, spin systems, and hitting probabilities, for general Malliavin-differentiable non-Gaussian processes and fields. A main set of tools is the new use of the Malliavin calculus for quantitative estimates of various distances between laws of random variables on Wiener space. This includes the PI's formula for the density of general random variables on Wiener space, proved with I. Nourdin in 2009. Another tool is the PI's comparison of convex functionals for random vectors and fields on Wiener space, proved in 2013 with I. Nourdin and G. Peccati. Yet another is the first sharp estimates of distances to the normal law on Wiener space, proved in 2012 and 2013 by Bierme, Bonami, Nourdin, and Peccati. The PI will forego power-scale model assumptions such as self-similarity and/or stationarity whenever possible, using instead assumptions which are intrinsic to general covariance structures. One of the consequence of the work will be to show that well-known behaviors in so-called critical cases for power variations can be artefacts of the chosen model classes. Another will be to find out the extend of the so-called Sherrington-Kirkpatrick universality class for spin systems in random media, and to determine behaviors when heavy tails and long-range correlations cause spin systems to exit this class. A third consequence should be to understand the critical cases for hitting probabilities of fractional Brownian motion."

The project aims to develop probabilistic, analytic, and geometric tools that will lead to a deeper understanding of physically-relevant random fields.  It is anticipated that these tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of long-standing open problems in the theory of SPDE and related random fields, and further promote their applicability. The project involves graduate students in the research.<br/><br/>It is significant and challenging to characterize the fine local and asymptotic structures of SPDE and related random fields.  In past work, the investigators developed ideas, based in geometric-measure theory, for the analysis of non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields, and they introduced renewal-theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of nonlinear SPDE. This research project continues investigation of precise quantitative connections between random fields, potential theory, SPDE, and the geometry of random fractals. Special emphasis is placed on two extremal universality classes of SPDE that are driven by fully non-linear multiplicative noise.  Further pursuit of these connections is expected to yield novel insights into the structure of random fields, physical multifractals, and related SPDE."

This award supports travel to the conference by students and early career mathematicians from the United States. This conference is part of a series of annual conferences devoted to the area of permutation patterns. Ever since the first conference in 2003, which was hosted by the University of Otago in New Zealand, it has been held every year at different institutions around the world: in North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. About 70 participants are anticipated, with about 35-40 contributed talks with no parallel sessions. The conference has been publicized through distribution lists, AMS and other mathematical event calendars, and related conference websites (the conference website is at https://permutationpatterns2016.wordpress.com). <br/><br/>The conference will feature current research in the area of permutation patterns and its applications. Major themes in the conference include the structural theory of pattern classes, asymptotic behavior of pattern classes, generalized pattern avoidance,<br/>packing densities, and algorithmic and decidability problems. Research in the area is influenced by theoretical computer science, and traces its historical origins to the study of sorting machines. Combinatorial interest in permutation patterns focuses on centrally important enumeration and packing problems, for instance the extremal problem to determine how one pattern can be embedded as often as possible in a permutation. The statistics of permutations also enters into the picture, garnering attention from probabilists. The conference is expected to have a wide impact on a variety of different research areas in mathematics and computer science."

In complex systems where rules of randomness are well understood and sufficiently many underlying events are independent of each other, aggregate behavior at large scales tends to deviate very little from the median behavior. This phenomenon, known as concentration of measure, has been the subject of exciting developments, since concentration tools allow one to analyze many essential properties of rather general systems. Being strongly motivated by challenging purely mathematical questions, this research area also has a wide range of applications in disciplines such as information theory, statistics, computer science, and machine learning, among others. This research project is aimed in particular at a correct understanding of the role of the growing dimension, especially in the problems where high dimension serves as a unifying force. High-dimensional models are useful in practice for instance to understand the entire evolution of a phenomenon in time, not just the governing local rules, which may lead one's low-dimensional intuition astray. The project will have an important impact correcting such misconceptions in mathematics, and will have further impact when these ideas are applied to areas such as statistics and machine learning. The project will also have broader impact on educating undergraduate and graduate students in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/>The project's themes refer either to long-standing open problems or to challenging questions related to recent developments. More specifically, the investigator plans to develop new concentration tools starting from the spherical concentration phenomenon and its extensions to Grassman and Stiefel manifolds. With new tools, one of the targets of investigation will be the circle of problems related to the K-L-S conjecture of Kannan, Lovasz, and Simonovits. The project will explore refined concentration properties of high dimensional projections of log-concave and more general convex measures; in particular, the work will investigate new integral geometric characteristics of convex measures on Euclidean spaces that are responsible for spectral gap and Cheeger isoperimetric constants. Part of the project is devoted to asymptotic expansions in the central limit theorem for the relative entropy and Fisher information, including Berry-Esseen bounds, and their applications to optimal transport for sums of independent random vectors. The project also deals with information-theoretic inequalities and transport problems about empirical distributions."

It underlies models of air turbulence, chemical dynamics, and algorithms for big data. Such models are often high dimensional or even infinite dimensional, as in the case of turbulence. Central to understanding these systems is understanding the way both energy and randomness are spread by nonlinear interactions in the dynamics. This research project explores a number of directions that exploit both the geometric and algebraic structures of such systems to better understand these basic transport phenomena. The investigators will work to understand how such interactions can lead to stabilization in systems that are unstable in the absence of randomness. The project includes research participation by graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students.  At the high school level, the investigators will also work to keep the students' teachers connected with cutting-edge mathematics, helping them to be more effective and better informed as teachers. In addition, videos chronicling the student research efforts will be made in collaboration with a center for documentary films to further disseminate the experience and broaden the project's impact. <br/><br/>This collaborative research project in stochastic analysis and dynamics will explore the propagation of noise and dissipation in stochastic systems and their effects on the existence and structure of stationary states. There is particular emphasis on effects that occur in stochastic partial differential equations, the ability of noise to stabilize unstable systems, and non-equilibrium steady-states in forced systems. Many of the equations to be investigated are physical models (e.g. from fluid mechanics or non-equilibrium statistical physics) while other equations to be studied serve as examples that aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms producing stability or instability in such systems. This work will build on the investigators' previous work in designing Lyapunov functions in the finite-dimensional setting of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) and establishing practical methods for proving unique ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium in both the finite-dimensional setting of SODEs as well as the infinite-dimensional setting of SPDEs. While the research is anticipated to have immediate implications in fluid mechanics and statistical physics, the techniques that will result from studying such systems will be applicable to a wide family of problems in other areas, such as biology, engineering, physics, and finance, which regularly employ stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations as modeling tools."

Specifically, the project investigates the mathematics behind portfolios that outperform a standard index such as S&P 500 in the presence of volatility. The utility of such portfolios is that in that process they reduce volatility demonstrably, and thus contribute to the stability of financial markets. Although ad hoc use of such portfolios is widespread, a systematic mathematical study has been limited so far. It turns out the mathematics is related to some very modern topics in probability and geometry, especially that of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport maps. Successful completion of the research will not only lead to striking new mathematics in probability and information geometry, but will also imply very practical applications in modern portfolio management, with potential societal benefits of the highest level via increased financial stability. <br/><br/>The investigator plans to study an array of problems linking the fields of optimal transport and interacting particle systems, with applications to modern portfolio theory. There are two parts to this project. The first one investigates the behavior of exponential stochastic integrals where the integrand is given by a solution of a Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport map. The study is an interesting interplay between geometry of the unit simplex and universal behavior of stochastic integrals when they are not martingales. Classical probability relies heavily on the martingale property of stochastic integrals. Here, the investigator explores a completely distinct class of behaviors that should be of independent interest. The second part studies properties of interacting continuous-time particle systems in finite and infinite dimensions. These particle systems, originally coming from stochastic portfolio theory, can be thought of as a continuous-time analogue of the discrete time exclusion process on the integer lattice. However, unlike exclusion processes, very little is known about these processes. They are conjectured to display striking phase transitions. The project aims to establish concentration inequalities and fluctuation estimates (among other properties) for such processes, which is a step towards proving more subtle behavior of these processes."

At the transition point, the properties of the system such as the volume or heat capacity may change discontinuously. The aim of our research is to study phase transitions in mathematical models using probabilistic tools in the following three directions. (1) The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a permutation is the length of a maximal subsequence of the permutation in which the elements increase. How long is the LIS for a uniformly random permutation? This question has been studied in connection with practical applications such as sorting sequences, disk drive scheduling and airplane boarding times. The mathematical study of the LIS has revealed deep and unexpected connections of the problem with areas such as the theory of random matrices, analytic combinatorics and random polymer models.  The proposed research aims to study the LIS when the permutation is drawn from certain non-uniform distributions and associated phase transitions. (2) Many computational problems can be phrased as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) where one wants to find a solution to a number of variables with a set of constraints imposed on them. CSPs were first studied in computer science motivated by applications to artificial intelligence. To study the difficulty of finding solutions in typical rather than worst case scenarios, researchers study random CSPs. Using sophisticated heuristics, physicists have made detailed predictions about the location and nature of phase transitions in random CSPs. The accuracy of these heuristic predictions motivates the importance of discovering the rigorous mathematical foundations of these techniques. (3) Interacting particle processes are used to model large, randomly evolving interacting systems of agents that arise in the natural sciences including in physics and in biology. The exclusion and interchange random walks are examples of such interacting particle processes. In the symmetric case the long term mixing behavior of the random walk and the nature of phase transitions is well studied. The goal of this research is to understand the mixing properties of natural asymmetric and weighted versions of these processes. While achieving these three goals, the principal investigator will create exciting research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in probability, mentoring programs with the goal of retention of women in mathematics, and the development of online curricular material.<br/><br/>The main aim of this project is to develop new theory and analysis for phase transitions in certain discrete probabilistic models. The first problem is to study the limiting distribution of the LIS in non-uniformly random permutations by way of analyzing the fluctuations of the LIS as the parameter of the distribution is varied. The distribution is known to be Gaussian in one regime of the parameter and Tracy-Widom in another and we aim to study this transition. The second problem is to study the condensation and clustering transitions in random CSPs such as the hardcore model on random graphs. The research aims to identify the location of the reconstruction threshold more precisely in these models and to explore the connection to the clustering transition. Finally, the proposal will consider Markov processes such as asymmetric exclusion and interchange and attempt to relate the mixing times and spectral gaps of these processes to the corresponding quantities for a single particle and to understand the cutoff phenomenon for these processes."

The statistical analysis, in turn, relies on assumptions which, if violated, can lead to incorrect or misleading outcomes. In many modern applications, the statistical modeling is further complicated by inherent structural inhomogeneities in the population. Specific examples include the spread of information in social networks, genetic variation among mitochondrial DNA sequences from different species, collisions of particles suspended in a non-uniform medium, and identification of suspicious activity in a criminal or terrorist network. With these applications in mind, the project initiates a systematic study of probabilistic models and inferential principles for data taken from heterogeneous or specially structured populations. Attainment of these goals requires techniques from several mathematical and scientific areas and should lead to progress at the intersection of applied science, statistics, probability, and mathematics. Project outcomes will lead to a better understanding of how fundamental statistical assumptions affect the validity of scientific conclusions. The mathematical theory and statistical methods developed should have a broad societal impact, as combinatorial stochastic processes are used throughout modern applications in physical, biological, and social sciences, national security, and beyond. The PI has extensive plans for training graduate and undergraduate students in the methods to be used, via courses on the foundations of statistics at both levels, the supervision of Ph.D. theses, and conferences and workshops on these topics for these and other early-career researchers. The plans are innovative and the PI will devote significant time and resources to them. In particular, a strong emphasis will be placed on attracting and hiring students from underprivileged backgrounds who are first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The specific technical objective is a rigorous mathematical theory for understanding random structures that exhibit relative exchangeability and other invariance principles.  A hallmark of the project is the in-depth study and rigorous development of theory and applications for edge exchangeable network models, which were first introduced by the PI as a novel invariance principle for network analysis.  Desired outcomes include relative invariance principles, structural properties, and characterization theorems for evolving combinatorial structures. The project will also exploit deep connections between combinatorics, algebra, logic, and probability theory to refine prior work by de Finetti, Kingman, Aldous, Hoover, and Kallenberg, on graph limits and Levy-Ito-type representations of Feller processes on combinatorial state spaces. Theoretical developments should guide methodological advances in specific applications, including climate science, network science, and phylogenetics."

Lattice models, constructed to study natural phase transitions, are probability distributions on subsets of graphs depending on continuous parameters. This research project will study the phase transition of several important lattice models, including (1) the constrained percolation model, which randomly assigns ""0"" or ""1"" to each vertex of a graph, satisfying constraints that represent aspects of molecular structure; and (2) the self-avoiding walk, which is a path on a graph visiting each vertex at most once, introduced as a model for long-chain polymers. The work will broaden and deepen the mathematical foundations of the subject, with potential important applications in theoretical physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>The investigator aims to develop new theory concerning the phase transition of certain lattice models. Imposing constraints in the percolation model usually makes the model lose stochastic monotonicity, which, in the unconstrained case, is critical to study the phase transition described by the behavior of infinite clusters. One goal of the project is to develop new combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to study the behavior of infinite clusters without using stochastic monotonicity. Enumerating self-avoiding walks is typically difficult due to the non-Markovian structure. The connective constant and exponent of self-avoiding walks are fundamental properties of the underlying graph, yet can be identified for very few graphs. Another goal of this project is to obtain new information about connective constants and exponents for large classes of graphs, which may be achieved by analyzing harmonic functions on graphs. An analog to the central limit theorem in two dimensions is the limit shape behavior of height functions of certain lattice models at criticality, i.e. when the phase transition occurs. The investigator also plans to study the limit shape, using techniques from complex analysis and algebraic geometry."

Many of such phenomena may be modeled by continuous time stochastic processes.  The first stochastic process that has been extensively studied is the celebrated Brownian motion, named in honor of the botanist Robert Brown, who observed and described in 1828 the random movement of particles suspended in a liquid or gas. The same  process was later used in 1900 by the mathematician Louis Bachelier to model stock prices on financial markets. Finally, in 1905,   Albert Einstein brought this process to the attention of physicists by presenting it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. The Brownian motion is an example of diffusion process. Like their ancestor the Brownian motion, diffusion processes appear in many different areas of sciences and economy and their  theoretical mathematical study has far reaching consequences in understanding and making predictions about the phenomena they model. In this  project, the PI will study several problems in  the theory of diffusion processes. In particular, questions about the deep interaction between the diffusion process and the geometry of the ambient space will be addressed and rates of convergence to equilibrium will be studied.<br/><br/>Mathematically speaking, the present project focuses on different aspects of the theory of diffusion processes and diffusion semigroups. The PI will investigate applications to sub-Riemannian geometry where diffusion methods turn out to be very fruitful to study generalized Ricci curvature lower bounds. The PI  will also address several questions about hypocoercive diffusions. Hypocoercivity is a concept recently introduced by Cedric Villani to obtain quantitative estimates for the convergence to equilibrium of some highly degenerate hypoelliptic semigroup. Hypocoercive estimates are in general very difficult to prove and the PI will systematically  study  new methods which parallel the Bakry-Emery approach to hypercontractivity.  Some problems in the rough paths theory of Terry Lyons will also be studied, in particular related to the properties of stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian processes. These projects will involve the training of graduate students and junior mathematicians. The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the blog of the PI."

These processes are useful to model the complex systems that arise in the study of sociology, biology, criminology, seismology, finance, and many other fields. The most standard point process is the Poisson process that has independent time increments, which means that future jumps are independent of what has occurred in the past. However, one does not often observe independent time increments in real-world data. For example, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis, credit defaults have a contagion effect -- a default of one company can trigger more companies to default. In social networks, the possibility for users to re-share the content posted by their social connections may cascade across the system. In seismology, after an earthquake hits, the area often experiences aftershocks. In criminology, gang-related violence has the property that a murder or shooting by one gang often provokes retaliation by another gang. All these examples have in common the self-exciting property: an event can trigger more events to come. Self-exciting point processes, the subject of this research project, constitute a class of point processes that can describe such phenomena. Despite their importance in applications, many key central facts are still unknown. This project will investigate the theoretical aspects of self-exciting point processes, as well as their applications. It aims to advance understanding of how complex and large stochastic systems self and mutually excite, interact, cluster, and effect contagion. The results derived from this framework will be applied to better understand the big data sets arising from complex systems in the real world. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project studies a class of self-exciting point processes, with a focus on the Hawkes process and its extensions, including the nonlinear Hawkes process. To date, the limit theorems for this model are restricted to large time asymptotics, and they have been well studied except the multivariate nonlinear case, which will be investigated in this research. The investigator intends to understand the large asymptotics on a fixed time interval, which will be very useful in the context of many applications. These large asymptotics will differ from the Poisson process and phase transitions are anticipated. The investigator will also study the fluctuations and large deviations of the mean-field limit of a multivariate Hawkes process when the dimension is large, which is useful in applications to neural networks, financial networks, and others. The project will also explore the spatial Hawkes processes, the space-time Hawkes processes, and other types of self-exciting point processes that have been suggested for modeling but still lack some key theoretical results. The investigator also aims to study applications of the self-exciting point processes, including theoretical applications to queueing theory and to fitting these models to real world big data sets, which requires a better understanding of some theoretical aspects of the simulations and calibrations of self-exciting point processes."

A dynamical system consists of a state space, in which a point represents a complete description of the state of the system, and a rule governing the evolution of the system from one state to another. This project focuses on the long-term behavior of such systems from two complementary points of view. From the first point of view, the project seeks to describe the behavior of typical systems when the rules of evolution are chosen at random. Such results shed light on what properties one might expect to find in disordered systems. The second point of view, the ""inverse problem,"" concerns the statistical problem of recovering some information from the observation of a dynamical system. While there are many examples of dynamical systems being used as mathematical models, and there is a large statistical literature regarding inference and estimation, the performance of statistical procedures when applied to data generated by nonlinear dynamical systems is poorly understood. This project focuses on characterizing when traditional statistical procedures may be effectively applied in the context of dynamical systems. Beyond the very fertile potential applications, the project will also have broader impact on training of graduate students who will acquire invaluable skills in sound probabilistic modeling and statistical inference by working on the project's research topics.<br/><br/>Symbolic dynamical systems, which may be defined in terms of discrete constraints on the possible trajectories, serve as prototypical models of systems that evolve over time. Random ensembles of these systems may be produced by selecting the constraints at random. Ideas from both discrete probability and dynamical systems may then be used to analyze the structural properties of the resulting systems with high probability. For the inverse problem, this project seeks to evaluate the performance of several statistical inference procedures, both frequentist and Bayesian, when the models involved are dynamical systems. Fundamental questions about convergence and consistency of the procedures may be addressed using tools from ergodic theory, such as joinings and the thermodynamic formalism."

It underlies models of air turbulence, chemical dynamics, and algorithms for big data. Such models are often high dimensional or even infinite dimensional, as in the case of turbulence. Central to understanding these systems is understanding the way both energy and randomness are spread by nonlinear interactions in the dynamics. This research project explores a number of directions that exploit both the geometric and algebraic structures of such systems to better understand these basic transport phenomena. The investigators will work to understand how such interactions can lead to stabilization in systems that are unstable in the absence of randomness. The project includes research participation by graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students.  At the high school level, the investigators will also work to keep the students' teachers connected with cutting-edge mathematics, helping them to be more effective and better informed as teachers. In addition, videos chronicling the student research efforts will be made in collaboration with a center for documentary films to further disseminate the experience and broaden the project's impact. <br/><br/>This collaborative research project in stochastic analysis and dynamics will explore the propagation of noise and dissipation in stochastic systems and their effects on the existence and structure of stationary states. There is particular emphasis on effects that occur in stochastic partial differential equations, the ability of noise to stabilize unstable systems, and non-equilibrium steady-states in forced systems. Many of the equations to be investigated are physical models (e.g. from fluid mechanics or non-equilibrium statistical physics) while other equations to be studied serve as examples that aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms producing stability or instability in such systems. This work will build on the investigators' previous work in designing Lyapunov functions in the finite-dimensional setting of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) and establishing practical methods for proving unique ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium in both the finite-dimensional setting of SODEs as well as the infinite-dimensional setting of SPDEs. While the research is anticipated to have immediate implications in fluid mechanics and statistical physics, the techniques that will result from studying such systems will be applicable to a wide family of problems in other areas, such as biology, engineering, physics, and finance, which regularly employ stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations as modeling tools."

Mathematical versions of the concepts of phase transitions, threshold behavior, critical phenomena, and scaling limits have value which is now well recognized in areas which at first sight might have seemed far from the statistical physics where these concepts originated.   Mathematical studies of such topics have led to fundamental developments in modern probability theory.  In turn, rigorous analysis has  provided useful feedback on our understanding of the relevant physics.  Examples of the latter are found in the disorder effects on phase transitions in two and three dimensional classical and quantum systems systems (such as the so-called Imry-Ma phenomenon), and in the spectral and dynamical effects of disorder in the context of random quantum operators. The PI was instrumental in past works of this type, including recently, in which he contributed key results which helped uncover new classical and quantum physical phenomena thanks to studies in probability theory.  The projected research will both continue and redirect the PI's efforts, and will necessarily continue be interdisciplinary in nature. Beyond its use of probability theory and mathematical analysis on physics questions, the results of the research could potentially bring broader impacts to other areas where modern probability theory is helping elucidate new phenomena, such as computer science and engineering, and data science.  Of particular note with this project's other broader impacts is the potential for outcomes of the highest caliber in training the next generation of US scientists. Based on the PI's past and recent supervision of extraordinarily talented graduate students and postdocs under NSF support, the project will certainly allow the PI to offer research experience of the highest level for such future trainees at Princeton University. Some of the research will be carried out in collaboration with top researchers from other institutions, providing valuable networking opportunities for the trainees.    <br/><br/>The PI's attention will be redirected towards critical phenomena in a number of instructive models below their upper critical dimension, a concept whose understanding was firmly advanced by PI's previous work on percolation, Ising spin systems and phi^4 field theory.   It was recently noted that the techniques by which the PI has previously established the Gaussian (bosonic) nature of the Ising model's scaling limits in dimensions greater than four yield also simple proofs of the fermionic nature of certain correlation functions in the planar case.   Some of these relations have been known through exact solution of the two dimensional model, but the new argument suggests a path towards explanation of ""universal"" emergent planarity in a class of critical non-planar and non-solvable two dimensional models.   Related questions concerning critical phenomena will be explored for the three-dimensional case, which is neither trivial nor solvable yet of obvious interest.  Work will also continue on classical and quantum effects of disorder on the spectral and dynamical properties  of random operators, and on the structure of Gibbs equilibrium states of systems with quenched disorder."

This structure helps to discover new phenomena that tend to be universal (i.e., present in a very wide range of systems). As a result, using sophisticated mathematical tools, the principal investigator seeks to find new universal laws that play the role of the famous and familiar bell curve law and that can often be observed through physical and numerical experiments.<br/><br/>The goal of the emerging field of integrable probability is to identify and analyze exactly solvable probabilistic models. The models and results are often easy to describe, yet difficult to find, and they carry essential information about broad universality classes of stochastic processes. The project aims at developing a bridge between deep algebraic and representation theoretic structures on one end, and probabilistic systems on the other end, that would allow to utilize the former in order to discover and study the latter. The framework of Macdonald processes introduced and developed in the last five years has been quite successful on this path, and it continues to grow. Known applications include interacting particle systems, random growing interfaces in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions, random matrices and log-gases, and directed polymers in random media. The framework is now poised to expand to include the theory of solvable lattice models of statistical mechanics, offering completely new perspective and new results in this well-established domain."

A network is comprised of a certain number of objects (normally referred to as 'nodes' or 'vertices') connected by links of various importance ('edges' and their 'weights'). Analyzing network data is notoriously challenging. An important task is to group the vertices into subgroups such that each subgroup is highly connected, and any two subgroups have only loose interconnections. Even if one is only trying to identify merely two subgroups (known as the min-bisection problem), no efficient algorithm is known to partition the nodes of large graphs in general. The situation changes when one considers that the graphs might have a random structure. Indeed, for many reasonable probabilistic models on graphs, there appear to be efficient algorithms to solve the min-bisection problem. This project will develop our fundamental understanding of these probabilistic models and will study efficient algorithms to treat them.<br/><br/>The project focuses on various models of sparse random graphs, the simplest being the Erdos-Renyi (independent edges) random graph, with bounded average degree. Many statistical inference tasks can be addressed by suitably defined combinatorial optimization problems. For instance, the min-bisection problem requires to find a balanced partition of the vertex set that minimizes the number of edges across the partition. These optimization problems are associated to certain Gibbs measures on the underlying graph, from which the optimizers are recovered as ground states. Statistical physicists conjectured that these Gibbs measures are asymptotically equivalent (for random graphs) to Gibbs measures of suitably defined spin glass models. This project aims at establishing this connection on a firm basis and exploiting it to study the structure of large random graphs. It has also recently been suggested that semidefinite-programming relaxations for the same problems can be studied through other Gibbs measures (with vector spins). Studying these spin models will improve our understanding of efficient algorithms for solving these tasks."

The project includes training of graduate students in probability theory and its applications. <br/><br/>The project will study several questions in probability. One class of problems concerns the evaluation of Wilson loop expectations in lattice gauge theories, which has important applications in physics. The project aims to provide a rare rigorous result in this topic, giving the first proper mathematical justification for the famous 1/N expansion of lattice gauge theories. A second class of problems involves theoretical properties of importance sampling and various applications of these properties. The project aims to solve the mathematical problem of determining the minimum sample size required for good performance of importance sampling in any given setting. Lastly, a third class of problems centers around probabilistic techniques for proving that small perturbations of Dirichlet Laplacians are quantum unique ergodic."

This research project investigates a set of questions in probability and statistics raised by large-scale data collection. While of increasing use, empirical Bayes methods have proved difficult to justify. The approach under development in this project brings a novel application of exponential family theory to the job, with the goal of clarifying how empirical Bayes analyses converge to traditional Bayes methods as sample sizes increase. The project aims to develop empirical Bayes methods that use large-scale parallel data sets, such as those from microarray studies, to improve estimation in situations reporting many small sub-experiments, each of which by itself has low accuracy; and improved Monte Carlo methods for the computer solution of massive optimization problems.<br/><br/>Specific topics under investigation in this research project include large-scale empirical Bayes strategies, importance sampling for computer-assisted inference in formerly intractable situations, and a theory of stability assessment for traditional methods of accuracy estimation.  Exponential families of probability distributions play a central role in both computation and statistical inference. A particularly stubborn impediment to their use in massive data analyses is the lack of a suitable norming constant in the exponential family density. This research project further develops computational methods based on solutions of appropriate variational problems; a promising application is in the area of graphical models. A second application of exponential families involves efficient deconvolution of datasets to obtain empirical Bayes estimates."

The occurrence of different cell types in different parts of a tumor, the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor, can lead to failure of therapy that is directed only against one type of cancer cell. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity is associated with a worse prognosis in many cancer types, and the spatial distribution of nutrients and oxygen can favor the development of more aggressive tumor cell populations. By analyzing spatial cancer models, this research will provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of intra-tumor heterogeneity in solid tumors, and into the role of cellular mobility in shaping tumor phenotypes with poor prognosis. To guarantee that the results are relevant to treatment, the project will be carried out in collaboration with physicians and a cancer biologist. The involvement of graduate students in this research will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and biology. <br/><br/>This project addresses critical challenges in the quest for more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches in the fight against cancer. Complex agent-based models have often been employed to investigate the impact of space on cancer evolution. However, even if a simulation successfully reproduces observed phenomena, it does not mean that the true underlying mechanism has been found. For this project the investigators plan to extend prior work on spatial Moran models by adding new features to the basic model. To further reduce the gap between analytically tractable and complex computational models, the behavior of the new systems will be analyzed mathematically. The biological questions to be addressed by the project are motivated by recent experimental findings, including studies of the impact of cancer cell migration on solid tumor growth and elucidation of the role of cancer stem cells in driving cancer evolution. Mathematical models that can include genomic data will be used to study genealogies and intra-tumor heterogeneity in colon cancer. Rigorous results for hybrid models that describe tumor-microenvironment interactions will also be derived. More generally, the rigorous analyses of the models will require the development of novel mathematical techniques that will contribute to a deeper understanding of spatial stochastic systems and the behavior of genealogies in an expanding population."

Convex geometry is the bedrock for studying isoperimetric principles, laws that govern fundamental relationships between shapes and their size. The most famous such example is the classical isoperimetric inequality asserting that among all shapes of a given perimeter, circles enclose the largest area. Such principles underlie a wealth of extremal problems, e.g., in mathematical physics, information theory, optimization, among others. The PI and his coauthors have shown that global geometric features can be consequences of local random structure; his probabilistic tools reveal new and more quantitative information than is apparent from the standard principles. Conversely, the geometry of the underlying shapes can have implications in probability. This arises, for example, by replacing independence conditions by broader dependence structures, thereby making probabilistic results more broadly applicable. A major goal of the research is to use geometric considerations such as the presence of many symmetries as a guide for the replacement of independence. In a closely related direction, in applied sciences the ""curse of dimensionality"" refers to the notion that increasing a system's dimension comes with an unwieldy increase in complexity. On the other hand, a distinguishing feature of modern probability and convex geometry is that increasing the dimension brings unexpected benefits: patterns must arise simply by virtue of high-dimensionality. Mathematically, this is referred to as the ""concentration of measure phenomenon"" and it is fundamental in dealing effectively with large data sets, compression of signals, reducing complexity of algorithms, to name a few. The PI and co-PI will develop new tools to give considerably more accurate information on refined asymptotic scales, which are especially needed for applications. Here, as above, isoperimetric principles guide the development of the theory. The PI and co-PI will teach graduate courses on these topics, which will serve as excellent venues for engaging students in current research. Such courses may be of interest to students in computer science, statistics, or engineering whose research depends vitally on mathematics.<br/><br/>The project centers on concentration properties of high-dimensional probability laws, particularly for marginal laws due to their connection to small deviation inequalities and non-asymptotic random matrix theory. Using affine isoperimetric principles, the PIs will investigate criteria for well-boundedness of marginal distributions, especially under non-independence regularity assumptions such as affine invariance properties. They will also study concentration properties of norms on high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, building on the co-PI's refinements of Milman's random version of Dvoretzky's theorem for some classical normed spaces, circumvent the standard approach via Lipschitz constants by using super-concentration techniques and other refined tools. The PI and co-PI will extend the study of concentration of functionals to the multi-dimensional setting of Grassmannian manifold of linear subspaces of Euclidean space. This is a natural unified setting for the various problems above: marginals of probability distributions, the asymptotic theory of convex bodies, stochastic geometry and randomized isoperimetric inequalities. Consequently, a better understanding of the associated randomness on the Grassmannian will have diverse applications."

The goal of nonlinear filtering is to obtain best statistical estimate of the state, which can be the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle, of a stochastic dynamical system based on noisy partial observations of the state.  As a key tool for data assimilation, nonlinear filtering has applications in vastly diverse research areas including biology, mathematical finance, signal processing and target tracking. A particular example of target tracking is the guidance and surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) which have been playing an essential role in national security and defense.  Through nonlinear estimates  of target location based on the observations from multiple sensors, nonlinear filtering forms a core component in unmanned aerial vehicle targeting and navigation systems.  Because of vast amount data at an increasing rate of availability, traditional nonlinear filtering methods such as Kalman filter and particle filter are often inadequate to handle high dimensional and highly nonlinear problems.  This research project aims to develop fast and adaptive numerical algorithms to attack such nonlinear filtering problems. Several graduate students will participate in this project. <br/><br/>This project is to conduct research in developing high order and adaptive numerical algorithms and the corresponding numerical analysis on nonlinear filtering problems.  The focus is on the PDF filter, which solves the nonlinear filtering problem by solving the conditional probability density function (PDF) for the optimal filter through a stochastic partial differential equation or a backward stochastic differential equation.   We will develop two classes of algorithms: the first solves the Zakai equation on adaptively constructed computational domains and on sparse grids; and the second solves a class of backward stochastic differential equations. Both algorithms overcome three difficulties for the PDF filter: i) high dimensionality; ii) low regularity; iii) unbounded domains. The overarching objective of this proposal is to make the PDF filter a highly competitive numerical method for nonlinear filtering problems. In particular, the novel BSDE based PDF filter studied in this proposal achieves a high order of convergence, which is much faster than all other existing nonlinear filtering methods.<br/>"

All these areas undergird much of science and technology. The public is familiar with probability from everyday life, but often is not aware of how crucial it is in today's economy, for example, or in today's computer algorithms in common smartphone apps. Group theory studies symmetries and lies behind much of modern physics. Analysis started from calculus, invented to study moving bodies and now used throughout science and engineering. Ergodic theory is the least known of these branches of mathematics; it began in physics with the study of systems of many particles, such as gases. It now provides a unifying framework to study many disparate questions, including some in computer science. As one example, in the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.  It is always desirable to have finite approximations to infinite objects, and the same holds for infinite groups.  Gromov and Weiss suggested a way to use finite networks for this purpose, at least for those groups known as ``sofic"". It is not known how widely this approach works.  The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it.  If one can actually succeed in making such approximations for all groups, then this would resolve a host of important conjectures in a variety of fields of mathematics.  The PI will continue work on this fundamental question. One of the project's most important broader impacts is on the strengthening of STEM education, by training of undergraduate and graduate students at Indiana University, who will profit form working closely with the PI on the project's cutting-edge mathematical topics of the highest caliber. Conversely, the PI will work with a talented cohort of students who will contribute significantly to his research agenda to understand finite group approximations, particularly in analyzing the behavior of probabilistic objects on Cayley graphs.<br/><br/>Among the analysis of probabilistic objects on Cayley graphs, some of the topics which the PI will investigate with his graduate students include a class of random processes of points, known as determinantal.  Certain of these arise from Hilbert spaces via orthogonal projections.  The resulting processes seem to provide random spanning sets. Especially interesting applications are in complex analysis. The analogue for an infinite discrete ground set was established earlier by the PI. It is proposed to make the same connection in general, which would establish a conjecture of the PI and Peres.  It is also proposed to understand better how close two determinantal probability measures are when their generating matrices are close. Such a result in the finite case is very likely to extend to the infinite case as well, at least in the infinite ""sofic"" situation studied in the first problem above. Other problems on which the PI will collaborate with his graduate students include continuous-time non-colliding random walks on graphs beyond the one-dimensional lattice and cycle, first passage percolation, and random walks on Galton-Watson trees."

The aim of this research project is to develop systematic mathematical theory to understand dynamic networks: systems that evolve over time through probabilistic rules. The investigator plans to develop robust mathematical techniques to understand how macroscopic connectivity arises via microscopic interactions between agents in a network. One important direct application is whether a message or a disease is able to reach -- or at risk of reaching -- a significant fraction of the population of interest. Mathematical techniques used to understand such questions have unexpected connections to combinatorial optimization, where one is interested in designing optimal networks between individuals, particularly by considering an important concept known as the minimal spanning tree. The project will also explore swarm optimization algorithms (inspired by the collective behavior of simple individuals such as ants) and their ability to solve hard optimization problems via probabilistic interaction rules through stigmergy (where the network of interacting agents changes the underlying environment which then effects the interaction of the agents). An important component of the project is involvement of students at all levels, including the development of undergraduate research seminars and research projects. <br/><br/>Understanding the metric structure of the giant component and the critical scaling window in inhomogeneous random graph models has been daunting, yet for several decades the community of combinatorial probabilists has seen it as key to understanding more complicated strong disorder systems.

The investigator plans to show convergence to continuum limiting objects based on tilted inhomogeneous continuum random trees and in particular to prove universality for many of the major families of random graph models. Scaling exponents of key susceptibility functions in the barely subcritical regime will be studied.

The most common example of such noisy input is Brownian motion, which occurs in models throughout science, engineering, and economics. Within this context, the so-called rough paths theory is a powerful method that allows one to define noisy systems in a wide variety of situations (well beyond the Brownian motion case). The rough paths theory also gives an almost-deterministic point of view on stochastic calculus, as opposed to the traditional approach, which is highly probabilistic in essence. The term stochastic analysis usually encompasses both stochastic integration of It type and Malliavin calculus techniques. The latter can be viewed as a way to define an analysis at the path level; it leads to deep and useful results concerning stochastic differential equations. This research project aims to combine rough-paths and Malliavin calculus techniques in order to give a meaning to and then study noisy partial differential equations that model heat transfer in random environments. The project will also study the large time behavior of differential equations driven by a general class of noises, and see how to statistically identify this kind of system by observing a typical path. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on interactions between rough paths theory, stochastic partial differential equations (PDE), and Malliavin calculus. A more specific list of the six subprojects can be structured as follows: (1) stochastic PDEs, with (a) parabolic Anderson model in rough environment, (b) parabolic Anderson model in dimension 2, and (c) density for solutions to rough PDEs; and (2) rough finite-dimensional systems, with (a) ergodic properties for rough differential equations, (b) estimation procedures for rough stochastic differential equations, and (c) renormalization of numerical schemes for rough stochastic differential equations.  In all those projects, the principal investigator will use stochastic analysis methods combined with analysis and rough paths tools in order to study some new yet very natural classes of processes. Because even the definition of those objects was far from clear before the rough path theory was introduced, their study is both motivating and challenging."

This award supports research into the understanding of permutations from a mathematical perspective, in particular permutations involving large numbers of objects. Powerful new techniques at the interface of combinatorics and probability allow the large-scale study of the behavior of ensembles of permutations. Experience with other large combinatorial objects has led mathematicians to expect them to behave in certain predictable ways. As a result, when such permutations arise in nature and do not have the predicted properties, scientists know to seek a hidden explanation. For example, this involves the study of the significance of the order of genes on a chromosome, and the knowledge of the behavior of ensembles of large random permutations may tell geneticists when to look for a pattern.<br/><br/>New discoveries have made it possible to learn much more about the nature of large permutations. In particular, the space of permutations of all sizes can be completed by limit objects that are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals. By maximizing a certain entropy integral, one can, in principle, find the limit object that describes nearly all permutations with certain given properties. The proposer and his collaborators will be using both analytic and experimental techniques to exploit this variational principle. One important objective, barely begun, is to plot the landscape of permutations with two fixed pattern densities and determine, for each feasible point, the number and character of the corresponding permutations."

Understanding these structures is a long-standing challenge in probability theory; this project focuses on the mathematical study of these structures. One class of these, percolation, has arisen to study various random networks: for instance, underground rock formations carrying oil, traffic networks in cities, and polymer chains. Another class of these, Abelian networks, arose to describe situations where energy builds up microscopically until it reaches a certain threshold and then causes a large ""avalanche,"" and has been used to model earthquakes. A major issue the work under this project will touch on is how widely-separated (in space or time) parts of the random structure depend on each other: for instance, how do early topplings in an avalanche influence those occurring much later? These questions have connections to other important physical systems as well as to optimization problems from computer science.<br/><br/>The research under this award will study correlations and fluctuations in disordered systems (first-passage percolation and related disordered magnets) and critical systems (percolation, and Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld models also known as sandpiles). A primary focus in first-passage percolation will be the order of fluctuations of the random metric and its relationship to properties of geodesics. In critical percolation, the work will focus on the scaling of the chemical or graph distance in large finite clusters -- in particular, bounding the chemical distance exponent in two dimensions. A final focus will be structural properties of avalanches in the Abelian sandpile model, including the question of stabilizability of sandpiles in two dimensions."

The Program, which will be the principal activity of the CRM in this period, is comprised of five intensive week-long workshops. In addition, there will be lecture series by three leading mathematicians: Nalini Anantharaman (Univ. Strasbourg), Yuval Peres (Microsoft Research), and Scott Sheffield (MIT). The workshops will be preceded by preparatory lectures for advanced graduate students. Numerous long-term visitors and postdoctoral researchers will be hosted at CRM throughout the seminar; this award provides support for junior US researchers to participate in the program. <br/><br/>Probabilistic methods have played an increasingly important role in many areas of mathematics. The CRM Thematic Program will cover a broad range of such topics, including: geometric analysis on manifolds of metrics and applications to spectral theory and quantum chaos; geometry of random metrics and related problems in quantum gravity; applications of probabilistic techniques in partial differential equations; eigenstate localization in random domains; probabilistic results in number theory; random simplicial complexes and geometry of spaces of triangulations and connections to geometric group theory, manifold learning, topological statistics, and geometric probability; probabilistic methods in 3-manifold theory; random growth problems and random matrices, and their connections to stochastic partial differential equations (such as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation) and to integrable discrete models. The program is naturally interdisciplinary, with an emphasis on interconnections and cross fertilization of ideas between researchers working in probability, geometric analysis, spectral theory, group theory, topology, geometry, and mathematical physics. Young researchers will be provided with an excellent opportunity to learn from and interact with experts in these fields. <br/><br/>http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/en/index.shtml"

One of the most interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the resulting system of particles. This non-homogeneity can result in abrupt changes in structure, called spatial phase transitions, where the system breaks into pieces with very different local behaviors. For example under a pressure gradient, water can have both solid and liquid phases in the same container. It is a challenging mathematical problem to understand these phases and their common boundaries. The project will investigate some of the mathematics involved in describing these kinds of phenomena at a generic level, with a goal to characterize the macroscopic shapes of the systems and their internal interfaces based on an understanding of their microscopic interactions. One of the main outcomes of this project, beyond the discovery of mathematical laws describing the complex behavior of condensed matter, will be the training of Ph.D. students in the mathematical sciences who will profit from working on cutting-edge topics in probability theory and combinatorics.<br/><br/>The research project will study mathematical models of such limiting-shape behaviors, in several different settings, notably in planar configurational models such as ""square ice"" and related integrable statistical mechanical models. Bethe Ansatz techniques, although notoriously difficult in general, can be effectively applied in certain limiting situations to obtain mathematically rigorous limit shape theorems, as this project plans to show."

It is a very active field, since many questions in other fields can be represented mathematically as matrix problems. For example: the spectra of heavy atoms in physics, statistical estimation of covariance matrices in statistics, capacity of quantum channels in quantum communication, conducting properties of semiconductors (Anderson models). This project aims to study the basic properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar (conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate students who have an interest in probability theory. The investigator will also run workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to random matrix theory as well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.  <br/><br/>The investigator will focus on the identification of the eigenvalue densities, the local eigenvalue statistics and the  eigenvector distributions of  many different classes of random matrix ensembles. The ensembles considered in this project include anisotropic  matrices, band matrices, i.i.d. random matrices, and general non-Hermitian matrices. One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied. The investigator will apply some new ideas on these type of matrices. In this proposal, some projects are also designed for training graduate and undergraduate students, which include proving the universality phenomenon for more general random matrix ensembles."

Such models arise in diverse areas of application; the models in this project are taken from materials science, social science, genetics, and distributed computing.  Specific examples are: an interface between regions of liquid in a pipe; candidates sequentially dropping out of a primary election; tree-search for approximate evaluation of a Boolean function. Common to all these models is an underlying mathematical structure in which initial conditions are random, after which the evolution is governed by a non-random mechanism.  Analyses of evolutions without randomness is often considerably more difficult than analysis of those with randomness.  The focus in this project is on creating tools to circumvent this problem.  In most cases the PI seeks qualitative answers to questions such as: what does the system look like after a long time, how long does it take to reach this state, and how robust is the description to changes in the initial conditions? The project's broader impacts beyond the potential applications to the aforementioned areas, include the training of graduate students in the mathematical sciences at the University of Pennsylvania who will have opportunities to engage in research on highly non-trivial topics in probability theory. The PI will also devote some effort to improving STEM education at a broader level through the development of innovative techniques for calculus instruction and curriculum development. The PI will investigate the systematic mathematical study of certain common practices which have suffered from a lack of methodological validation, as a further broader impact.<br/><br/>The mathematical techniques to be used in this project involve the introduction of time reversals.  In a time reversal, randomness of initial conditions becomes randomness of the time-reversed path.  Once there is randomness in the evolution, it is possible to use techniques from Markov chains, statistical mechanics, and other applications of probability theory. There are a number of Markov chains that describe time reversals of a given system.  Suppose one's concern is to describe the time-zero distribution of a system evolving deterministically from random conditions at time minus infinity.  Among possible Markovian time-reversals, the one that describes this is the one with the maximum entropy.  The PI then plans to compute this using a variational principle."

The conference website is https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/12461/.  The topics of the conference are at the interface of mathematics and physics and are concerned with uncovering through exact calculation the universal behaviors of large, complex random systems. There are two main types of random systems -- those which are growing and those which have stabilized to a sort of equilibrium. The universal behaviors of each of these types of systems are rather different in characteristic. However, recent advances have indicated surprising connections between the behaviors of non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems. This conference will bring together experts in both areas with the aim of stimulating new advances and spark new connections. There is a strong emphasis on educating a new generation of researchers to appreciate and understand the broad cycle of ideas and motivations from both mathematics and physics in this area.  Half of the lecturers will be mini-courses and the other half, research talks. This will benefit the many early-career researchers who will participate in the conference. The US participants funded by this award, most of whom are early-career researchers and graduate students, will benefit additionally by the opportunity to forge relations with their European colleagues. The organizers will actively encourage the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM, including women and minorities.<br/><br/>Universality within and between complex random systems is a striking concept which has played a central role in the direction of research within probability, mathematical physics and statistical mechanics.  Complementary to universality, is the exact description of the behaviors that are expected to be universal as well as the determination of which systems are meant to display them.  In recent years there has been an immense amount of progress in the rigorous mathematical understanding of certain universal scaling limits in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physical systems.  On the equilibrium side, critical scaling limits are often described in terms of conformal field theories, among which Liouville quantum gravity plays an important role.  On the non-equilibrium side, systems like growth processes are described through the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.  There is reason to believe that these two directions share many (as of yet) unexploited relationships.  For instance, the field of quantum integrable systems was developed to study equilibrium systems, but has now found itself center stage in the KPZ universality class.  Conversely, methods developed in stochastic partial differential equations for non-equilibrium systems have begun to make their way into constructive field theory.  The purpose of this two-week conference is to bring together experts in these two areas and enable a lively exchange of ideas and methods through mini-courses and research talks."

The study of randomly generated matrices is one of the most exciting areas of mathematics today, with theoretical advances giving us an ever-growing picture of what ""typical"" matrices are like, and providing us with important applications in areas like image compression and the analysis of the Big Data that surrounds us.  In this project, the PI will continue her research program investigating the behavior of very large random matrices, and how that behavior depends on the way they are generated; this will advance the theory, which will help better understand the applications to some of the areas mentioned above. She will also complete her monograph ""The Random Matrix Theory of the Compact Classical Groups"", which gives an overview of what has been learned about randomly generated matrices with a particular relationship to high-dimensional geometry; this activity will disseminate difficult technical knowledge about random matrices to a broad audience.   The PI is active in teaching at all levels, and particularly in mentoring and encouraging girls and young women interested in mathematical careers; those training and outreach activities will have great impact on the diversity of those entering STEM fields.<br/><br/>The monograph mentioned above will describe the remarkable advances in the theory of Haar-distributed random matrices in recent years.

This research is expected to lead to a more complete and deeper understanding of random matrices, with considerable impact on related areas of science. <br/><br/>Technically speaking, two aspects of random systems will be studied: singularity and universality.
