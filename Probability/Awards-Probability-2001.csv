Four topics concerning stochastic dynamics of Ising spin systems, the random cluster and Ising ferromagnetic model, and the contact process are proposed to be studied. The first topic concerns stochastic dynamics of an Ising spin system on an infinite lattice where spins evolve according to the usual Glauber dynamics. Some typical questions are: does a spin flip infinitely many times or only finitely many times? what is the probability that a spin has not yet flipped at time t? The second topic is about Ising models on hyperbolic lattices. Although Ising models on the hypercubic lattices have been studied intensively and extensively since they were introduced, these models on hyperbolic lattices have just started to receive attention from physicists and mathematicians. They are found, by both numerical studies and mathematical proofs, to exhibit a phenomenon of multiple phase transitions. Although some results have been rigorously proved, many statements suggested by numerical studies are to be proved, and many more are to be explored. Some GHS type inequalities in the random cluster model and a related question of uniqueness of the random cluster measure are the contents of the third topic. The final topic deals with phase transitions of models with low-dimensional inhomogeneity. These models include percolation, Ising ferromagnetic systems and contact processes.<br/> Models of the sort to be studied in this research arise naturally from physical sciences. Percolation is a probabilistic model of studying flow through a discrete disordered system, such as particles flowing through the filter of a gas mask, or fluid seeping through the interstices of a porous medium, while the contact process can be regarded as modeling the spread of an epidemic through a population.<br/>"

The first one is equivalent to the universality conjecture of the local eigenvalue statistics of random matrices, an equilibrium problem. The second one is the construction of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory from a microscopic model, a nonequilibrium problem. As to the first problem, we use a new, entirely analytic strategy to extend the known universality for the unitary matrices also to the other types of random matrices: real symmetric, complex normal, and quaternionic self-dual. The strategy applies to the bulk and to the edge of the spectrum. We also apply our method to the study of the Laughlin wave function of superconductivity, which is of a related structure. As for the second problem, we use the recently laid microscopic dynamical foundations of relativistic many-particle theory to establish the first derivation of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory in form of a weak law of large numbers. We also study its fluctuations around the limit in form of a central limit theorem. <br/> The universality conjecture is currently one of the top priority problems of random matrix theory, a subfield of probability and mathematical physics. Its applications range from nuclear physics, nanotechnology and superconductivity on the physics and technology side to deep number theoretical implications on the mathematical side - which in turn have applications in cryptography and related fields. The conjecture has been proven so far for the simplest type of matrices, but a proof for more general matrices has so far been elusive. The relativistic Vlasov theory of charged particle systems forms the dynamical basis for a large part of high temperature plasma physics, with applications ranging from thermonuclear fusion research to space plasma research, e.g. about the solar wind and magnetic storms. Its microscopic atomic underpinnings, which have so far eluded researchers, will make it possible for the first time to systematically study the accuracy of Vlasov theory and in particular to compute its leading corrections."

The averaging principle for deterministic and stochastic perturbations, asymptotic problems for reaction-diffusion equations, and problems related to stochastic resonance are among them.  The long-time evolution of perturbed systems with conservation laws, even in the case of purely deterministic perturbations, leads, in general, to stochastic process on complexes defined by the conservation laws.  So the classical averaging principle (say, for deterministic perturbations of integrable Hamiltonian systems when the Hamiltonian has many critical points) should be treated in the stochastic framework.  In this research small diffusion asymptotics for reaction-diffusion in an incompressible 2D-fluid, which is closely related to the averaging for Hamiltonian systems, is studied.  Another class of problems concerns the large deviation theory and stochastic resonance.  A number of new effects such as large amplitude oscillations and stabilization induced by the small noise in autonomous systems are considered.<br/><br/>The asymptotic approach is one of the most powerful tools of applied mathematics.  In particular, the averaging principle plays the leading role when systems combining multi-scale processes are considered.  Such problems arise in mechanics, in material sciences, in biophysics, and in other areas.  This research does not just consider problems concerning the mathematical justification of the averaging principle, but also describes new applications and new effects.

Shreve<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Work is proposed in two areas.  The first is the analysis of queueing<br/>systems with deadlines under heavy traffic conditions.  Consider a<br/>queueing system with renewal process arrival streams.  Suppose that<br/>upon arrival, each customer is assigned a lead time, the amount of time<br/>until the customer's deadline for service elapses.  One can model the lead<br/>times of the customers in queue at a station as a counting measure on the<br/>real line, the location of the point masses corresponding to customer lead<br/>times.  Research will address the convergence of these measure-valued<br/>processes under heavy-traffic scaling.  Research will also be directed to<br/>mathematical models for finance.  On such model is for an option on a<br/>traded account.  For the simplest of these, an account trading one<br/>underlying geometric Brownian motion and a constant-interest-rate money<br/>market, there is a strikingly simple optimal rule: hold the geometric<br/>Brownian motion long when the account value is negative and short when<br/>the account value is positive.  For an option on two geometric Brownian<br/>motions, there is a conjectured optimal rule, which is supported by<br/>numerical analysis.  The proof appears to require the development of new<br/>mathematics.  A second mathematical finance problem concerns the<br/>development of a unifying model for risk-neutral pricing of credit<br/>derivatives.<br/><br/>This research has two parts.  The subject of the first part, queueing<br/>systems with deadlines, arise in communication networks, especially<br/>networks used to transmit digitized video or audio signals.  Data which<br/>are too long delayed can cause unacceptable disruption  of the signal.<br/>The proposed research  will provide a basis for performance analysis of<br/>heavily-loaded communication networks which take deadlines into account.<br/>The subject of the second part, mathematical models for finance, builds on<br/>the revolution in finance begun by the Black-Scholes option pricing <br/>formula.  The particular work proposed here  is concerned with proper<br/>pricing and usage of financial instruments whose purpose is to insure<br/>against loss, either due to drastic reduction in market value (options on<br/>a traded account) or default (credit derivatives)."

When we have a large system of particles interacting through local interactions, the evolution of such a system when it starts far away from equilibrium poses several questions. Density being often the only conserved quantity, there is usually some sort of a transport equation appearing as the scaling limit. Superposed on it is the motion of individual particles, which is usually an inhomogeneous Markov process after the interactions are somehow averaged in the scaling limit. Laws of large numbers as well as fluctuations and large deviations from them are some of the interesting problems in this context. In addition the coefficients arising in the limiting descriptions are functions of density and or other parameters and the regularity of their dependence on the parameters is also of importance.<br/> There are a large class of physical processes where the rules of behavior are prescribed at the level of individual units. These rules concern the nature of the interaction between individual units that could involve some randomness as well. But one needs to make predictions of the collective behavior of the units at a much larger scale. This project deals with the derivation of the rules of collective behavior from models of interactions at the level of individual units. In the physical sciences examples of such problems that have been successfully studied include the rules of fluid flow that are derived from the laws of interaction between molecules that make up the fluid. Similar problems in the social sciences, for instance one of predicting macroeconomic behavior based on models of economic exchange between individuals, have not been adequately addressed. <br/>"

Basic examples of particle systems studied are exclusion-type processes and Hammersley's process. Special situations studied in this project include bottlenecks, traffic jams, boundaries between different phases, priorities between individuals, and other irregularities that disturb the individual particles. An interface model describes the growth or decay of one phase relative to another. Examples of mathematical models in this category are last-passage models, models of increasing sequences, and marching soldiers models. The questions addressed are the speed, the eventual shape, and the roughness of the interface. The results of this project will concern the macroscopic behavior of these models and the fluctuations and deviations around the expected behavior. <br/> A basic feature of the world around us is that natural processes occur at several different scales. Large scale features are formed through the combined effect of a vast number of operators on a smaller scale. This can be observed in physical processes, biological processes, and man-made processes. For example, the disorganized motions and collisions of individual fluid particles make up the flow of a river; competition and cooperation at the level of individuals determines the evolution of a population; and the behavior of vehicles on a freeway determines the flow of traffic. Many different complex systems share common basic principles of organization and behavior. Such shared features can be abstracted in mathematical models, and analysis of these models then has implications for many particular applications. This project is about the mathematical study of such models, and the outcome of this project is a better understanding of the behavior of certain classes of models of complex systems."

A common theme for these problems is the notion of a phase transition which comes up in various guises. The first set of problems to be investigated concerns elucidating the relationship among the notion of finitary mappings, a concept which is relatively old, the much newer and important notion of exact simulation and finally the existence of a phase transition. It is already known that there are intimate connections between these. A second set of problems concerns better understanding the relationship between the phase diagram for various statistical mechanical systems (such as the Ising or the classical Heisenberg models) and the underlying graph on which they live. These questions lead to the study of phenomena which do not arise on the classical Euclidean lattices. A third set of problems concerns determining the sets of capacity 0 for certain concrete Markov processes arising in particle systems (e.g., the stochastic Ising model). Finally, a fourth set of problems concerns understanding the class of stationary processes which arise from positive contractions in Hilbert space, a class of stationary processes which have very different behavior than processes traditionally studied. Even for these systems, the concept of phase transition arises. <br/> Many systems in the world evolve stochastically and probability theory is utilized in order to better understand and predict the behavior of such systems. For example, statistical physics is the study of how particles behave globally and more generally how various general cooperative systems evolve. Understanding such systems is part of the motivation for this project. Another goal of this project is to determine how certain abrupt changes occur within a system (a so-called phase transition such as when water boils) and to investigate the underlying conditions which lead to such phenomena. There are various distributions which arise here which are important to investigate but for which one is not able to make explicit calculations. In such cases, a key tool is computers which, via simulations, allows us to approximate these distributions. In many cases, one can sample exactly from these distributions and one more goal of this project is to understand when this is possible.<br/>"

Most of these questions are set in a group-invariant context and the goal is to understand how geometric or algebraic properties of the group are reflected in probabilistic properties of the processes.  For example, in the random cluster model, there are 4 natural critical values of p for each value of q.  The PI is continuing his previous investigations of the relations among these values on planar Cayley graphs of groups.  Two other models under investigation concern random spanning forests in graphs.  One of these is obtained from limits of minimal spanning trees in finite graphs, while the other is from uniform spanning trees.  The former is connected to percolation, a special case of the random cluster model.  The latter, connected to random walks and potential theory, is much better understood.  The PI is working to bring the state of knowledge of the minimal spanning forest closer to that for the uniform spanning forest.  There are also many open questions related to the uniform spanning forest that the PI is investigating.  When one views uniform spanning forests as determinantal probability measures, there are a large number of new questions that open up.  For example, the PI is working to establish basic topological properties of higher-dimensional analogues of random forests and to establish conjectures that arise by analogy to percolation. Phase transitions and entropy of other determinantal dynamical systems are also under investigation.<br/><br/>The field of statistical physics is concerned to a great extent with mathematical models of phase transitions (e.g., water to ice).  Typically the model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions.  This lattice is infinite and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group.  The simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in the ground and gas flow through a gas mask.  One asks how far fluid can flow, in particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far.  This, of course, depends on the density of particles; there is a phase transition as the density increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can no longer flow arbitrarily far.  One would like to know where that point is and how the probability changes as this critical point is approached.  About a decade ago, several researchers began investigating lattices that are quite different from the usual Euclidean ones that are most familiar and that most closely correspond to our physical world.  These new lattices, called nonamenable, are also usually based on groups. Such investigations began out of the usual scientific and mathematical curiosity that drives fundamental research.  Within the last 5 years, this area of research, statistical physics on nonamenable groups, has seen an explosion of interest.  This area of research turns out to be quite rich and to contain a large number of important fundamental questions whose answers remain unknown.  Already, there have been applications to Euclidean lattices of some of the new ideas that have arisen in response to the need to develop new tools for nonamenable groups.<br/>"

Until recently their work was based on an isomorphism theorem of Dynkin, which is difficult to prove and to apply. In the last two years this has all changed. Together with Professors Eisenbaum, Kaspi and Shi, they have obtained new, simple isomorphisms relating local times and Gaussian processes and have greatly simplified and clarified their early work. They have also obtained many new results; the most significant is a simplified version of Ray's theorem on the local times of diffusions. They will continue this work to generalize the scope of Ray's theorem to consider local times of processes which are not continuous. They will apply their new results and techniques to consider other properties of Markov processes that can be studied through their local times. They also plan to extend their results to more general classes of continuous additive functionals of strongly symmetric Markov processes by comparing them to Gaussian chaos processes. Professor Marcus will continue his studies of sample path properties of infinitely divisible moving average processes. These process are fundamental in applied mathematics. They appear to have remarkable smoothness properties and to behave better than similarly defined Gaussian processes. This surprising observation will be investigated. Professor Rosen plans to study the time needed for a simple random walk to visit each point on a finite graph. The case of the two dimensional lattice torus is particularly challenging. He intends to study this discrete problem by relating it to a continuous one concerning Brownian motion on the two dimensional torus. This in turn will lead to the analysis of `late points', those points whose approach by the Brownian path takes an unusually large amount of time. Professor Rosen also plans to study points of infinite multiplicity on the path of planar Brownian motion.<br/> This research deals with fundamental properties of stochastic processes and has potential applications in all areas that deal with random phenomena. Generally speaking phenomena that evolve in time do so in a random fashion. Examples are the Dow Jones average, data on global warming or communication with satellites. Of particular importance is the amount of time that a process takes a specific value. This is studied in terms of the local time of the process. In this proposal the local times of Markov processes will be investigated by means of associated Gaussian processes. Until very recently these two important classes of stochastic processes, Markov processes and Gaussian processes, were considered to be essentially unrelated. Professors Marcus and Rosen have shown that they are intimately related and are searching for a unified theory for these important processes."

Moreover, on a finite regular tree, the critical temperature for rapid mixing is lower than the critical temperature for uniqueness of Gibbs states on the corresponding infinite tree. The investigator intends to study precisely which aspects of the geometry of a graph (e.g. spectra, Cheeger constants) are most relevant to the mixing rate of Glauber dynamics. Modern approximation schemes for ""hard"" combinatorial problems (e.g., counting matchings in a graph) use processes related to Glauber dynamics, so new insights on these dynamics will have an impact on randomized approximation algorithms.<br/> Large networks of interacting particles have been studied for decades in statistical physics, as models of magnetism, freezing, and other physical processes.

In the last twenty years, these dynamics have been used in image analysis, approximate counting algorithms, and communication networks. While most of the mathematical results and physical predictions available are restricted to quite special networks (where the particles are arranged in a regular lattice), they have motivated applications where the underlying network has completely different structure.

The networks (graphs) have long been used as abstract mathematical descriptions of real-life social and technological networks. In 1960 Erdos and Renyi began studying a mathematical model of a graph with many vertices that slowly evolves in time, as one link after another is inserted between two randomly selected nodes. However idealized, this model captured a combinatorial complexity of the real networks that are poorly connected at the inception and become more and more tight as more and more pairwise links appear in a chaotic fashion. Erdos and Renyi discovered a remarkable mathematical phenomenon: for a long time the evolving graph remains split in many small connected components, and then during a relatively short time period the graph undergoes a dramatic transition which results in the appearance of a giant connected subnetwork (subgraph) that contains a positive fraction of all vertices. This pioneering work started an avalanche of research aimed at elucidating deeper feautures of the phase transition phenomenon and tracking down the likely changes in the graph structure after the giant component has appeared. This research includes a detailed study of the group of largest components at the moments when they are about to merge into a giant component. Another component of this research is to have a close look at a core of the giant component, i.e. the largest subset of vertices in that component which are connected to each other noticeably stronger than to the other vertices. The principal investigator will work on alternative random graph models that may be closer to the real-life networks. One such network is the World Wide Web. There is a body of interesting, but not rigorous, research on the networks that grow population-wise in such a way that the most connected nodes are statistically preferred as contacts by the arrivals. The proposer plans to study these network growth processes jointly with D. Aldous and A. Frieze.<br/> Other classic examples of combinatorial structures are the partitions of sets and integers. And again there are numerous illustrations of how useful and insightful these abstractions are in applications. An integer partition is a partition of a given integer into decreasing parts. A central problem is to study the structure of a partition chosen at random among all such partitions. Since the pioneering work by Erdos and Lehner, the studies by Szalay, Turan, Fristedt and this investigator resulted in discovery of a rather detailed picture (shape) of the typical partition. The investigator plans to continue his research on the random integer partitions, and to extend it to the random plane partitions, a surprisingly rich combinatorial scheme, whose probabilistic aspects have only started to emerge. The investigator plans to combine enumerational tools and the probabilistic techniques in order to study the geometric characteristics of the typical plane partitions. The random partitions have been found critically important in probabilistic studies of optimization problems. One such well known problem is to partition a given set of numbers (weights) into two groups so that the weights of two groups are as close to each other as possible. Simplicity of this problem is deceiving: there is no efficient algorithm to solve it when the set of weights is large. It is natural then to switch attention and to study computational complexity of a typical problem when the individual weights are random. In on-going joint research C. Borgs, J. Chayes and the investigator have found a parameter of the problem whose value plays a crucial role in determination of how intrinsically difficult a typical instance of the problem is. Much as the partition problem differs from the evolving random graph, there is a striking similarity between two structures: both experience a rapid transition within a surprisingly narrow window on the parameter scale. The research will continue, and the collaborators plan to broaden it, to include various other optimization problems."

The recent study shows that the asymptotic magnitudes of additive functionals of a Harris recurrent Markov process are measured by the partial Green functions. The progress suggests further questions and establishments in broader situations. The project lists four areas in which the limit laws of related additive functionals will be studied under this research. As the first step toward the general theory, the investigator will look for relations between weak and strong laws for additive functionals. Specifically, the investigator will study the limit theorems for additive functionals of diffusion processes and for the local times embedded in various norm spaces, and the strong laws for occupation times arising from interacting particle systems. <br/>The significance of this study is also due to its connections to some important problems.

In the area of asymptotic enumeration, he will obtain approximations to coefficients of multivariate meromorphic generating functions that are asymptotically valid as the multi-index goes to infinity in any possible way.  The ultimate goal is to automate this procedure, at least for the class of (multivariate) rational generating functions with nonnegative coefficients. Previous results indicate this may be feasible, or at least may be carried out to some extent.  These results are to be applied to several combinatorial problems in probability theory, including asymptotics for random tilings for the so-called Aztec Diamond configurations and other related tiling ensembles conjectured to produce polynomial phase boundaries.  In the area of random processes with reinforcement, he will investigate the rate at which processes of stochastic approximation type converge to their ultimate limiting behavior.  In particular, the slow convergence of vertex-reinforced random walks and uniformly reinforced social network models to their limits is to be explained by giving quantitative bounds on the probabilities of deviating from this behavior at finite times.  It is hoped that this will both explain simulation data and give a theoretical basis for the use of these models.  Among the other miscellaneous problems are several problems in economic game theory and one concerning asymptotics of solutions to functional equations.<br/><br/> Recent progress in computer algebra has made many types of computation automated which once were done only by skilled practitioners.  Nowadays, a few messy equations are no barrier at all to a complete theoretical and practical understanding of a problem.  The most tangible result of the asymptotic enumeration project will be the transformation of a formerly difficult type of computation into a straightforward, though messy, series of steps.  Applications reach far beyond the motivating examples of random tilings, and include queuing theory, signal processing and combinatorial enumeration.  Reinforcement processes arise most commonly in three application areas:  formal models of learning, population biology, and economic behavior. In each of these areas, the results of the project will shed light on when and why the theoretically predicted limiting behaviors are not observed in the timeframes of real applications.<br/>"

The investigator intends to systematically study moderate deviations for self-normalized sums of independent random variables, for Hotelling's t-statistic and for studentized U-statistic. The objective is to establish a Cramer type moderate deviation theorem under a finite third moment condition. Since the self-normalized moderate deviations require few moment conditions, they not only extend classical limit theorems but also provide much wider applicability to other fields, particularly to statistics. The study should also help us better understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since the t-statistic and U-statistic are their building blocks.

These types of probabilities often arise in estimating the chances of rare events occurring in areas where such events are of fundamental importance such as weather prediction, natural disaster prediction and economic indices. One of the objectives is to develop new methods of estimating small ball and lower tail probabilities. The focus is specifically on small ball probabilities of the Brownian sheet in high dimensions and lower tail probabilities for stationary Gaussian processes.

In the context of optimal control, <br/>the decision maker is allowed to adjust the level of control <br/>only at times when an exogenous process gives him a green light; <br/>for example, when an Poisson process makes a jump. In the area of <br/>optimal stopping, the state process is allowed to be stopped only <br/>at times when it receives certain signals from an exogenous process.  <br/>Both formulations admit explicit solutions and can be applied to <br/>model practical constraints on control policies or stopping times. <br/>The second part of the project is concerned with a class of diffusion <br/>processes with jumps. The major effort is put on their applications <br/>to economics and finance.  The reason for the introduction of such <br/>processes is that the classical diffusion model for stock prices <br/>cannot explain many empirical puzzles. For example, an abnormality <br/>called volatility smile is often observed in option pricing, and the <br/>return distributions of financial assets exhibit a leptokurtic feature. <br/>We intend to explain these phenomena, using the jump processes to model <br/>stock prices in a financial market or the values of economic projects <br/>in investment problems. The discontinuous behavior in the underlying <br/>processes requires new techniques to obtain explicit solutions to <br/>certain pricing and wealth optimization problems.  The research project <br/>includes pricing commonly traded exotic options, analysis of utility<br/>maximization, and evaluation of investment projects.<br/><br/>Stochastic optimization is one of the main topics in modern applied <br/>mathematics, with many applications in disciplines like engineering, <br/>biology, economics and finance, etc. The purpose of this research <br/>project is to systematically develop mathematical theories that are <br/>more faithful to real life problems, so that the conclusions drawn <br/>from them can be used with more confidence. For example, a better <br/>understanding for the uncertainty of stock prices can help agents <br/>reduce the risk in financial practice. However, in developing more <br/>realistic models, one must be aware of the subtle balance between <br/>complexity and mathematical tractability. A realistic yet too <br/>complicated model can be mathematically untractable. The goal of <br/>the project, therefore, is to develop analytically or numerically <br/>solvable models that embrace the essence of the practical problems. <br/>To this end, some new formulations are considered for general <br/>stochastic optimization problems in order to accommodate some <br/>practical constraints; for example, the controller can intervene <br/>the system only at times when an exogenous process sends out a <br/>certain signal.  Also considered are some new models for <br/>economics and finance that incorporate the drastic changes of <br/>stock prices over short periods of time. These new models can be <br/>used to explain many empirical puzzles that the classical models <br/>fail to do, and to help agents develop better portfolios to reduce risk.<br/><br/>"

In one dimension, p-variation norms work well for Frechet differentiability. Extensions to several dimensions are being pursued.  In Bayes asymptotics, normal approximations with small relative errors are being found even for small probabilities of intermediate deviations.<br/><br/>In Bayes asymptotics, one of the goals is to choose the best of several statistical models, possibly for multiple data sets.  For example, multiple clinical trials may be done of a treatment for a disease.  Three models are that the treatment is helpful, is harmful, or makes no difference.  Further models incorporate the possibility that the treatment may have substantially different effects in different study populations.  The procedure is to begin with a noninformative prior probability distribution on each model, then adjust it based on the likelihoods from each data set.  Improved approximations of the updated probabilities are being investigated. For differentiable statistical functionals, a data set gives an approximation to a probability distribution.  If a nonlinear transformation is applied both to the true distribution function and to its approximation, one looks for a linear transformation that approximates the nonlinear one as well as possible in the neighborhood of the true distribution.  One is also looking for effective ways of bounding the discrepancy between the true and approximate distributions and their transformations. <br/>"

The third project is a rigorous study of the NK model of protein evolution.

A particle performing an edge reinforced random walk on a graph has memory and prefers to traverse edges that were traversed before.  It is known that some reinforced random walks exhibit behavior very different from that of the classical random walks without memory.  The aim of the first project is to show that edge reinforced walks for which each edge is reinforced only once, by a fixed amount, are not so different from the classical random walks.  The batch service queueing system is a model of a retail store delivery van, or a terminal in a computer network which downloads software packages.  The purpose of the second project is to describe a large class of batch service policies that keep the queueing system stable, and to find easy to implement policies in this class, that are close to optimal with respect to a specific cost function.  The NK model is an idealization of protein evolution in the presence of selection.  The interacting Moran models represent a subdivided population with a resampling mechanism within each subpopulation, and migration of individuals to neighboring subpopulations.

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) The Ising model conditioned, by fixing an excess of the minority spin, so as to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, with emphasis on the critical size of this excess and the discrepancy between the actual and ideal shape of this droplet. (2) Percolation models also conditioned to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, with emphasis on lower bounds for the local fluctuations of the boundary. (3) Mixing properties and decay of correlations and connectivities for spin systems and percolation models, particularly in finite volumes. (4) The spectral gap and rate of convergence to equilibrium, for the stochastic Ising model at low temperature. (5) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are opposed to each other. (6) The use of percolation ideas to create a model which mimics certain features of the freezing of water which contains impurities. The project aids human resource development through the support of one Ph.D. student working on similar problems.<br/><br/>This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reflect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors; (iv) composite materials with special properties; and (v) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small-scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. The systems which Alexander will investigate--percolation, random cluster models, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems--are examples of such abstract systems."

Limit theorems play a fundamental role in the development of probability and statistics. The principal investigator continues his study in this direction in general, focusing on self-normalized limit theorems in particular. The investigator intends to systematically study moderate deviations for self-normalized sums of independent random variables, for Hotelling's t-statistic and for studentized $U$-statistic. The objective is to establish a Cramer type moderate deviation theorem under a finite third moment condition. Since the self-normalized moderate deviations require few moment conditions, they not only extend classical limit theorems but also provide much wider applicability to other fields, particularly to statistics. The study should also help us better understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since the t-statistic and U-statistic are their building blocks. Another area where limit theorems prove useful is the study of the real zeros of random algebraic and trigonometric polynomials. Such polynomials with random coefficients arise in many disciplines and their behavior is of interest to statisticians, engineers, economists, and mathematicians. The primary focus of the second topic is on estimating lower tail and small ball probabilities for Gaussian processes. These types of probabilities often arise in estimating the chances of rare events occurring in areas where such events are of fundamental importance such as weather prediction, natural disaster prediction and economic indices. One of the objectives is to develop new methods of estimating small ball and lower tail probabilities. The focus is specifically on small ball probabilities of the Brownian sheet in high dimensions and lower tail probabilities for stationary Gaussian processes. The investigator also intends to study basic sample properties for a newly introduced family of Gaussian processes which have the same scaling and time inversion properties as the Brownian motion but are infinitely differentiable. It is believed that this new family of Gaussian processes would prove useful in many other fields as mathematical models. <br/> This project is devoted to the study of two topics: (i) limit theorems in probability and statistics, and (ii) lower tail and small ball probabilities of Gaussian processes. Limit theorems play a fundamental role in the development of probability and statistics. It is hoped that the first part of this research may lead to the development of a self-normalized limit theory in probability and statistics, while the second part of the research could provide significant new knowledge about Gaussian random processes as well as about our random environments."

Unlike the Gaussian case, there are infinitely many different stable sssi processes. This overwhelming variety may be regarded as a fundamental problem. One now has to understand how these processes are different or what it is that they have in common. However, non-Gaussianity also brings to the picture new tools that were unavailable in the Gaussian case. It has been known for quite some time now that non-Gaussian stable processes having some invariance property, like self-similarity or stationarity of the increments, can be associated with nonsingular flows. It is then based on some properties of these flows that one can describe the structure of the corresponding stable processes. The focus will be at first on an important subclass of stable sssi processes called self-similar mixed moving averages. The connection of self-similar mixed moving averages to nonsingular flows allows one to decompose them into separate, independent processes and then explore each part in the decomposition separately.<br/> The purpose of this research is to better understand a class of random processes that have characteristics that one encounters in many areas of applications. Examples of such processes include the limit of the so-called renewal reward processes applied in telecommunications and ""random wavelet expansions"" introduced in probabilistic modeling of images. These processes are fractal-like. They display scale invariance and tend to take often extreme values that deviate greatly from the mean. Their mathematical structure is complex. The goal of this research is to develop tools that can be used to analyze that structure"
