While different structures are often studied on a case-by-case basis, this project aims to develop general mathematical tools to explain the interplay between randomness and the underlying structure. The focus of the project is on two distinct areas, random matrix theory and metric geometry, where recent advances provide powerful new tools to understand essentially arbitrarily structured models. Such technology makes it possible to study a range of problems that are outside the reach of traditional methods, with applications both in pure mathematics and in areas such as data science and computer science. Graduate and undergraduate student researchers will participate in the project, there will be outreach to schools including middle-school math festivals,  and substantial pedagogical materials will be developed and disseminated. <br/><br/>Concretely, the project has two main themes. The first theme aims to develop a broadly applicable toolbox to investigate arbitrarily structured random matrices. The guiding principle behind this toolbox is that the behavior of structured random matrices can be modelled by the behavior of deterministic operators whose spectra are explicitly computable, building on recent advances in this area. The second theme aims to develop probabilistic methods that are motivated by the study of embeddings of metric spaces in normed spaces. Both topics leverage connections between probability theory, operator theory, functional analysis, and metric geometry. While the two themes are independent and involve different mathematical ideas, what they have in common is that they aim to develop general principles and tools to study structured problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its primary objective is to uncover novel connections between two currently active research domains that have developed independently until recently: random permutations and random geometry. The emerging interplay between permutons (limits of random permutations) and random geometric objects arising in quantum physics and statistical mechanics (such as Schramm?Loewner evolution curves and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces) will play a fundamental role in generating significant advancements in both fields. This will involve formulating novel theories for universal random permutons and random directed metrics, expanding existing ones, and effectively resolving long-standing problems on meanders and meandric systems. <br/><br/>The three main objectives of this research project are, first, to investigate the problem of the longest increasing subsequence of random permutations from a novel angle, which involves linking it to directed metrics in planar maps. The goal is to construct a 'quantum version' of the universal Kardar-Parisi-Zhang geometry, i.e., the directed landscape. Second, to study the geometry of random meanders and broader statistical physics models involving crossing fully packed loops on planar maps. The objective is to tackle the long-standing open problem of determining the scaling limit of random uniform meanders and meandric permutations. Third to establish connections between the limits of d-dimensional permutations and new scale-invariant d-dimensional random geometries introduced in the physical literature. The aim is to begin developing a novel d-dimensional theory of random geometries and permutons. The project offers opportunities for education and outreach to high school and undergraduate students, as well as mentoring of undergraduate and Ph.D. students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project studies a class of random growth models taking place in different geometric settings and will develop new tools effective for these structures; the aim is to understand the behavior of these systems and the impact of the underlying geometry on this behavior. These systems, for example, might be used to model the growth of cancer along a wall or a cylinder. <br/><br/>The extensive algebraic structure underlying integrable or exactly solvable models without boundary has been successfully used to study a variety of probabilistic questions for these models. Many of these models are expected to exhibit universality, meaning that the behavior studied should occur in a wide variety of other models. However, once non-trivial boundary conditions are imposed, our understanding is incomplete. The proposal aims to develop a better understanding of the algebraic structures involved once boundary conditions are imposed and to use this structure to attack probabilistic problems. In particular, the work aims to find new hidden symmetries for these models and to establish asymptotic results via new exact formulas for models with boundary.

The conference brings together experts and early career researchers across mathematics and theoretical physics around a common area of interest -- how do randomly evolving interfaces behave statistically over large periods of time? Such growth is ubiquitous, for instance coming up in models of cancer or bacteria growth, liquid crystal growth, or liquid diffusion through textiles. Methods to study random growth models come from a host of different fields such as probability theory, combinatorics, integrable systems, statistical physics, random matrix theory, and stochastic partial differential equations. Thus, one of the goals of this conference is to share ideas across these different areas as well as educate early career researchers on the state-of-the-art methods. Indeed, this award's entire purpose is supporting early career researcher participation.<br/><br/>In the area of random interface growth, some models enjoy special ""integrable"" structure whereby their statistical behavior can be described through exact formulas or relations. Studying the asymptotics of these formulas and relations leads to universal predictions of the behavior of a much wider class of models, including many that are not integrable. This workshop addresses promising methods both to find and utilize integrable structures and to prove that the resulting predictions are universal. The overall class of random growth models considered here is known as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. There has been tremendous progress in recent years both on the integrability and universality front, for instance with the construction of the KPZ fixed point, directed landscape, the study of multi-species models and description of invariant measures for models with boundaries. This conference highlights these advances and inspires a new generation of researchers. https://sites.google.com/view/universalityintegrabilityinkpz<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Card shuffling procedures provide a familiar, yet complex and mathematically interesting example that serves as a model for many mixing phenomena. Randomness is used to understand image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, the behavior of financial markets, as well as in the analysis of large data sets in general. It is an important tool in the study of efficient computations and scientific simulations. In all these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the behavior. This project is concerned with the fundamental properties of basic stochastic processes and how the behavior of these processes relates to the global geometric structure of their different environments. Postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students will be mentored and trained as part of this project. <br/> <br/>The funded research focusses on random processes that are defined by a related geometric or algebraic structure (e.g., Riemannian manifolds and groups). The global behaviors of these processes are determined by this underlying structure. In some cases, these behaviors can provide information on the underlying space and its structure. These explorations are at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability, with the notion of group structure playing a key part. Partial differential equations and potential theory, i.e. the study of harmonic functions and solutions of the heat equation, are also central. Brownian motion on Riemannian Manifolds and random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups provide key examples.
