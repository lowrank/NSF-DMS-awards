The conference has 21 confirmed speakers in very active and fundamental areas at the intersection of probability, analysis, and mathematical physics. The main aim is the rigorous study of universal phenomena for particle systems; to explain how random microscopic systems display predictable and statistically universal collective macroscopic behaviors. Large deviations are often key to understanding such problems, especially in large dimensions. Many problems remain in explaining how initial conditions and the details of the microscopic models govern the pre-stationary behavior. Many different approaches in this area will be represented at the conference, including spin-glasses, stochastic PDEs, and random walks in random environments. It is expected that this gathering will lead to cross-fertilization between these approaches, and inspire and inform a new generation of researchers.<br/><br/>Many of the complex systems which will be discussed in this conference aim to describe real world phenomena and results proved for the mathematical models provide predictions applicable to the real systems. A key aspect of the conference proposal is centered on general methods for hydrodynamic limits and fluctuations of particle systems, in fixed or diverging dimensions. In the past, recent progress and the inclusion of new methods has shed light on many of the important questions related to the above. These include the understanding of p-spin models, a proof of the cutoff phenomena for the statistical physics models, fine asymptotics of mixing and cover times for general models, universality in random matrix theory. However, many of the original questions and conjectures remain open. Besides physical applications, complex systems (e.g., spin glasses, growth processes and random matrices) have found many applications in computer science, machine learning, data science, bioinformatics, chemistry, and even areas like ecology and earth science.<br/><br/>The website for this conference is: https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-conference-honoring-srinivasa-varadhan/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, this simplification comes from focusing on a select few factors; however, factors that initially seem insignificant can be critical over longer time scales. Thus, a deep understanding of interactions across scales is essential for more effective models of complex systems. This project will address issues in the asymptotic behavior of infinite-dimensional systems that are governed by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiple scales, focusing on SPDEs with conservation laws?a field that remains largely unexplored for systems of infinite dimensions. The planned work will bridge significant gaps in theory and introduce new approaches to the analysis of these multiscale systems. Graduate students and postdocs will participate in the research, and the awardee will develop graduate courses and contribute to the broader mathematical community through lectures, organization of events, and editorial service.<br/><br/>Central to this research is the analysis of the Smoluchowski-Kramers diffusion approximation for stochastic systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. We aim to prove the validity of the small-mass limit for stochastic damped geometric wave equations, initially concentrating on stochastic wave maps in one dimension and expanding to more complex systems with state-dependent friction. Both non-local and local friction coefficients will be explored, studying their implications on the trajectories over finite time intervals and on stationary solutions. Further, the project plans to develop an infinite-dimensional version of the classical Friedlin-Wentcell averaging theory for random perturbations of PDEs with conservation laws. This includes constructing SPDEs that live on the level sets of specific functional, establishing the existence invariant measures for these processes, and proving their unique ergodicity and averaging limits. Through these endeavors, the proposal aims to understand better the long-term effects of small stochastic and deterministic perturbations on complex systems. By achieving a deeper understanding of these interactions, the research not only contributes to the fundamental theories in mathematical physics and applied mathematics but also provides robust tools for addressing similar phenomena in various scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical laws are usually described mathematically by differential equations.  Over the last half century, a comprehensive theory of differential equations with random noise, called stochastic differential equations, has been developed and is very well-understood in many regimes.  One area where foundational work is still needed is understanding how the behavior of systems described by stochastic differential equations scales as the dimension, i.e. the number of features in the system, grows.  This project aims to provide a broad theoretical framework and a general scaling limit theory for high-dimensional stochastic differential equations.  This theory will have significant applications to research fields as diverse as deep learning and neural networks, neurobiology (understanding learning structures in the brains of insects and other animals), the design of broadband wireless networks, and theoretical physics (quantum field theory).  The award will also support the training of graduate student researchers the dissemination of the research at conferences and workshops around the US and the world.<br/><br/>The principal research goals of this award are to study noncommutative stochastic calculus, developing a broad analytic foundation for the subject, and to prove general scaling limit theorems about the solutions of matrix stochastic differential equations (SDEs) as the matrix size grows.  Noncommutative stochastic calculus has been developed in several quarters since the 1980s, but key analytic features of the classical theory have been missed owing to the noncommutativity - often, the methods are combinatorial, and function classes are restricted to polynomials or analytic functions. Current work has developed a new approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus, using noncommutative function theory which mirrors the classical martingale theoretic approach. This yields a general theory of noncommutative quadratic variation and an Ito formula which extends all previously known Ito formulations in free probability.  This project will use these tools to study the large-N limits of NxN matrix SDEs, proving a general scaling limit for their solutions as described by noncommutative SDEs in free probability.   The outline of this approach for self-adjoint processes is now clear, and the technical difficulties should be approachable with methods described above.  A further goal is to extend such scaling limits to the non-self-adjoint setting using Brown measure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are especially useful in studying systems in which the randomness is rapidly decorrelating in space and/or time, meaning that different parts of the system are subject to independent random noise. Mathematical studies of such systems are often concentrated on how this small-scale randomness manifests in larger-scale properties of the system. The present project is aimed at studying two aspects of the theory of SPDEs. The first aspect concerns SPDEs in critical dimensions. These SPDEs have a scale-invariance that puts them just beyond the scope of many general techniques but also gives them a symmetry that can be leveraged for computations. The second aspect is to study the long-time behavior of SPDEs on unbounded domains. This involves questions about the relationship between ""long-time"" and ""large-space"" effects in random systems. The awardee also plans to engage in mentoring and exposition to broaden the use and understanding of probabilistic techniques.<br/><br/>One goal of the present project is to work towards a general theory of SPDEs in the critical dimension.  The study of stochastic heat equations in dimension two has yielded a rich set of phenomena, and the awardee plans to develop ways to understand these phenomena for larger classes of equations, such as stochastic heat and Hamilton?Jacobi equations with more general nonlinearities. The awardee also plans to further develop the understanding of critical-dimension/critical-temperature problems such as the Critical Stochastic Heat Flow. Another goal is to work towards qualitative understanding of SPDE invariant measures that do not admit explicit descriptions, and to use this understanding to study additive functionals of these processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project offers collaboration opportunities, mentorship and training for postdoctoral scholars and graduate students. <br/><br/>The proposed project primarily focuses on three research directions, with entropy theory of random walks being the underlying fundamental tool used to approach all these threads.

The second part focuses on the longstanding amenability problem of a class of groups (called iterated monodromy groups) which originate from conformal dynamics. The conformal geometry of the limit space, which can be viewed as limits of finite level Schreier graphs, plays a crucial role in the recent solution in the strongly recurrent regime. In this part the goal is to shed light on an important critical case where the limit space is the full two-dimensional sphere.

While these effects are ubiquitous in physics and chemistry, understanding them mathematically is challenging due to the need to consider the limit of large systems whose constituents exhibit persistent dependence throughout all scales. Probability theory offers a number of tools and proof strategies for this purpose provided the problem is cast, or can otherwise be represented, via elementary probabilistic concepts such as random walks or random fields. The goal of the analysis is to show that, in several settings, as the system size increases, a new structure called the scaling limit appears. Often quantitative details of the scaling limit are often independent of the specifics of the original problem, demonstrating universality. . Through the specific examples to be studied, new approaches and techniques will be developed that will advance our understanding of scaling limits and phase transitions. The questions are of varied difficulty, which will make it possible to include graduate students and postdocs in this research. <br/><br/>The project explores a diverse list of specific questions from probability, mathematical physics and analysis. First, extremal processes of branching Markov chains, local time of random walks and other random fields exhibiting logarithmic correlations will be studied with the aim to establish broad universality of the Gaussian Free Field and develop novel techniques for dealing with these problems. Second, scaling limits of random walks in random environments will be analyzed in examples that test the limits of the existing theory of stochastic homogenization. Here the particular emphasis is on the situations where the underlying environment has good spatial mixing properties and yet is not necessarily drawn from a stationary probability law. Third, a recent treatment of Bose-Einstein condensation in mean-field interacting bosonic gases using Feynman?s random-cycle representation will be expanded to establish a quantum phase transition.

While different structures are often studied on a case-by-case basis, this project aims to develop general mathematical tools to explain the interplay between randomness and the underlying structure. The focus of the project is on two distinct areas, random matrix theory and metric geometry, where recent advances provide powerful new tools to understand essentially arbitrarily structured models. Such technology makes it possible to study a range of problems that are outside the reach of traditional methods, with applications both in pure mathematics and in areas such as data science and computer science. Graduate and undergraduate student researchers will participate in the project, there will be outreach to schools including middle-school math festivals,  and substantial pedagogical materials will be developed and disseminated. <br/><br/>Concretely, the project has two main themes. The first theme aims to develop a broadly applicable toolbox to investigate arbitrarily structured random matrices. The guiding principle behind this toolbox is that the behavior of structured random matrices can be modelled by the behavior of deterministic operators whose spectra are explicitly computable, building on recent advances in this area. The second theme aims to develop probabilistic methods that are motivated by the study of embeddings of metric spaces in normed spaces. Both topics leverage connections between probability theory, operator theory, functional analysis, and metric geometry. While the two themes are independent and involve different mathematical ideas, what they have in common is that they aim to develop general principles and tools to study structured problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems, for example, might be used to model the growth of cancer along a wall or a cylinder. <br/><br/>The extensive algebraic structure underlying integrable or exactly solvable models without boundary has been successfully used to study a variety of probabilistic questions for these models. Many of these models are expected to exhibit universality, meaning that the behavior studied should occur in a wide variety of other models. However, once non-trivial boundary conditions are imposed, our understanding is incomplete. The proposal aims to develop a better understanding of the algebraic structures involved once boundary conditions are imposed and to use this structure to attack probabilistic problems. In particular, the work aims to find new hidden symmetries for these models and to establish asymptotic results via new exact formulas for models with boundary.

The conference brings together experts and early career researchers across mathematics and theoretical physics around a common area of interest -- how do randomly evolving interfaces behave statistically over large periods of time? Such growth is ubiquitous, for instance coming up in models of cancer or bacteria growth, liquid crystal growth, or liquid diffusion through textiles. Methods to study random growth models come from a host of different fields such as probability theory, combinatorics, integrable systems, statistical physics, random matrix theory, and stochastic partial differential equations. Thus, one of the goals of this conference is to share ideas across these different areas as well as educate early career researchers on the state-of-the-art methods. Indeed, this award's entire purpose is supporting early career researcher participation.<br/><br/>In the area of random interface growth, some models enjoy special ""integrable"" structure whereby their statistical behavior can be described through exact formulas or relations. Studying the asymptotics of these formulas and relations leads to universal predictions of the behavior of a much wider class of models, including many that are not integrable. This workshop addresses promising methods both to find and utilize integrable structures and to prove that the resulting predictions are universal. The overall class of random growth models considered here is known as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. There has been tremendous progress in recent years both on the integrability and universality front, for instance with the construction of the KPZ fixed point, directed landscape, the study of multi-species models and description of invariant measures for models with boundaries. This conference highlights these advances and inspires a new generation of researchers. https://sites.google.com/view/universalityintegrabilityinkpz<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Card shuffling procedures provide a familiar, yet complex and mathematically interesting example that serves as a model for many mixing phenomena. Randomness is used to understand image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, the behavior of financial markets, as well as in the analysis of large data sets in general. It is an important tool in the study of efficient computations and scientific simulations. In all these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the behavior. This project is concerned with the fundamental properties of basic stochastic processes and how the behavior of these processes relates to the global geometric structure of their different environments. Postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students will be mentored and trained as part of this project. <br/> <br/>The funded research focusses on random processes that are defined by a related geometric or algebraic structure (e.g., Riemannian manifolds and groups). The global behaviors of these processes are determined by this underlying structure. In some cases, these behaviors can provide information on the underlying space and its structure. These explorations are at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability, with the notion of group structure playing a key part. Partial differential equations and potential theory, i.e. the study of harmonic functions and solutions of the heat equation, are also central. Brownian motion on Riemannian Manifolds and random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups provide key examples.
