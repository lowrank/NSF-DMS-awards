This has both direct and indirect applications to statistics,                   and in particular to the bootstrap technique of estimation.  A                  second investigator will study the relationship between Gaussian                and Markov processes.

Part of the                   research involves the study of a class of operators which are                   called the projections of martingale transforms.

The starting point for this research is                  the work of Varadhan and Donsker, in the setting of Euclidean                   space.  Start with a Poisson distribution of spheres of fixed                   radius, and consider a large sphere of radius N.  Let D be the                  Laplace operator.  With Dirichlet boundary conditions on both                   the large sphere and the smaller ones, there is a probability                   distribution of eigenvalues (appropriately normalized) of -D in                 the large sphere.  As N increases, the random measures converge                 to a deterministic measure.

The problems consist of determining information on the nature of                signals emitted in a noise-filled environment from an unknown                   number of sources from data gathered from a collection of                       sensors.  Methods for solving the problem, such as MUSIC, rely on               the spectral properties of the covariance matrix associated with                the vector of sensor values.  This matrix is approximated by the                sample covariance matrix formed from samples of the vector data                 across time.  The sample size usually needs to be quite large in                order to effectively approximate the covariance matrix,                         especially when the number of sources is sizable.

Computer simultations indicate that                     useful information can be obtained with as little as 20 sources.                Research is also planned to solve some important mathematical                   questions concerning the limit theorems, in order to completely                 understand the applicability of the theorems to signal                          processing.
