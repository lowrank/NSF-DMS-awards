This workshop will be devoted to presenting the latest research progress on the first-passage percolation (FPP), a probabilistic model of random growth, and closely related models.  This is currently an active research area in contemporary probability theory and has important connections to statistical physics. Part of the workshop will be devoted to training graduate students and early career researchers in those topics. This award will provide travel support for the US based participants in the workshop.<br/><br/><br/>In two dimensions, FPP is a model that is conjecturally in the KPZ universality class, which consists of several models describing surface growth processes. Models in the KPZ class are intimately related with random matrix theory, asymptotic representation theory and number theory. FPP and related models have also been studied by physicists as a model for polymers in a random medium or as model of magnetic interfaces, and by biologists as the Eden model of bacterial growth. Much progress has been made on a class of these relatives which are in some senses ""exactly solvable"" by the methods of integrable probability. However, even at the physics level of heuristic, these models are poorly understood outside of solvable special cases; for instance, there are hardly any results for dimensions larger than 2. Unlike other conferences on FPP-type models, the ICTS workshop will emphasize methods outside of the integrable or exactly solvable framework. By focusing on techniques beyond exact solvability, the workshop will unify participants around solving fundamental problems of interest to the broader scientific community.

Oftentimes, such a simplification is realized by considering a smaller number of factors that are considered more relevant to the understanding of these systems and by neglecting all those factors that are considered less relevant. However, some factors that may appear less important at a certain time scale, turn out to play a crucial role at some longer time scale. Thus, it is fundamental to understand correctly the interplay among multiple scales of complex systems in order to have more effective models. This project will introduce and develop new methods of asymptotic analysis for stochastic partial differential equations. These are highly complex objects and any effort that goes in the direction of their simplified and more effective analysis is important, both for their deeper understanding and for the wide range of their possible applications. This analysis requires the development of new methods and the substantial introduction of new techniques which have to range over many fields in mathematics, from analysis in infinite-dimensional spaces to stochastic analysis and the theory of partial differential equations. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The main goal of this research project is the study of several asymptotic problems for systems that are described by stochastic partial differential equations having multiple scales. Small stochastic and deterministic perturbations of a system, which have a negligible effect on a given time scale can become crucial on a longer time scale.  Limit theorems in the framework of the theory of large deviation and metastability, various realizations of the averaging principle, small mass limits as in the Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation will be the objects of the research. What characterizes and unifies the present approach to all these asymptotic problems is the effort to understand how they all interplay and interact with each other.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to predict the correct large-scale effective behavior theoretically, physicists introduced the idea of ""renormalization,"" a systematic technique for implementing a progressive coarsening of the system of interest. The broad goal of research supported by this award is to widen and strengthen the mathematical understanding of this idea. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The past few years have seen great progress on fundamental models that can be represented as partial differential equations with random coefficients. In the present project, the investigator plans to test the versatility and power of the methods developed there on new classes of models, including Langevin dynamics and systems of particles in interaction.

Among these are so-called percolative models, which describe the flow of fluid in a porous medium, a growing bacterial infection, or a long polymer chain. Another model to be studied is the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model, the classic model of self-organized criticality (SOC), where simple, local rules generate complex, large-scale patterns. SOC has been used to explain commonalities between such apparently dissimilar phenomena as solar flares and neuron firing. Many of the most successful approaches to problems in these areas are valid only in certain special cases; for instance, certain two-dimensional percolative models with particular symmetry properties. A main goal of the project is the development of robust mathematical techniques which explain the behavior of such systems -- for instance, how smooth is the surface of a spreading drop of fluid -- in a broad range of physically interesting cases.<br/><br/>The specific research problems to be studied include the following. In critical Bernoulli percolation (where one randomly removes just enough edges to make an infinite graph finite), the PI will study scaling limits of graph components and give sharp asymptotics for graph distances and electrical resistances. In first-passage percolation (where one randomly perturbs edge lengths in a graph), the PI will study fluctuations of graph distances and the tortuosity of long geodesics. In the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model (an interacting particle system), the PI will study the correlation between particle movements at different moments of time. Some related problems have previously seemed more tractable in special settings like certain ""solvable"" growth models or in certain dimensions. This project will employ robust methods ? stochastic geometric techniques, concentration of measure methods, and others ? which apply to the widest range of possible settings and which distill the general principles underlying phenomena of interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite these impressive successes, it is not clear why neural nets work so well. In this project, the PI will use tools from probability to develop our theoretical understanding of neural networks. The goal is to give us a deep understanding of why neural nets are so efficient at overcoming challenges in optimization and high-dimensional data analysis. These theoretical insights will, in turn, inform the intuition of engineers for building the next generation of neural net-based machine learning systems. <br/><br/>Mathematically, the study of neural networks is a cross between approximation theory and optimization, touching on topics from random matrix theory, Gaussian processes, hyperplane arrangements, tensor decompositions, and optimal transport, to name a few. The PI will focus specifically on (i) the stability of gradient-based optimization of neural networks to both the linear statistics and spectral asymptotics of random matrix ensembles given by products of many random matrices in the regime where both the number of terms in the product and the sizes of the matrices simultaneously group, and (ii) computing the correlation functions of neural networks at initialization (e.g. with random weights and biases).

These processes are typically modeled using the statistical mechanics approach, i.e. by considering large systems of interacting particles, where each particle corresponds to a molecule or an individual bacterium. Imprecision of our measurements and dependence of physical processes on many factors are typically described by random perturbations of particles. Large-scale behavior of such models is observed when one looks at the systems from a sufficiently large distance, after a sufficiently long period of time. Universality in this case refers to the fact that such growing interfaces exhibit similar large-scale behavior. Description of this universal behavior gives a better understanding of the real physical processes in nature. Recent breakthroughs in probability theory, particularly in stochastic partial differential equations and integrable probability, have provided the tools to study such mathematical models.<br/><br/>The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality arises in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, when studying limiting behavior of random growing interfaces. On the mathematical level, growing interfaces appear in free energies of directed random polymers, random growth models, interacting particle systems, stochastic Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. Depending on the characteristics of models, two universal objects are conjectured to govern such interfaces: the KPZ equation and the KPZ fixed point. Recent developments in the area of stochastic PDEs allow to prove scaling limits of various discrete systems to singular stochastic PDEs. Moreover, methods of integrable probability (exactly solvable models) provided a complete characterization of the KPZ fixed point. The goal of this project is to study universal scaling limits of such random growing interfaces using these new results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The regularity structures theory also gives an almost deterministic point of view on stochastic calculus, as opposed to the traditional approach which is very probabilistic in essence. The current project should be seen as a contribution in the areas mentioned above. A combination of rough paths, regularity structures and Malliavin calculus techniques will be used to analyze some physically relevant models such as the continuous parabolic Anderson model in rough environments. Thanks to those fundamental techniques, the PI will also study algebraic and geometric aspects of 2-d signatures with some data analysis applications in mind. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/><br/>This project is concerned with relevant models in theoretical physics and image processing. A significant portion of the proposal is devoted to localization properties of the parabolic Anderson model, and a special emphasis is also put on the signature method for random fields. A more specific list of the projects at stakes is the following: (1) Moments of renormalized parabolic Anderson models. (2) Level sets for non Gaussian processes. (3) Path confinement for the continuous polymer measure. (4) 2-d signatures and failure identification. The PI plans to develop probabilistic, geometric, and analytic methods and ideas that will lead to a deeper understanding of the qualitative and quantitative of the aforementioned systems. The main techniques will combine rough paths, regularity structures and Malliavin calculus techniques, together with fundamental tools in geometry, analysis and statistical learning.

High-dimensional probability is proposed as a natural framework for the mathematical exploration of deep learning. This project has a double benefit. On the one hand, it is aimed at theoretically explaining the successes of deep learning. On the other hand, the project will inspire future theoretical developments in high-dimensional probability, especially in random matrix theory.

The Loewner energy is a quantity measuring the roundness of a simple planar loop. It arises from the asymptotic behaviors of the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), a model of random fractal curves. SLE plays a central role in random conformal geometry and two-dimensional statistical mechanics that study the macroscopic geometry of systems with given information on the microscopic level. Surprisingly, this probabilistically motivated Loewner energy can be described using fundamental concepts from seemingly disparate branches of mathematics and mathematical physics, including geometric function theory, Teichmüller theory, conformal field theory, and string theory. These links suggest deep connections between random conformal geometry and those branches. This research project aims at revealing these connections and exploring how the variety of perspectives around the Loewner energy can bring new insights to probability theory and other fields. The results are expected also to reveal new facets of the mathematical architecture underlying theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The Loewner energy of a Jordan curve is defined as the Dirichlet energy of its driving function via the Loewner differential equation. Finite energy curves can, therefore, be viewed as the Cameron-Martin space of SLE, which has a multiple of Brownian motion as driving function.  This definition of both Loewner energy and SLE depends strongly on the parametrization of the curves. However, an equivalent and intrinsic description of the Loewner energy was discovered using determinants of Laplacians and is known to be the Kähler potential of the Weil-Petersson metric on the universal Teichmüller space. This research project first aims to provide similar intrinsic descriptions of SLE loops via the canonical measures on the welding homeomorphisms, then studies generalizations of the Loewner energy to other scenarios involving multi-chords or higher genus surfaces, analytic identities inspired by results from random conformal geometry, and the relation to minimal surfaces in the hyperbolic 3-space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All these areas undergird much of science and technology. The public is familiar with probability from everyday life, but often is not aware of how crucial it is in today's economy, for example, or in today's computer algorithms in common smartphone apps. Group theory studies symmetries and lies behind much of modern physics. Analysis is familiar from calculus, invented to study moving bodies and now used throughout science and engineering. Ergodic theory is the least known of these branches of mathematics; it began in physics with the study of systems of many particles, such as gases. It now provides a unifying framework to study many disparate questions, including some in computer science. As one example of these connections to be studied, we recall that in the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.  It is always desirable to have finite approximations to infinite objects, and the same holds for infinite groups.  Gromov and Weiss suggested a way to use finite networks for this purpose, at least for those groups known as ""sofic"". It is not known how widely this approach works. The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it.  If one can actually succeed in making such approximations for all groups, then this would resolve a host of important conjectures in a variety of fields of mathematics.  The PI will continue his work on this question. Graduate students will be trained through research related to this project.<br/><br/>Other directions concern a class of random processes of points, known as determinantal.  These processes were first considered in physics, then found much use in probability theory, and recently have become of interest in computer science (in order to find representative, diverse samples from large data sets).  One of the goals of this project is to understand better how close two determinantal probability measures are when their generating matrices are close. Such a result in the finite case is very likely to extend to the infinite case as well, at least in the infinite ""sofic"" situation. In another direction, random walks are a basic object of study in probability, whether in discrete time or continuous time. The PI has discovered much very puzzling behavior of continuous-time random walks, especially on Cayley graphs. It is proposed to determine whether such puzzling behavior is limited in how much it can contradict intuition. As a final example, the notion of ""factor"" is basic to ergodic theory. Factors maps are very well understood when the acting group is amenable, but not when the group is larger. Yet factors on trees are also important in combinatorics and computer science.  It is proposed to understand better which maps are factors of IID (independent and identically distributed) processes and which are not.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although some remarkable bijections to algebraic objects such as random matrices, Young diagrams and so on have led to a series of breakthroughs in the mathematical verification of some of the predictions, many of the current techniques  based on integrable probability are not sufficient by themselves to analyze some of the fundamental geometric properties of such systems. Continuing an ongoing program to couple the integrable approach with a primarily probabilistic and geometric perspective, the PI lays down a comprehensive  plan to investigate several aspects of such models which will fundamentally improve our understanding and initiate new research directions. The program also has a strong education component including mentoring graduate students and postdocs, and curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, aiming to create multiple advanced research topics courses, and design the probability content in foundational undergraduate courses. Various educational and dissemination strategies including workshop organizing, writing survey articles, teaching summer courses will be carried out as well.  <br/><br/>A canonical model of growth predicted to be in the KPZ universality class is the model of planar Last Passage Percolation (LPP) which puts random weights on the vertices of a planar lattice and considers paths between vertices which accrue maximum weights. Such maximal paths called geodesics are fundamental objects of study. Besides further developing the picture of coalescence of geodesics in LPP models, the project aims to study the entire energy landscape of paths and their associated weights, with a focus on the geometry of almost maximal paths or near geodesics.  The PI will also investigate  interlacing properties of geodesic watermelons (collections of disjoint paths with maximal cumulative weight) and their consequences with connections to various line ensembles and determinantal point processes, as well as large deviation behaviors of geodesics. Finally the program will initiate novel research directions concerning fractal geometry and noise sensitivity, drawing inspiration from seminal works of a similar nature in the context of critical planar percolation and spin glasses. Particular topics include studying Hausdorff dimensions of  various endpoint pairs admitting exceptional geodesic behavior as well as computing exponents marking the onset of chaos in natural dynamical versions of LPP.  As necessary tools, several new theories including discrete harmonic analysis for models in the KPZ universality class will be developed. In particular, this is expected to create a bridge between various communities in probability, mathematical physics and theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These originate in physics but the methods of study require significant input from mathematics. A common feature of the problems discussed in the project is that they involve systems of many constituents. It is here where probability theory offers a number of indispensable tools. The specific questions are typically set in the context of a complex microscopic system defined in terms of mathematical concepts such as random walks or random fields. The aim is to show that, as the system size increases, a new structure emerges. This structure, sometimes called a scaling limit, often admits an independent characterization that enables its study using the methods of mathematical analysis. Particular attention is paid to the phenomenon of universality, which refers to independence of the scaling limit to the details of the underlying microscopic system. Understanding universality in its mathematically precise form is one of the overarching goals of the project. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>The project is divided roughly into two parts. The first one is focused on the study of extremal problems for spatial random fields. Drawing on earlier success of the analysis of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field, the aim is to establish universality of the conclusions for other examples of logarithmically-correlated fields such as the random walk local time or the discrete-Gaussian model below the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The interest here is on both the phenomena and the development of techniques required to control such systems. The second part of the project is devoted to the analysis of phase transitions in a number of systems of interest. One of these is a system of interacting bosons, which is proposed to be analyzed using a random-cycle representation. The aim here is to give a rigorous proof of Bose-Einstein condensation at positive temperatures in suitable scaling limits. Another model to be studied is that of interacting random walks; the aim here is to describe the limit shape using a variational problem for the walk range. The project naturally draws on recent advances in the field, some due to the PI. The techniques involved span a number of topics in probability and analysis; for instance, extreme order statistics, homogenization theory, permutation statistics, fixed point theory.

This project aims to deepen our mathematical understanding of such phenomena in several contexts, such as volumetric aspects of high-dimensional random polytopes (geometric objects with ""flat"" sides), or the sums of many random quantities in which each quantity comes with a deterministic weight. In addition to their fundamental interest, such problems are motivated by, and often find applications in, related areas of statistics, computer science, big data and machine learning. A vital part of this project is the student training and educational activities that will result. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project is devoted to three topics related to analytic, geometric and probabilistic aspects of high-dimensional phenomena: estimates for moments and tails of sums of random variables, thresholds for the volume of random polytopes, and efficient coverings of convex sets with its homothetic copies (the Hadwiger covering/illumination problem). Our work on probabilistic comparison inequalities, involving analytic and probabilistic techniques such as chaining, will help us understand the concentration of measure phenomena for random sums, with applications to the geometry of Banach spaces. Volume threshold phenomena of random polytopes in high dimensions have been established and satisfactorily understood only in the presence of a product structure or rotational symmetry. The lack of these two in our problems creates a need for new, more robust techniques and approaches. The illumination conjecture touches upon very basic concepts: coverings and intersections of convex sets.

The limiting objects, which are usually characterized by certain symmetries and spatial independence, capture the universal large-scale behavior of many models. In the last few decades, there have been great advances in random planar geometry, especially in the understanding of some fundamental two-dimensional discrete models and their scaling limits. These developments hugely expand our knowledge on the randomness of basic objects such as curves, functions, trees, and surfaces. They also revolutionize the mathematical understanding of some central pieces of physics, including conformal field theory, critical phenomena, and quantum gravity.  This project aims to broaden understanding of the fundamental mathematical underpinnings in this subject.<br/><br/>The project will explore two research directions in random planar geometry. In the first direction, the project aims at linking two ways of constructing random surfaces: (1) through the scaling limits of random planar maps; (2) through a continuous theory called the Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The investigator plans to prove a conjecture asserting that LQG is the scaling limit of random planar maps in a strong sense. As a tool for proving this conjecture, the project considers a statistical mechanical model called the critical percolation and aims to establish that the scaling limit of the critical percolation on the uniform random triangulation and on a regular triangular lattice are the same. The ingredients in both investigations include: (a) combinatorial bijections for planar maps that encode their geometric information; (b) a relation between fractals in quantum and Euclidean geometry called the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov relation; (c) the Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. In the second direction, the investigator aims to resolve questions in the geometry of random planar maps, computational geometry, and fractal geometry. The common theme in the approaches is the application of two recently-developed machineries in continuous random planar geometry called imaginary geometry and mating of trees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project supports fundamental research into mathematical models of this type, both in the two dimensional settings which have been the focus of much recent work and in higher dimensions where much less is known. In addition to the proposed research, this project includes outreach components aimed at connecting students at levels ranging from middle school to graduate school to fun mathematics in general and to the world of random growth models in particular. <br/><br/>The PI will study the structure of a class of models at the interface of rigorous statistical mechanics and probability known as random walks in random potentials, both in positive and in zero temperature.

Continuum models like the continuum directed polymer and the associated stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise will also be considered.

The study of random polynomials has applications in computer science and engineering. In addition, studying roots of high-degree polynomials is an important area of mathematics that is useful in both pure and applied sciences. The goal of this research project is to study fundamental questions concerning the distribution of roots of random polynomials and, more generally, random functions.  <br/> <br/>This project contains three research programs that address questions in the field of random functions. In the first program, the investigator plans to establish local universality for random orthogonal polynomials and derive the mean number of real roots for general distributions. The second program aims to study the variance and the Central Limit Theorem for the number of real roots of various classical models of random functions. The goal of the third program is to further the understanding of the connection between the growth of the coefficients and the growth of the number of real roots. To approach these questions, the investigator will develop the local universality method and build on different tools in analysis and probability. The project will also address several questions regarding the mixing time of Markov Chains and the phase transition of the contact process, an important model for the spread of diseases in communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The random projection of high-dimensional data is a simple and computationally efficient technique to reduce the dimensionality of a data set by trading a controlled amount of error for faster processing times and smaller model sizes.  While several properties of random projections have been studied, the question of what random projections do to outliers in the data, which appear in the tails of the data distribution, is not well understood.   This project is to rigorously characterize the tails of random projections of high-dimensional distributions. Understanding such tail behavior will also provide insight into how to distinguish between high-dimensional distributions by looking at their lower-dimensional projections.  This has potential applications in a variety of fields including computer science, data analysis, statistics, and convex geometry.  Another set of data analysis techniques used for data classification include spectral clustering and correlation clustering. Both these techniques are related to certain operator norms of associated matrices. This project will characterize the asymptotics of operator norms, in the limit of high dimensions, and study potential applications to the stability of numerical methods (for example, matrix condition number estimation) as well as clustering problems.  The project has a strong educational component, with provisions for math outreach, research training of graduate students, and development of new courses.<br/><br/>The project has two themes.  The first theme relates to the study of large deviations or the tail behavior of random projections of high-dimensional measures.  These are of interest in high-dimensional statistics and probability, as well as asymptotic convex geometry, where the object of interest is the volume or surface measure of a convex body in high dimensions.  While fluctuations of random projections have been well studied, culminating in the celebrated central limit theorem for convex sets, large deviations or tail probabilities of random projections are less well understood.  A goal of the project is to establish large deviations principles, both averaged over the direction of projection (the annealed setting) and conditioned on the direction of projection, as well as sharp large deviation estimates, and understand their ramifications for high-dimensional statistics and asymptotic convex geometry.  The second theme relates to the study of the asymptotics of operator norms for high-dimensional random matrices, which are relevant in a variety of contexts, including optimization theory, theoretical computer science and functional analysis, with applications to machine learning and data analysis.   While the two-to-two norm, which coincides with the singular value, has been well studied, the focus will be to study more general r-to-p norms, where spectral theory can no longer be used and thus will require the development of fundamentally new techniques, involving a combination of tools from algebra, analysis and probability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
