The first is to study the smoothness properties of densities for laws of solutions to hypoelliptic stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion.  The second is to continue to analyze certain finite dimensional geometric approximations to Wiener measure on a Riemannian manifold.  The eventual goal is to include the super-symmetric setting which will likely entail analysis in non-commutative probability spaces.  The P.I. expects this aspect of the project will make contact with the theory of random matrices.  The third problem is devoted to proving parabolic regularity results for heat equations on certain infinite dimensional Lie groups including loop groups.  In one way or another each of these problems may be recast (at least heuristically) as problem involving path integrals.  Many of the projects proposed here are loosely motivated by the fundamental problem of constructing quantize Yang-Mills fields.  See the Clay Mathematics Institute problem pertaining to quantized Yang - Mills fields for a description of this problem and its importance to the so called standard model in physics. <br/> <br/>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) was implicitly introduced by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1940.  (Kolmogorov seemed to have in mind possible applications to the theory of turbulence.)  A later paper by Mandelbrot and Van Ness (1968) describes a number of possible applications for fBm including using it for economic and hydrology models.  The recent literature includes applications of fBm in the modeling of neural networks, the pricing of financial instruments, and to understanding the clustering of galaxies.  One of the main projects of this proposal is to study the statistical behavior of these types of dynamical systems which are driven by fractional Brownian motion.  The P.I. will also focus on two other projects during the period of this research grant.  One of these projects is a continuation of the P.I.'s program to better understand the Feynman ""path integral"" techniques which are used in the quantum mechanical description of atomic and sub-atomic particles.  Although highly studied, the mathematical footing of Feynman's path integrals is still tenuous at best.  The third project is to generalize the results of the first two projects to ""infinite dimensions.""  It turns out that the seemingly very abstract generalization to infinite dimensions is precisely what is needed in order to understand the quantum mechanical description of the fundamental forces in nature.  (This topic goes under the heading of quantum field theory in the particle physics literature.)  It is a long standing major challenge to make mathematically rigorous sense of interacting quantum field theories.  This proposal has a significant graduate training component as a number of the problems will be tackled by the P.I.'s students."

These graphs include lattices in dimension above six, Cayley graphs of finitely generated non-amenable groups and also finite graphs such as the complete graph, the Hamming hypercube and expanders. It is believed that critical percolation on these graphs is universal in the sense that the resulting percolated clusters exhibit the same mean-field discrete fractal geometry no matter what was the original underlying high-dimensional graph. This proposal highlights various problems in different settings and is aimed to obtain a better understanding of this phenomenon. Special attention is given to determining critical exponents and studying the behavior of the random walk on percolation clusters.<br/><br/>Percolation theory has its origin in an honest applied problem, namely, the study of flow through a disordered porous medium. In the model one randomly perturbs a lattice (or other symmetric graphs) and studies the structure and geometry of the resulting random graph. This theory is a rich source of fascinating, yet simple to state, problems.<br/>Furthermore, it is a fundamental tool in the exploding research area of ""real"" networks aimed to model the behavior of real-world complex networks such as the Internet graph, routing grids, neuron networks and even social networks. Many ideas in this line of research, such as power laws and scale-free phenomenon originate in percolation theory.<br/>This proposal studies several open problems and topics in this area, hoping to deliver new techniques and methods."

The PI has been working on SLE for a number of years, and has made some important contributions to this area. The proposed project focuses on studying the geometric properties of the SLE curves of various kinds. To do this project, the PI will use the stochastic coupling technique he developed earlier. This technique is used to construct more than one SLE curve in single domain in such a way that the curves commute with each other. It was applied to prove the Duplantier's duality conjecture, the reversibility of chordal SLE and whole-plane SLE (for some parameters), and that it is possible to erase loops on a planar Brownian motion to get an SLE curve. In the proposed project, the PI will continue the application of the coupling technique. This includes constructing simple SLE loops on the Riemann sphere, proving the reversibility of the natural parametrization of SLE, and studying the behavior of SLE in multiply connected domains.  <br/><br/>The proposed research plan will give people better understanding of the behavior of the SLE curves growing in simply and multiply connected domains. This will then increase understanding of a number of two-dimensional Statistical Physics lattice models (e.g. critical percolation, critical Ising model, Gaussian free field, and loop-erased random walk) in different kinds of domains since SLE have been identified as the scaling limits of these models. The project will also have significant impacts on Conformal Field Theory.  A significant part of this proposal is its educational component. The PI will develop undergraduate courses on Probability and Complex Analysis at Michigan State University to include the newest development of the PI's research area. He will also teach specialized graduate courses on SLE, and involve graduate students in working under his supervision."

The first question deals with uniqueness.  <br/>Unless SPDE have unique solutions, they are useless for modeling.  Recent work <br/>by the proposer, L. Mytnik, and E. Perkins settled a longstanding question <br/>about uniqueness of SPDE related to the heat equation.  Using these newly <br/>developed tools, the proposer will attack uniqueness questions for other types <br/>of equations, and study uniqueness among nonnegative solutions.  The second <br/>question deals with traveling waves, which occur widely in physical systems.  <br/>Recently the proposer, L.  Mytnik, and J. Quastel have solved a problem raised <br/>by Brunet and Derrida, involving the asymptotic speed of traveling waves when <br/>the noise term is small.  The proposer will would like to extend this analysis <br/>to other equations, and related particle systems.  The third topic involves <br/>stochastic wave equations.  The most commonly studied SPDE are variants of the <br/>heat equation, but others such as the stochastic wave equation are receiving <br/>increasing attention.  With D. Geba, the proposer will like to study <br/>stochastic wave equations involving null forms.  Using some function spaces <br/>introduced by Bourgain, the proposer's goal is to study short-time existence.  <br/>The ideas developed should be relevant to other classes of equations.  <br/><br/>The field of SPDE is rapidly expanding.  As technology moves towards the micro <br/>level, the effect of random noise becomes more and more important.  Since the <br/>most important mathematical modeling tools we have are ordinary and partial <br/>differential equations, the study of SPDE is becoming essential in many <br/>applied fields.  Even though SPDE is now several decades old, the area has <br/>only recently received widespread attention.  There is still a need for <br/>pioneering work to establish a toolbox for the area.  This proposal deals with <br/>three types of problems in SPDE.  The proposer believes that through the study <br/>of such specific examples is the right way to generate methods and further our <br/>understanding, for both theory and applications.  In summary, the proposer <br/>believes that SPDE will play an essential role in future applications of <br/>mathematics.

The immediate application is to the theory of queueing networks, but other applications will be demonstrated. Measure-valued processes are finding increasing use in the modern study of stochastic systems. In particular for the study of queueing networks in the last several years, they are changing the way problems are approached.  The project will develop a novel way to unify the treatment of an important class of scaling limit results that must currently be proved one at a time using ad hoc arguments.  In the process, interesting connections to functional analysis and differential equations will be made. Several ancillary problems will be investigated as well; each of these supports the main focus of the project by providing special cases, possible avenues for generalization, or alternative areas of application.  These supporting problems are: (a) prove a diffusion limit theorem for bandwidth-sharing networks; (b) obtain fluid and diffusion limits for Least Attained Service queues; (c) study a model of social news aggregators. <br/><br/><br/>This project aims to improve the theoretical tools available for analysis of complex random systems, such as computer and telecommunication networks, social networks, and biological processes. For example, the project will produce theorems that enable a practitioner to understand the variability of congestion in a proposed computer network design. Such work has tangible benefits to society. The designs of many components of the internet for example -- switches, routing protocols, load balancing systems -- have been informed by theoretical work of this kind. In our ever more networked world, we continue to create new structures and interactions, such as the models under study in this project. There is a clear benefit to deepening our understanding of these complex systems.  The project also integrates research training activities for both graduate and undergraduate students, enhancing research infrastructure for the future."

Relevant  examples  range  from  some  in the  continuous  world  (isoperimetric  phenomena  in  convex geometry,  functional  analytic  inequalities),  to  some  in  the<br/>discrete  world  (structural  phenomena  in  additive  combinatorics), and  some  in  both  (maximum  entropy  problems  in  statistics, limit  theorems  in  probability).

The  project  will  develop  new formulations  of  extremal  problems  from  each  of  these  fields in  terms  of  information-theoretic  inequalities,  and  then  use  a variety  of  tools  from  analysis,  probability,  convex  geometry, combinatorics,  and  information  theory,  to  make  progress  on them.

These areas deal with large systems of objects, such as customers, jobs, or particles, that are connected by some random interaction rule.  He has recently also become interested in coupling problems for Brownian motion on certain bounded domains. In the area of queueing networks, an important question over the past two decades had been when such a system is stable and, when it is stable, to analyze its behavior; presently, a general theory is still lacking. The PI intends to study the behavior of several families of networks, such as those where the customer always joins the shortest queue and those connected with Internet traffic. In the area of interacting particle systems, one typically studies the evolution of large lattice-valued random systems, which model various complex random systems and exhibit a wide range of spatial behavior; they frequently occur in the context of mathematical physics and mathematical biology.  These models sometimes overlap with models involving branching random walks or with other models from mathematical physics.  The PI intends to study the behavior of a number of such models, including those for branching random walks, Gaussian free fields, and the exclusion process.  The PI  also intends to study certain properties of Brownian motion, in particular, under what conditions pairs of Brownian motions on certain bounded domains can, with positive probability, remain separated for all time.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's research is concentrated in several areas of probability theory.  He works in the area of queueing networks, where the behavior of how lines evolve is studied.  Examples include human lines (""customers"") or assembly lines for component parts (""jobs"") of a manufacturing process, for instance, the manufacture of semiconductor wafers.  When the rule by which customers or jobs are served involves multiple steps, the evolution in time of such lines can have unexpected behavior; understanding such behavior is important for designing efficient and cost-effective rules for these systems.  Much of PI's work in queueing networks is in this direction, with continuing work including systems where customers or jobs choose to join the shortest line, for instance, when shoppers pay for purchases at a supermarket.  The principal investigator also performs research in the area of interacting particle systems, where the evolution of complicated random systems is studied.  Such systems arise in physics and biology, and their components can correspond to particles, cells, or individual organisms, and may model, for instance, the spread of tumor cells. Because of the very different behavior exhibited by different systems, many aspects are currently only partially understood, and since such systems are typically too complicated to do explicit computations, a mathematical theory to understand these systems is important.  This project will study the behavior of a number of such models."

A second direction of research concerns exploiting submodularity in information theoretic as well as algorithmic contexts. On the one hand, in ongoing collaboration with M. Madiman (Yale University), the PI proposes tackling sumset and sum-product inequalities in additive combinatorics from an information theoretic point of view. On the other, new submodular linear ordering problems have been introduced in joint work with S. Iwata (Kyoto University),  offering a new perspective on classic, well-studied, hard-to-approximate linear ordering problems in combinatorics and the theory of computing.<br/><br/><br/>The full breadth of the proposed interdisciplinary research spans various topics in combinatorics, theory of computing, information theory, probability and statistical physics.  Much of the research will include collaboration with researchers from other universities as well as students from Georgia Tech. In addition to mentoring postdoctoral researchers and advising Ph.D. students, the PI has been regularly engaging undergraduate students in various research and educational projects; concrete approaches to challenging conjectures in combinatorics concerning Young tableaux and Latin partitions, as well as graph homomorphisms, form a part of the PI's research with students. The PI will continue his commitment to the dissemination of knowledge, by way of hosting and delivering research seminars, colloquia, expository lecture series as well as focused workshops. Upcoming examples include co-organizing a conference on Mathematical Challenges in Graphical Models and Message Passing Algorithms at IPAM (UCLA), and hosting a workshop on Modern Aspects of Submodularity at Georgia Tech."

In this context, a main thrust of the proposal is to develop mathematical techniques to handle complex microscopic particle interactions so that different types of macroscopic tagged particle behaviors may be captured.<br/>"

These are usually characterized by two levels of randomness, one of whom frozen (quenched), in the form of dependence graph or weights for the resulting stochastic process, whose distribution is exchangeable (hence being a mean field model).  In connection with such models we focus on the following directions. The rigorous study of probabilistic models for large systems of discrete variables that are strongly interacting according to a random graph structure.  The aim is to develop a better mathematical understanding of their phase transitions and the existence of multiple Gibbs measures. A related effort has to do with the development of  novel connections between the asymptotic behavior of the  spectrum of structured models of random matrices  and properties of the corresponding random graphs and graph embeddings.<br/>Understanding the scope and reasons behind some unexpected asymptotic behavior of stochastic dynamics for spin systems out of equilibrium. A prominent example is the aging phenomenon where memory accumulates in the system with time and its relation to a yet to be understood specific form of breakup of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (which relates the time derivative of the correlation function at equilibrium to the effect of small perturbations in Markovian dynamics).<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Over the past three decades, physicists have developed sophisticated  non-rigorous techniques for accurately predicting the asymptotic behavior of large complex random systems. Their studies were motivated by the desire to understand the collective behavior of various states of the matter, and the phase transitions connecting them. For instance, the objective of understanding water at the critical temperature at which it turns into vapor, or magnets at the critical temperature at which they lose spontaneous magnetization, has motivated the development of a sophisticated unified theory of critical phenomena.<br/>Over time, it has become apparent that the models and intuitions developed by physicists rest on deep mathematical principles, whose reach is much broader than simply physical systems. <br/>More recently, mathematicians are making significant progress in developing the corresponding rigorous theories and proving some of these predictions. Probability theory is at the forefront of this convergence, starting with the theory of large deviations and continuing with the emerging vibrant activity in the study of stochastic dynamics of interacting particles, large random matrices, Gibbs measures and planar objects with conformal symmetries.<br/><br/>This project focuses on developing this line of research, in particular to develop the mathematics of large random systems without (finite-dimensional) geometric structures. These are called by physicists `mean field systems' and enjoy a remarkable degree of universality."

The dominant theme of the research will be the effect of the network geometry on the behavior of the epidemic processes, especially near critical values of the transmission rate parameter(s). Two large classes of network geometries, Euclidean and hyperbolic, will be studied. Euclidean geometries are appropriate for models of geographically structured populations, such as plants along a river bed; here, for instance, the network might consist of individual nodes arranged in communities placed at the vertices of a regular lattice, with interactions restricted to nodes in the same or neighboring communities. Hyperbolic geometries (such as those arising in expander graphs or ?small worlds? models) are in many instances more appropriate for human populations and computer networks, where interactions do not follow a regular geographic pattern. Both finite and infinite networks will be studied. The primary objective will be the description of large-population and/or large network limiting behavior.<br/><br/>Stochastic epidemic models are closely related to a number of other large classes of stochastic processes, and these will play a large role in the research project. Epidemics of SIR type (susceptible, infected, removed) are at least in simple cases equivalent to bond percolation on the network. Epidemics of SIS type are contact processes. In Euclidean geometries, many of these processes have measure-valued scaling limits that obey stochastic partial differential equations of reaction-diffusion type. A secondary objective of the research will be to understand the threshold phenomena and phase transitions that occur in some of these related processes, and to explore how these are mirrored in epidemic models.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Epidemics -- in human and animal populations, but also in computer and communications networks -- arise from chance events. These are, in many cases, simple but uncontrollable events: A passenger on a bus might or might not touch a guard rail that has been contaminated by MIRSA bacteria; a computer user might or might not click on an attachment to an email message informing him that a wealthy businessman in Nigeria is asking for his help in transferring 30 million dollars out of the country. These chance encounters are, however, repeated in large numbers, by thousands of people, hundreds of times, and so they occur with statistically predictable frequencies. This makes it possible -- at least in principle -- to predict the course of an epidemic in a large population.<br/><br/>This research project is concerned with the study of simple mathematical models of epidemic processes. The particular emphasis of the study will be on understanding how the underlying geometry of the network of individuals or communications nodes through which the epidemic propagates affects its course."

The PI has also, together with a collaborator, shown that the thermodynamics of the focusing cubic discrete NLS are asymptotically exactly solvable in dimensions three and higher, with a transition to a new, physically concentrated phase of BEC.

One cool physical phenomenon is Bose-Einstein condensation, a state of matter close to absolute zero in which a gas of quantum particles coalesces and behaves like a giant quantum particle, with important applications to interferometry and possibly rogue waves and quantum computing.

Using branching process embeddings and local weak convergence techniques,  we propose to develop a set of robust tools that can be used to analyze one of the most important family of network models (the attachment family) which arises in a diverse range of applications. These mathematical techniques will give information on the asymptotics of not only local functionals such as degree distributions but global functionals such as the maximal degree and the spectral distribution of (random) adjacency matrices. Using continuous time branching process techniques we also propose to analyze models of network flow and first passage percolation, in order to understand the effect of disorder on the geometry of random network models and the propagation of congestion across edges in flow carrying networks. Preliminary computations suggest that for a wide array of models, macroscopic order emerges from microscopic rules of transport as the size of the network increases, and the project will attempt to understand this phenomenon and explore connections between these models and stable age distribution theory and the Malthusian rate of growth of branching process models in biology. New models of random trees motivated by statistical physics and biology will also be studied wherein using random walk constructions and conditioned branching processes, we aim to understand the scaling limits of such models. Finally we propose to develop mathematical methodology to analyze, understand and quantify sources of variation in the structure of real world complex networks such as trees arising as blood circulatory networks in the brain.<br/><br/><br/>Over the last few years the availability of empirical data on many real world networks including social networks, data transmission networks such as the Internet and various biological networks, has stimulated an explosion in the array of mathematical models proposed to understand these networks. Researchers in a wide array of fields are interested in understanding properties of such networks, the evolution and change of such networks over time, as well as the dynamics of various processes on these networks such as transporting flow or traffic through these networks and epidemic models on these networks. An understanding of the behavior of these mathematical models would allow practitioners to glean important information and insight about such processes in the real world, ranging from the design of more efficient networks, understanding the factors that influence the rate of spread of congestion of flow processes or other dynamics through the network, to the significant factors that contribute to the actual emergence of the structure of the network itself.    A mathematical analysis of such problems leads to interesting connections between these models and wide areas of mathematical probability including branching process models in biology and random fractals.  The aim of this project is to develop mathematical methodology to understand properties of such network models and in particular understand what happens when the system size grows large. At the same time the project will also develop techniques to accurately understand data arising from various biological networks such as vascular networks in the brain and the factors that significantly affect functional properties of such networks.  The techniques developed will be of use to a wide community of researchers, and we anticipate that the project will foster interdisciplinary collaborative projects with both national and international research groups and facilitate the training of students and expose them to this rapidly emerging field of research."

Many probabilists study stochastic processes. Our specialization is local times which is a measure of what are the outcomes of these processes and which outcomes are more or less likely.

The ICBSDE Symposium commenced in 1996 at the University of Paris VI, taking place every 3 years alternately in France and China.  This is the first time it will be held in the United States.  The two conferences will provide platforms for applied mathematicians, probabilists, and statisticians to present their recent work and initiate new projects.  It is also expected to foster fruitful exchanges of ideas and to encourage new interactions between the Financial Mathematics and the BSDE communities, since the two fields have had significant overlaps in recent years.<br/><br/>The proposers have made notable contributions in backward stochastic differential equations and their applications in finance, and the USC Mathematical Finance Colloquium has recently hosted many prominent researchers in both BSDEs and financial mathematics.

Several long standing problems in the theory of Forward-backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) are investigated, mainly under the non-Markovian framework, allowing less regular coefficients and arbitrary time duration. A ``User's Guide"" type result is expected. A class of quasilinear Backward Stochastic PDEs (BSPDE) is studied in the spirit of nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula, and a new type of FBSDEs with coefficients having discontinuity, arising directly from a real application, will be explored for the first time. A class of combined optimal reinsurance and investment problems with random terminal times and possible partial observations is proposed as a direct application of the newly developed results on FBSDEs. Two problems regarding credit risk models with partial information are proposed. One assumes the so-called ``Hypothesis (H)"" (or ``immersion property"") and focuses on a special BSDE with super-linear growth and exogenous jumps, with an eye on the utility optimization problems involving defaultable assets; and the other tries to understand the relationship between the conditional density and intensity of the defaults in filtering models where the Hypothesis (H) fail. The PI also proposes to investigate optimal execution problems in an ``order-driven"" market by first establishing a new model for the dynamics of the Limit Order Book (LOB) using an equilibrium density argument that results in a general type of nonlinear/random shape of the LOB. <br/><br/>The proposed research aims at resolving some of the ``last obstacles"" in the theory of FBSDEs and backward SPDEs, and some related topics in finance and insurance. The proposed projects on FBSDEs build on the results initiated by the PI and will lead to a new solution scheme to treat cases that have been open for many years, which will in turn help the proposed research on optimal reinsurance/investment and utility optimization problems involving defautable assets. The study on credit risk models with partial information and optimal liquidation problems are aiming at exploring new modeling aspects in stochastic finance. Most projects in the proposed research have direct or indirect connections to applied fields, especially stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance. Three problems are directly related to issues in finance and insurance, using the tools developed in the proposed theoretical studies, while one theoretical problem arises from a real project with a local bank in LA. Several parts of the proposed research involve Ph.D students and postdoctoral fellows. The PI will continue strengthening the connections with local financial communities through a regular Math Finance Colloquium series sponsored by the Math Finance Program at USC, for which PI is the director. Ph.D students involved in the proposed research are more likely to obtain internships from the local banks, and some might lead to permanent employment."

These graphs include lattices in dimension above six, Cayley graphs of finitely generated non-amenable groups and also finite graphs such as the complete graph, the Hamming hypercube and expanders. It is believed that critical percolation on these graphs is universal in the sense that the resulting percolated clusters exhibit the same mean-field discrete fractal geometry no matter what was the original underlying high-dimensional graph. This proposal highlights various problems in different settings and is aimed to obtain a better understanding of this phenomenon. Special attention is given to determining critical exponents and studying the behavior of the random walk on percolation clusters.<br/><br/>Percolation theory has its origin in an honest applied problem, namely, the study of flow through a disordered porous medium.

One of the basic problems of random matrix theory is to analyze the eigenvalues of large random matrices. The PI will focus on problems related to the asymptotic spectral properties of the beta ensembles, a family of models generalizing some of the most studied classical random matrix models (e.g. GOE, GUE, GSE, Wishart). The project builds on the recent results of the PI and collaborators in which the point process scaling limits of general beta ensembles are derived in the bulk of the spectrum. The proposed problems include the extension of methods to other random matrix ensembles, analyzing the limiting point processes and finding connections to the existing descriptions of classical cases. The approach relies on the study of random tridiagonal matrices which also provides a natural framework to investigate the asymptotic spectral properties of certain random Schrodinger operators. Non-rigorous physical scaling arguments suggest that a large class of one-dimensional random systems have unusual superdiffusive fluctuations with a scaling exponent of 2/3. Examples include interacting particle systems, growth models and directed polymers. These systems arise as models for various phenomena in the natural and social sciences. The recent decade brought a breakthrough from the mathematical side: for certain models the fluctuation exponent has been determined rigorously and in some cases even scaling limits have been proved. The PI will work towards extending the rigorous results to a wider family of models. In particular the fluctuation theory of certain lattice gases, directed polymer models and self avoiding processes will be studied.<br/><br/>The problems considered in the proposal deal with the analysis of systems with a large number of random components with complex interactions. We might understand the joint distribution of the entries of a large random matrix, but the distribution of the eigenvalues is usually a lot more complicated. The evolution of an interacting particle system might be simple on a local level, and we might understand the behavior of the fluctuations for a fixed time, but the scaling limit of the fluctuation field may be a highly non-trivial object. The goal of the proposal is to develop new tools and to provide a better understanding for such problems. The educational part of the proposal focuses on enhancing undergraduate and graduate probability education at the PI's host institution and actively involving graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the PI's area of research."

(2) What kinds of computational tasks can be performed in a distributed system with no central control over timing? (3) What kinds of algebraic invariants can help distinguish between nonisomorphic graphs?  Abelian networks tie these three questions together: From a dynamical point of view, an abelian network is a cellular automaton that produces complex patterns using local rules. From a computational point of view, an abelian network yields the same output regardless of the timing of events at its individual nodes. And from an algebraic point of view, an abelian network associates an invariant, in the form of an abelian group or commutative algebra, to its underlying graph.<br/><br/>What can a network of computers reliably accomplish if each computer in the network runs at a different and unpredictable speed?  Answering this question would bring us closer to understanding complex networks like the brain, the economy and the internet. A related question asks what kinds of patterns can arise from simple interacting components in a situation where the order of interactions does not matter. A better understanding of pattern formation would aid in engineering desired large-scale outcomes by modifying only small-scale features of a system.  This kind of problem arises, for example, in designing a road network to minimize traffic delays and in using nanotechnology to engineer stronger materials."

These are positive real valued processes that include processes that  are the squares of Gaussian processes. However, whereas Gaussian processes are defined by a positive definite symmetric covariance function, in the definition of permanental processes, the restrictions to symmetry and positive definiteness are  not required. Permanental process are the missing link that can be used to extend the Dynkin Isomorphism Theorem to an isomorphism theorem that contains the local times of Markov processes that do not have symmetric potential densities. They also plan to extend the study of permanental processes to permanental fields and to develop  new isomorphism theorems that relate them to continuous additive functionals and intersection local times of   general Markov processes. They expect to be able to use them  to obtain sample path properties of continuous additive functionals and intersection local times.  <br/><br/>Important phenomena in our lives, like weather, financial markets, voting patterns and detection of enemy activity are so complex that they can only be modeled as random events called stochastic processes. Nevertheless, although these events are random, they all have certain structures, usually different, that enables us to make good predictions about how they behave, so that we can exploit them or defend ourselves against them. Many probabilists study stochastic processes. Our specialization is local times which is a measure of what are the outcomes of these processes and which outcomes are more or less likely. Our motivation is twofold. One is esthetic, because the underlying mathematics is very beautiful. The other is practical, to provide tools for engineers and scientists engaged in protecting us from devastating weather, controlling destructive market fluctuations, analyzing voter patterns, protecting us from enemy missles...the list of potential applications is endless.

Problems involving these complex structures involve understanding the behavior of sums of spatially dependent terms having short range interactions, but complicated long range dependence. Problems of interest in discrete stochastic geometry involve functionals of convex hulls of i.i.d. samples, asymptotic quantization error,  the limit behavior of  maximal points, and  the limit behavior of generalized tessellations in Euclidean space. Problems of interest involving spatial data include dimension estimation of non-linear data clouds embedded in a high dimensional Euclidean space, estimation of entropy, estimation of surface and volume integrals, as well as establishing minimal cost networks for data transmission and energy scaling laws. In each case, one seeks to quantify the `mean' or average behavior of functionals arising in these problems.   A chief goal is to show that  sums of spatially dependent terms behave as though they were sums of independent identically distributed random variables.  One thus wants to show that such sums  satisfy laws of large numbers, that they have asymptotically a normal distribution, and that the random point measures defined by these sums satisfy functional central limit theorems, that is to say show their scaling behavior is understood in terms of Brownian sheets.<br/><br/>This project aims to solve  problems in geometric probability which are of interest to researchers in both industry and academia. Examples include the following:<br/>  (i)  given an unknown object or body (such as an infarction in the human body or an underground deposit of oil) how can we use effectively use random probes of the object to find reliable estimators of its surface area and volume?<br/>  (ii) given a huge amount of spatial data, how do we use only the interpoint distances of the data to determine intrinsic properties of the data, including its intrinsic dimension?  (iii)  given a network such as the world wide web, how does one best find ways to efficiently transmit and route information through it, minimizing cost and travel time? Similarly, given a communication network, how does one optimally place transmitters to maximize coverage?<br/>(iv) given any complex network, including airline and other transportation networks, how does one efficiently route vehicles to maximize<br/>revenue?

The investigator's research concerns stochastic and deterministic models associated with the evolution of  gases, the formation of gels and crystals, and Hamiltonian systems with random potentials. As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. Roughly, after a suitable scaling, the density of particles in a gas with grazing collisions converges to a solution of Landau Equation,  a rough interface modeled by Hamilton-Jacobi PDE with impurity homogenizes to a homogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and a chain of particles with random potential are governed by an effective potential. Many issues related to these models are not fully understood. Large-deviations type questions for the homogenization and a central limit theorem type result for gases would provide us with valuable information about the corresponding microscopic models. Also, simplified models for coagulation phenomenon should help us to discover the rules governing the mysterious interaction between gels and sols.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale?  Roughly the reason is that the local conservation laws impose constraints not immediately visible on the microscopic scale. As an another example, consider a solid  to which further material sticks from the ambient atmosphere.  The process of the attachment is a function of a huge variety of growth mechanisms depending on the materials involved, their temperature, composition, etc. Following the tradition of statistical mechanics, one studies simplified models which nevertheless captures some of the essential physics.<br/><br/>The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids, gases and crystals. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of components is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of our microscopic world such as the formation of crystals, the emergence of clots in blood, the roughness of the surface boundary of solids and occurrence of shocks in fluids."

A unified picture, describing the limit of this model as random curves and fields, capturing subtle geometry and boundary conditions effects, seems to be rigorously obtainable. This picture will also deepen the comprehension of other models and offer many applications.<br/><br/>Phase transitions are abrupt changes in the nature of systems: vapor that suddently condensates into water, metals that gain supraconductivity, social networks whose activity explode once critical mass has been reached. A major question is to understand how such global-scale phase transitions occur in large systems. We plan to develop tools and techniques to study models where random macroscopic geometries arise. Such models have found applications for instance in chemistry, image processing, ecology, economics or machine learning. Thanks to new ideas and methods introduced in the recent years, it now appears possible to give a more complete description of the phase transition of such models, which will hopefully become useful tools for both theoretical and applied researchers."

The common feature of these is a relatively simple formulation, intriguing underlying phenomena and deep connections to physical disciplines. The first round of problems pertains to the Random Conductance Model. These include derivation of scaling limits of random walks in disordered media, study of spectral properties of random Laplacians, analysis of fluctuations of effective conductivity, detailed control of heat-kernel decay, etc. The second area proposed to investigate is that of Gradient Fields. These problems are ubiquitous in physical and applied sciences but their mathematical understanding is currently stalled because of the inability to overcome non-convexity of the underlying interaction. We offer specific methods and approaches how this obstacle may technically be overcome. The third class of problems addresses the area of Disordered Systems. The specific subjects of interest are random-field spin models and the dynamics governed by the parabolic Anderson model. Precise mathematical approaches are outlined that could lead to significant improvements in the mathematical understanding of these problems. A good many of listed problems are devised with the intention to provide training, and inclusion in research, of graduate students and postdocs who have interest in Probability Theory and Mathematical Physics.<br/><br/>The tremendous success of hard sciences in accurate description, modeling and even forecasting complex natural phenomena derives, in large part, from their foundation in rigorous mathematics. In the context of solid-state physics and material sciences, the mathematical methods most commonly used are those of probability and/or statistics. This comes as no surprise as these disciplines have been designed precisely to deal with systems involving large numbers of individual constituents. The present project studies three specific classes of problems in probability theory of large systems whose origin is rooted in physics of materials. The most pertinent general question we ask is how the structural details of materials, and their various inherent irregularities, exactly express themselves in their macroscopic properties. As a rule, we seek an enveloping principle, or a ""physical law"", that extracts, in quantitative or qualitative form, the essential features from the specifics. It is hoped that developing the theoretical foundations of such systems will eventually lead to significant advances in engineering applications. There is also an immediate impact for mathematics itself: analysis of complex phenomena inevitably involves a number of separate sub-disciplines of mathematics and will thus lead to fruitful exchange of ideas among them. The project naturally offers an opportunity to include graduate students and postdocs into the research environment at a top research US university."
