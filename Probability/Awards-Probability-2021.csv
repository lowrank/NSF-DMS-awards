A central objective is the analysis of stochastic partial differential equations, such as the heat and wave equations, perturbed by random noises. These equations  provide mathematical models in a wide range of areas, such as growth models for interfaces, turbulence in fluid dynamics and polymer models. The proposed research will focus on the ergodicity and random fluctuations of spatial averages, which are related to observed characteristics in particular physical models.  A second objective of the project is to broaden the range of applications of the stochastic calculus of variations, also called Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin calculus is a mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of variations from functions to stochastic processes. It has proven to be a powerful tool in deriving rates of convergence in central limit theorems, which are of great relevance in statistical inference. Particular emphasis will be put in the analysis of random processes with long memory which are useful to handle data coming from finance, telecommunications and other areas. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>A first working block of the project consists in establishing  quantitative central limit theorems for spatial averages of a wide class of stochastic partial differential equations driven by a Gaussian noise which has homogeneous covariance. Challenging problems are the case of the three dimensional wave equation driven by a noise which is white in time and it has a Riesz covariance in space, and also the case of noises which are rougher that the white noise. Establishing the rate for probability densities using techniques of Malliavin calculus is  a central goal of the project. A second working block deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of functionals of the fractional Brownian motion related to local times. An innovative methodology based on the Clark-Ocone formula will be developed. In a third working block we plan to  address several open problems  in the applications of the stochastic calculus of variation in limit problems including local asymptotic expansions of densities and rates of convergence for Euler approximations in stochastic Volterra equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Why then does the world around us appear to be so predictable? This is explained in a very general context by a principle known as concentration of measure: smooth functions of many independent random variables behave in an essentially predictable manner. Precise mathematical formulations of this phenomenon provide powerful tools for studying complex random structures. This project aims to study new concentration phenomena that arise from unexpected connections with several different areas of mathematics: from the study of embeddings (how well can data be represented in a particular space?); from the study of exotic shapes which date back to old problems in geometry from over a century ago; and from the study of non homogeneous random matrices, which are widely used in modern data science. The unusual features of these problems motivate the development of the theory in new directions, as well as the introduction of new tools that may be applied to a wide range of random structures that arise in both pure and applied mathematics. The project includes educational, mentoring and outreach activities that are aimed at attracting and training the next generation of mathematicians, and at increasing participation and diversity in the mathematical sciences. It also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The aim of this project is to systematically develop novel concentration phenomena that arise from problems in probability, functional analysis, metric geometry, and convex geometry. The project is organized around three topics. The first topic aims to develop a general theory of concentration inequalities for functions taking values in normed spaces. The second topic aims to understand certain long-standing questions in convex geometry that may be viewed as unusual analogues of the concentration phenomenon. The third topic is concerned with concentration inequalities for the norms of non-homogeneous random matrices. The investigation of concentration phenomena in nonstandard settings motivates new questions and the development of new tools that are both of direct probabilistic significance, and that provide new perspectives on problems in other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Determinants of random matrices also serve as tools for the analysis of many high-dimensional random functions. Applications include criteria for the possibility of optimization of loss functions in deep learning. More recently, a new connection has emerged, a hierarchical structure behind the eigenvalues of random matrices and L-functions, their extremes being characterized by analogy with branching processes. This project will extend and combine recent methods developed for these random matrix spectral and hierarchical universalities to enlarge their scope,  and apply these techniques to random landscapes. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will first work on universal connections between random matrices, branching processes, L-functions and gaussian multiplicative chaos, by studying the Fyodorov-Keating conjectures up to tightness of the maximum,  their universality in the class of Wigner matrices and beta ensembles, and the emergence of the 2d Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures from the characteristic polynomial of random normal matrices.

This project  aims to study a variety of problems addressing fundamental features of some of the most canonical interacting spin systems at low temperature. Specific models to be studied include the three dimensional Ising model (one of the most fundamental models in statistical mechanics) and the (2+1) dimensional Solid-On-Solid model. One feature that these models exhibit is the entropic repulsion, where an initially flat surface goes through a series of meta-stable states as it builds its height towards equilibrium. The main focus of this project is to study the entropic repulsion phenomenon for these models and its interplay with Glauber dynamics (the natural stochastic process that models the evolution of the system). To advance understanding of these problems the project will develop new methods in probability theory which would find applications in other studies of interacting spins systems. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The first research project focuses on the 3D Ising model at low temperature on an infinite cylinder, with mixed boundary conditions?minus above height 0 and plus elsewhere. These give rise rise to an interface, a random surface separating the plus/minus phases, and the PI aims to study the entropic repulsion effect conditioned on this interface being positive. The main goal is to show that, in order to gain entropy, the surface gradually rises, and its level lines eventually form a single plateau with an a.s. scaling limit given by a Wulff shape; the level line exhibit cube-root fluctuations away from the boundary; and started at a flat initial state, the evolution of the surface towards equilibrium goes through a sequence of meta-stable plateaus, each with a waiting time doubly-exponential in its height. A related research direction aims to study a class of crystal models that approximate 3D Ising, and show that the scaling limit in terms of a Wulff shape and cube-root fluctuations are universal for that entire class. For the (2+1)D Solid-On-Solid, the goal is to refine our understanding and obtain the order of the fluctuations in the top level line. The final topic to be studied concerns crystal models such as Solid-On-Solid at low temperature when the boundary condition is tilted, which is known to cause the (otherwise flat) surface to become de-localized. Here the goal is to give quantitative bounds on the height fluctuations, and show that Glauber dynamics is no longer exponentially slow due to meta-stable states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Random matrices naturally appear in problems within computer science, statistics, and mathematical physics. Studying random matrices enables one to develop better tools to analyze data, to understand properties of complex quantum systems, and to estimate performance of algorithms. The Principal Investigator (PI) will consider various models of random matrices with the goal of obtaining results that hold with very high probability. Graphs (collections of points connected by edges) have been extensively used as models of communication networks and of data organization. For example, social networks and the World Wide Web can be efficiently modeled as random graphs. Understanding characteristics of random walks on graphs helps to evaluate the speed of information exchange in networks. Moreover, random walks on certain graphs have been used for sampling, that is, constructing typical instances of complex objects. The PI will study properties of random walks on graphs by employing tools of functional analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>The two main parts of this research are analysis of singular spectrum and eigenvalues of certain models of square random matrices, and functional inequalities on graphs. The PI will focus on studying the singularity probability of random square matrices, which is of interest in numerical analysis and combinatorics. Further, the PI will consider limiting laws for the spectrum of random matrices for previously unexplored models. The tools developed as part of this research should find applications in other problems within combinatorial and non-asymptotic random matrix theory. Secondly, the PI will apply functional analytic tools to study concentration and mixing on various graphs, including spaces of regular graphs, and Catalan structures. The goal of this part of the project is to obtain sharp estimates for mixing and relaxation times for random walks on those graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematicians call those tables matrices, and try to find hidden structure within them.  One such hidden signature is a list of numbers called eigenvalues that describes some of the properties of the larger matrix of numbers.  Eigenvalues not only summarize the information in a large array; they can reveal information that was hidden from plain view, through ubiquitous tools like principal component analysis that statisticians have used to great effect for decades.  The main purpose of this proposal is to explore promising new computational tools to understand the behavior of eigenvalues of very large matrices lacking any overall symmetry.  The PI and his team have discovered new and surprising connections between several different mathematical fields of study that can be used to compute the large-scale behavior of the eigenvalues of such symmetry-free matrices, opening the door to solve problems that have remained inaccessible for decades.  As a new methodology, there is much to explore including low-hanging fruit that is perfectly suited to research by Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers.  Funds will be used to develop these computational tools in collaboration with colleagues and postdoctoral researchers, and will support the research of a diverse body of Ph.D. students ? both developing their research skills to prepare them for academic or technical careers, and furthering the research goals of the project.<br/><br/>This project will address questions relating operator theory, stochastic differential equations, diffusion on Lie groups, and random matrix theory.

These arise naturally as the high-dimension limits of random matrix models that appear in wireless communication and information theory, as well as throughout geometry and analysis in pure mathematics.

For example, in the former case, diffusion limited aggregation processes produce intricate fractals through processes analogous to those that drive the formation of corals, but the propensity of these processes to give rise to long, spiny, structures is still not rigorously understood.  In the latter case, the Abelian sandpile process builds a cluster of particles through a pseudorandom distribution of particles that ends up giving rise to intricate fractal patterns, as well as statistical laws which reappear throughout nature (e.g., as the frequency distributions of earthquakes, avalanches, etc).<br/><br/>Among other goals, this project aims to better understand the dependence of the behavior of the Abelian sandpile on the underlying lattice.

To better understand such systems, much attention has been paid to how, for example in a bacterial colony, the boundary of the  region occupied by the colony changes over time. Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ) proposed that a stochastic partial differential equation could be used to describe the evolution of these boundaries.

A matching problem involves associating with each data point in one set (say patients), exactly one data point in another set (say hospitals). There is a cost incurred for this match to occur (say the distance the patient needs to travel to get to the hospital). An optimal matching is one that minimizes the average cost. The mathematics of Monge Kantorovich OT has grown to be a unifying theme in many scientific disciplines, from purely mathematical areas such as analysis, geometry, and partial differential equations to revolutionary new methods in economics, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. For example, the impact of optimal transport in the study of geometric inequalities and Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry was highlighted by two Fields medals (Villani 2010, Figalli 2018) in the last decade. On the other hand OT has established itself as a viable alternative to classical maximum likelihood based methods in analyzing high-dimensional data coming from a manifold. Other notable applications include analysis of neural networks and adversarial networks in machine learning and artificial intelligence, new applications to stem cell biology, and economic applications such as generalizations of the Nobel prize winning Gale-Shapely algorithm, online auctions, and option pricing. Much of these are due to impressive leaps in computational methods in OT that hinge on entropy based regularizations. This project focuses on new probability questions in this area of entropic regularization of optimal transport problems and their applications. The project also provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes problems at the intersection of probability and Monge-Kantorovich OT that are broad and cut across several mathematical and applied disciplines. It brings new probabilistic tools and perspectives (such as exchangeability, Gaussian chaos expansions, Metropolis algorithm, mean-field particle interactions) to problems of mass transport that are of interest to statisticians, computer scientists, analysts and geometers. The primary focus is on the asymptotic analysis of both discrete and continuous entropy-regularized OT, also called Schroedinger bridges, either as the temperature goes to zero or as the data size goes to infinity or both. One of the proposed problems involves Markov chain based computational method for OT, which, if resolved, will have immediate applications to various applied disciplines that depend on OT computations. Other applications involve analysis of transaction costs in mathematical finance and robotics where the dynamics of a large number of interacting drones is described by a novel McKean-Vlasov type limit. A large mathematical audience will find the material close to their interests and the project is expected to spur further cross-disciplinary collaborations between probabilists and non-probabilists working in OT. This is also facilitated by the PI-led PIMS Kantorovich Initiative that creates an infrastructure for interdisciplinary work based on OT located in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CLT approximation is a cornerstone of statistical inference, as it provides the theoretical underpinning of the vast majority of statistical methods for estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. It is also routinely used for uncertainty assessment across the sciences and in many industrial applications. Despite the immense popularity, most existing CLT results are unable to fully express mathematically the degree of complexity that is typical of modern, large datasets. In addition, they are inadequate for high-dimensional statistical modeling. As a result, reliance on classic CLT approximations to verify the validity of statistical procedures is no longer justifiable in high-dimensional settings. Instead, new, more refined CLT guarantees are in order. Recent breakthrough advances have led to the formulation of new high-dimensional CLTs (HDCLTs), whose validity holds but only under fairly restrictive assumptions. The broad goal of this project is to develop new HDCLT approximations that are applicable across a significantly wider range of conditions and settings and to elucidate their uses in high-dimensional statistical problems involving large and complex data.<br/><br/>The research components of this project include five main research aims: (1) to produce HDCLTs for independent observations under weak conditions that allow for heavy-tail data and singular covariances; (2) to derive new high-dimensional Edgeworth expansions; (3) to obtain new HDCLTs for sums of dependent random vectors and time series processes; (4) to study HDCLTs for high-dimensional random matrices, such as the sample covariance matrix, and their spectra; and (5) to deploy HDCLTs in multiple-testing problems targeting FDR and FWER control.

The primary research goal of the project is to show that certain classical random planar map models converge to LQG in the scaling limit, laying a mathematical foundation for this physical picture. The two most challenging cases are when the random geometry is non-uniform or when the underlying surface is non-simply-connected. The project aims to address open questions in both cases. Besides the geometric aspect, the correlation functions of Liouville CFT possess deep algebraic structures, which are expected to be computed by a schematic program called the conformal bootstrap. Another major goal of the research is to rigorously establish the conformal bootstrap program for Liouville CFT. To achieve these goals, the PI will rely on the rich interplay between LQG and a family of random planar curves called the Schramm-Loewner evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems can be used to describe chemical reactions, as well as the spread of disease, information, and species through a network. These models often become more meaningful when multiple particle types are incorporated. For example, the celebrated First Passage Percolation model describes the spread of a single species through an environment; the incorporation of competing species enriches the model. This project seeks to study more realistic variants of well-known models for chemical reactions, epidemic outbreaks, and the spread of information as to deepen our understanding of important phenomena from across the sciences and further develop the mathematics that helps explain them. The project will involve the undergraduate students training.<br/><br/>This project will consider five different stochastic multi-type interacting particle systems: (1) The Diffusion-Limited Annihilation model is an annihilating particle system in which collisions between opposite type particles result in mutual annihilation. The version in which particles have different speeds is difficult to study and conjectured to exhibit anomalous behavior when different particle types are initially balanced. (2) The Ballistic Annihilation model has three particle types and all collisions result in annihilation. The limiting particle density in different regimes will be characterized. (3) The Chase-Escape model is a competitive stochastic growth model conjectured to have a coexistence phase even when the predatory species is fitter than the prey. The effect of the environment and fitness of the different species on coexistence will be investigated. (4) The A+B->2A model describes a growing system of infected particles. This process was recently generalized to the continuum, which leads to several new questions at the intersection of discrete and continuous probability, which will be addressed. (5) Lastly, the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model is well-understood on random graphs near the critical connectivity threshold. A natural extension is to have susceptible individuals rewire their connections away from infected individuals. This more realistic modification may change the size of epidemics.

The first models of this kind, so-called free boundary problems, were proposed as early as 1831 and became ubiquitous across science and engineering in the second half of the 20th century. Despite the considerable attention devoted to free boundary problems, the understanding of the solutions they generate is still very limited. In this project, the investigator will use a novel approach on free boundary problems, grounded in modern probability theory to advance the understanding of this important class of mathematical models. A particular focus of the project will be on the desirable irregularities present in these models capturing, for example, the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, as well as the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. Integral parts of the project are supervision of graduate and undergraduate research, and graduate and undergraduate training in probability theory and stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems provide a universal mathematical framework for many phenomena in the natural and social sciences as well as engineering. While the mathematical formulation of free boundary problems dates back to the 19th century and their analysis has received much attention in the 20th century, the understanding of their solutions is still limited. This is largely due to the singularities oftentimes exhibited by the solutions, either in time, capturing for example the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, or in space, encapsulating for example the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. This project builds on the analysis for the one phase supercooled Stefan problem in one space dimension, a prototypical example of a singular free boundary problem. The aim is to expand the scope of the novel probabilistic solution concept they introduced to include a large set of singular free boundary problems, such as the one phase supercooled Stefan problem for the nonlinear heat equation and its two-phase analogue in one space dimension, the supercooled Stefan problem in multiple space dimensions, possibly with kinetic undercooling and/or surface tension, and the Hele-Shaw problem in multiple space dimensions.

Queueing models are probabilistic models that capture the inherent randomness in a variety of modern networks, such as those that arise in customer service systems, computing and telecommunications, transportation, and hi-tech manufacturing.  The network structure is typically deterministic, and the scheduling policy is usually specified.  Randomness results from exogenous arrival times, service times, and internal routing.  Feedback and non-head-of-the-line scheduling policies are common in such networks.  These local dynamics interact to produce aggregate behavior that is complex and often evades closed form analysis.  Hence, tractable approximations are needed.  In this project the PI will specify and validate various model approximations, analyzing their performance and/or optimal control, and interpreting those results for the original system. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project concerns the study of three queueing models operating under general distributional assumptions with distinct features presenting unique mathematical challenges as follows: (1) Develop a diffusion approximation for networks of processor sharing queues in the presence of feedback; (2) Obtain asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for multi-class many server queues with abandonment through the study of fluid and diffusion control problems; and (3) Prove limit theorems to justify fluid invariant states as approximations of stationary distributions for randomize load balancing algorithms. These models have been analyzed in various forms that include Markovian distributional assumptions, i.e., exponentially distributed inter-arrival, service, and/or abandonment times. However, such assumptions are not particularly realistic for modeling the behavior of modern computers, communications, and customer service systems. Furthermore, the performance can be dramatically different for such systems in the presence of non-Markovian distributional assumptions. Therefore, system performance needs to be understood more fully. From a mathematical point of view, general distributional assumptions result in the need to track significantly more information in order to represent the system state. For example, residual service times, age-in-service, and/or age-in-system must be tracked for each job in the system. This leads to an infinite dimensional system where measure-valued state descriptors provide an effective representation. Despite this common descriptor, the mathematical challenges are different for each model due to distinct system dynamics. For processor sharing networks, a new methodology for analyzing the long-time behavior of fluid model solutions will be developed. It is anticipated that this methodology will translate to other systems where time sharing is present. For the control of multi-class queues, non-linearity that arises in the fluid control problem for non-exponentially distributed abandonment times presents new challenges for demonstrating asymptotic optimality. Such non-linearities are expected to introduce further difficulties to be overcome in the analysis of a second order, diffusion control problem. For randomized load balancing algorithms, a methodology for proving the convergence of fluid model solutions to invariant states as time approaches infinity will be developed. A challenge here is to devise strategies equipped to handle the countable system of couple measure-valued equations satisfied by fluid model solutions. Such strategies are expected to be relevant for the analysis of other models with load balancing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These distributions are known to model the impact of highly consequential events that may be difficult to hedge against, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, wildfires, economic shocks, among many others.  In turn, Bayesian methods encompass the body of statistical theory that explains how to combine observed evidence with subjective beliefs. Despite the importance of the applications mentioned earlier, most of the computational methods for Bayesian inference are typically designed to efficiently study light-tailed distributions, which model events that are in some sense easier to hedge against. The project's goal is to study questions that lie at the heart of the convergence speed of computational methods for Bayesian inference with heavy-tailed target distributions. The methods studied in this project will provide the tools to design faster and more efficient algorithms to accurately predict high impact events such as those described above. Successfully enabling efficient and systematic Bayesian inference for heavy-tailed targets requires a breadth of expertise and research experience which would be very difficult to assemble within a single project without the DMS-EPSRC Lead Agency agreement. The results obtained in this proposal will be introduced in courses that will enhance broadening participation. The PI will attempt to recruit personnel from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is the study of the convergence analysis to equilibrium of Markov chains which exhibit heavy-tailed features. While this goal is theoretical in nature, its motivation comes from applications: the existing theory does not apply to randomized Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms with heavy-tailed targets, which nevertheless arise frequently in practice. Despite the fundamental importance of convergence to equilibrium analysis, there are important questions that have not been well studied in the literature. For instance, the presence of a spectral gap is known to be equivalent to the geometric convergence of a Markov chain. However, even under geometric convergence, ergodic estimators may still exhibit large deviation behavior of the heavy-tailed type for standard empirical means. Contributions in this direction will significantly extend the Donsker-Varadhan theory of large deviations (which is fundamental in probability). Conversely, Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures typically do not have a spectral gap but might nevertheless exhibit good convergence properties. Designing quickly convergence Markov chains requires dynamics that are completely different from the standard Langevin diffusion typically used in MCMC. The PI will investigate and build a systematic theoretical treatment of the convergence to equilibrium of Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures arising in randomized algorithms of computational statistics and machine learning (ML).  This project will involve students and a postdoctoral associates who will visit the research teams both in the US in the UK. This will further enhance the human resource development of these participants since they will be exposed to a broad network of collaborators and ideas.

The last twenty years have seen a renaissance in our understanding of mathematical models of these phenomena, particularly in two space-time dimensions where many such models are conjectured (and sometimes proven) to have the same statistical properties. This project supports fundamental research into mathematical models of this type, both in the two dimensional settings which have been the focus of much recent work and in higher dimensions where much less is known. In addition to the proposed research, this project includes outreach components aimed at connecting students at levels ranging from middle school to graduate school to fun mathematics in general and to the world of random growth models in particular. <br/><br/>The PI will study the structure of a class of models at the interface of rigorous statistical mechanics and probability known as random walks in random potentials, both in positive and in zero temperature. This class of models is broad. On the lattice, it includes first passage percolation and directed last passage percolation, directed polymers in random media, as well as random walks in both static and dynamic random environments, with general admissible steps. Continuum models like the continuum directed polymer and the associated stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise will also be considered. The main goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the infinite volume structure of such models through specific examples and to work toward a unified treatment of that structure in the greatest generality that can be achieved.  Concretely, the main goal of the project will be to characterize the existence and uniqueness properties of semi-infinite and bi-infinite volume measures (respectively geodesics). The work will also consider related problems, including investigating how infinite volume measures relate to the regularity properties of the limiting free energy (respectively shape function), developing computational tools in exactly solvable models and on understanding the structure of the environment viewed from the perspective of paths drawn from the infinite volume measure (respectively a geodesic).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The activity aims at investigating the evolution of systems with complex interactions, such as particles moving in a disordered environment, cars navigating their way through traffic, the surface of a growing crystal, or the boundary of an infected tissue. Complexity is captured by the randomness in the model, both in the environment in which the particles interact or the crystal grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim of the project is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To have a simple example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of heads in a large number of tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of getting heads in one toss. Besides its impact on probability theory and mathematics in general, the project will have a direct impact on the understanding of many physical systems involving motion in random or disordered media. Understanding complex interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for society. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>This research is on the subject of random motion in random media. In his recent work, the PI has focused on the study of random polymer models, both in positive and zero temperature. The overarching theme was establishing energy-entropy duality, producing solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions, then using these solutions to describe the large-volume systems. The PI already constructed the Busemann functions in a variety of models and used them to analyze infinite geodesics (or Gibbs measures, in the positive temperature case), establish one-force one-solution principles, and study the stability and instability of the related dynamical systems. In this project, the PI will work on extending these results to a quite general setting that will cover zero and positive temperature, directed and undirected, discrete and continuous, as well as higher-dimensional models. The PI will also develop methods to use Busemann functions to study the regularity of the limiting shape function, prove localization, study the size of the polymer and shape fluctuations, and, for random walk in random environment, describe the structure of the Martin boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference schedule will be similar to that in recent meetings: There will be 7 one-hour plenary lectures, as well as 15-20 twenty-minute lectures. At least two of the plenary presentations will be dedicated to deep applications of probability theory in other important and exciting, as well as possibly-emerging, scientific disciplines. The conference is expected to host 70-80 participants in FDP 2020. Seven distinguished mathematicians, at the forefront of several different areas with probability and its applications, have accepted invitations to give plenary one-hour talks. The 20-minutes lectures are made to encourage early career researchers, women, and minority-group representatives to speak and showcase their work.
