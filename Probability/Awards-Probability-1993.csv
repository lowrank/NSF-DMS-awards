This will allow  the investigator to develop the principle of random averaging for  systems in general spaces and types of perturbations and to  establish theorems on weak convergence of the distributions of a  perturbed system for large times to distributions of a diffusion  Markov process.  The methods of investigation are based on  martingale theory, stochastic differential equations for complex  systems, and limit theorems for stochastic differential  equations.  The investigator will consider new general limit  theorems for jump processes in extending phase spaces to study  the weak convergence of complex Markov processes to more simple  ones.

The ultimate goal is to                   contribute to the understanding of statistical behavior in                      nonconformal expansive and hyperbolic dynamical systems,                        especially as it relates to the ""fractal"" geometry of repellers.                The more immediate aim is to elucidate the structure of                         self-affine sets,e.g., the relationship between Hausdorff and                   Bouligand dimensions and the natural dynamical systems associated               with such sets.  For this a better understanding of random matrix               products, especially their large deviations, seems essential. The               study of random matrix products, in turn, leads to questions                    concerning random walks on nonabelian groups and the theory of                  Gibbs measures and thermodynamic formalism: in particular, a                    significant component of the research effort will be directed to                producing accurate approximations to the transition probabilities               of random walks on discrete groups and semigroups, and developing               a theory of Ruelle-like operators appropriate for this purpose.                      Investigations into the behavior of certain chaotic                        dynamical systems will be conducted, in particular, those in                    which the phase space is stretched at different rates in                        different directions.  Unusual geometric objects that arise in                  the ""phase spaces"" of these dynamical systems, called                           ""repellers,"" and their connections with the nature of the                       dynamics will be closely studied.  The theory of probability                    predominates in these investigations: questions involving the                   behavior of ""typical"" orbits are studied by choosing an initial                 state of the system ""at random."" This viewpoint leads to related                problems in probability theory proper, mostly concerned with                    certain features of random walks on state spaces with a highly                  noneuclidean geometry (""matrix groups"")."

It deals with optimal control of diffusion                  processes by means of a free boundary, as well as optimal control               at a reflection boundary of the stochastic process. This type of                control naturally appears in problems in which there is no                      natural restriction on the rates of control and the optimal                     control rate id infinite. The optimal policy is then to reflect                 the process from the a priori unknown boundary. Such type of                    action arises in problems with additive control, where there are                no a priori limits on the control rates. It is intended to                      develop of the related partial differential equations with                      gradient constraints, to study optimal reflection barriers in                   multi-dimensional cases and to investigate other problems                       pertinent to singular control in queuing, inventory and flexible                manufacturing models.                                                                The proposed research lies within the area of optimal                      stochastic control. This type of control problem arises in models               involving automatic cruise control of an airplane subject to                    uncertain wind conditions, of a space vehicle subject to small                  perturbations in mechanical units. The solution to this problem                 suggests the optimal timing of the correction of the course of                  the airplane of the space vehicle. Singular control also appears                in queuing/production/manufacturing models. In a typical model of               a flexible manufacturing system one seeks the optimal scheduling                of turning on and off the production unit, the timing of buying                 new equipment or increasing the capacity of the existing unit,                  finding optimal levels of inventory stocked for supply, etc. In                 many cases when the production process faces uncertainties due to               fluctuation of demand or due to unreliability in the process                    itself, it is possible to use the theory of singular control to                 address the questions posed above."

In many applications in reliability               theory, the main interest lies not necessarily in the total                     lifetime of the components of the system, but in the total                      benefit delivered by the system during its lifetime.  This is                   particularly important when a limited resource is available for                 enhancement of the components which make up the system.  Using                  the notions of majorization, stochastic convexity and stochastic                concavity, the optimal allocation policies will be sought.

This proposal concerns three topics  related to the infinitely-many-alleles model with selection.  The  first topic involves the simplest FV process with selection, and  the aim is to obtain an explicit formula for the transition  function (albeit less explicit than in the neutral case).  The  second topic concerns a model introduced by Tachida (referred to  by him as a nearly neutral mutation model), which can be  formulated as an FV process with an unbounded selection intensity  function.  The aim is establish uniqueness and study the ergodic  properties of the model, with the hope of explaining some of  Tachida's simulation findings.  The third topic involves the  concept of allelic genealogy introduced by Takahata and Nei.  One  can formulate an FV process that keeps track of such genealogies  in the infinitely-many-alleles setting.  There are several open  problems in the neutral case, but the challenge is to analyze the  selective models in a more rigorous way.  This proposal is concerned with certain stochastic (i.e., random)  processes in population genetics.  Each individual in a  population is assumed to be of some genetic ""type.""  The  processes model the evolution of the frequencies of the various  types in the population, taking into account such genetic factors  as random mating, mutation, and natural selection.  Letting the  set of possible types be arbitrary (in particular, infinite)  allows one to model the ``infinitely many alleles'' assumption.   It also allows one to incorporate historical or genealogical  information into the description of an individual's type.  Three  problems, concerning three specific models (each from the  biological literature), are proposed.  The problems are concerned  with providing a better mathematical understanding of the models  and possibly explaining certain phenomena discovered empirically   by biologists.  Each model involves selection, which complicates  it considerably, but makes it of greater interest than simply the  neutral case would be.  The difficulty with selection is that one  cannot obtain closed systems of linear equations for the  quantities of interest.  Nevertheless, several ideas are proposed  that should help to overcome this."

A large repertoire                 of shapes is assumed known in advance, and the problem is to then               devise computationally efficient algorithms for recognizing                     which, if any, of these objects are present in a given scene.

Examples include handwritten numerals                  and various biological shapes, such as leaves, hands, organelles,               etc. Here the issue of shape modeling appears to be central.  An                approach through  deformable templates is proposed.

In many applications in reliability               theory, the main interest lies not necessarily in the total                     lifetime of the components of the system, but in the total                      benefit delivered by the system during its lifetime.  This is                   particularly important when a limited resource is available for                 enhancement of the components which make up the system.

Single channels               patch clamp recordings provide important information about these                channels.  The apparently random character of the recorded                      currents has led to the widespread use of stochastic models.

At a microscopic level, charge is conducted                   through channels in the cell membrane called ion channels.

The resulting recordings reveal                  that the channels open and close in a random fashion and                        consequently methods of probability and statistics have played an               important role in the analysis of the recordings.

This makes it                    possible to derive partial differential equations that more                     accurately model the biological systems and also to prove results               about the particle systems with fast mixing.                                         Interacting particle systems have a structure that makes                   them appropriate for use in a variety of contexts in physics,                   chemistry, and biology.  There is a grid of sites, each of which                can have a fixed set of values.  For example, a city of                         individuals can be susceptible to, infected with, or immune to                  measles.  Each site changes its value at a rate that depends on                 the values of its neighbors, and this research is interested in                 determining what happens to the system over time.  These models                 should eventually provide a better understanding of global                      ecological problems."

One method of gaining an understanding of these  problems is to study them as stochastic models.  It is then  possible to estimate the average behavior of the optimal solution  and develop procedures that will produce solutions that, on  average, are close to the optimal.  The past research of the  investigator has demonstrated the relevance and the power of  various methods of this approach.  The main objective of this  research is to make further methodological progress in the  understanding of these stochastic models.  In an overwhelming number of practical situations, one is faced  with the problem of choosing, among a usually astronomical number  of possible configurations, the one with the lowest cost  (=optimal).  Even in very simple cases, this is intractable.  Since these problems must nonetheless be dealt with, getting a  deeper understanding of them is a goal of considerable  importance. One way to gain insight is to study these problems  under random input. Past research has demonstrated the relevance  to that study of sophisticated tools from various branches of  mathematics. The main objective of the present proposal is to  make further methodological progress through the study of a  number of concrete questions that crystalize the limits of  today's techniques."

Other part of this research   will  study two estimators of the variance of the sample mean  based on dependent data. These estimators are suggested by  blocking techniques and robust statistical procedures such as the  bootstrap and the jackknife. The estimators can be used as  selfnormalizers in the Central Limit Theorem.  One of the main problems of statistics is to provide interval  estimates for some unknown parameters. These confidence intervals  are constructed based on an estimator of the parameter and an  error given by the variability of this estimator.

The first pertains to the hydrodynamic description of self-organizing systems. Self-organizing automata or particle systems are open driven stochastic systems which evolve to a stationary distribution characterized by the nontrivial scaling behavior (as a function of system size) known as self-organized criticality. We have previously established that many of these systems near equilibrium can be described in certain limits by nonlinear diffusion equations, with a diffusion coefficient which has a singularity at a critical value of the local density. Scaling arguments suggest that the validity of this hydrodynamic description for the open (nonequilibrium) self-organizing automata depends on the size of the fluctuations in the local density in comparison to the rate at which the system converges to the critical density as the system size diverges. The purpose of this research is to rigorously investigate the validity of the singular diffusion description for the open systems, with the goal being general conditions for when fluctuations destroy the diffusion description. In the past several years there has been a considerable amount of activity in a number of scientific communities regarding self-organized criticality. Recent activity has focused on relatively simple systems, which, when simulated on the computer show broad distributions which change in a nontrivial way with the size of the system. The purpose of this research is to look at mathematical models which describe these systems."
