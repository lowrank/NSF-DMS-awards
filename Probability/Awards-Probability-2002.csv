Stochastic ordinary differential equations (sodes) on finite-dimensional manifolds generate stochastic flows on the manifold. One objective of the research is to construct invariant manifolds for such flows near stationary solutions, under suitable regularity and growth conditions on the driving vector fields. In particular, the investigator will prove the existence of stable, unstable and center manifolds near each stationary point on the manifold. In order for sodes to constitute viable physical models, the investigator conjectures that a Kupka-Smale type theorem must hold. An important class of infinite-dimensional semiflows on Hilbert space is generated by dissipative semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (spdes) on smooth compact manifolds. For these semiflows, the investigator intends to prove the existence of finite-dimensional invariant manifolds near stationary points. Important examples of spdes covered by this analysis are Burger's equation, affine linear stochastic evolution equations and stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. The results of the research will reveal new features of the stochastic dynamics of these well-studied models. One encounters models of stochastic systems with memory (sfdes) in many engineering and physical applications. Deterministic smooth constraints on the solutions of such models lead naturally to sfdes on (compact) Riemannian manifolds. The investigator will study the path-space-valued Markov process generated by trajectories of sfdes on the manifold. The investigator will establish an Ito formula for the infinite-dimensional segment process and will attempt to obtain its infinitesimal generator in terms of geometric invariants of the ambient Riemannian manifold. From the pathwise dynamical point of view, the investigator will construct perfect semiflows on the path space which are induced by solutions of sfdes on a compact Riemannian manifold. The existence of invariant manifolds will also be examined.<br/><br/>The project focuses on qualitative and long-term behavior of a large class of probabilistic models known as stochastic differential equations. These equations are widely used by scientists and engineers. Of special interest is a class of models that are used in physics, engineering and biology in order to analyze dynamical systems whose evolution is influenced by random fluctuations and past history. These models are very important in a variety of diverse areas such as signal processing, stock market fluctuations, economic and labor models, aircraft dynamics, materials with memory, population dynamics and fluid flow. The investigator will use the most current probabilistic techniques in order to develop a deeper understanding of these models. The outcome of the research in this project will yield precise information on the long-term behavior of solutions of the underlying stochastic equations on states that are near statistical equilibria. Numerical algorithms will be developed whereby real market data will be used to test option-pricing models where the stock price is governed by its past history. In a different direction, the research will solidify important connections with other areas of modern mathematical research, in particular the theory of dynamical systems and geometry. The results of the project will be compiled in a research monograph targeting graduate students majoring in mathematics, engineering, and finance. <br/>"

The following issues are to be addressed. 1. The existence of differential type inequalities related to hypoelliptic heat equations in finite dimensions, including the existence of logarithmic Sobolev and Poincare (or mass gap) type inequalities. 2. The existence of differential inequalities related to heat kernel measure and Wiener measures on path and loop spaces of Riemannian manifolds 3. The relationship between heat kernel measures and pinned Wiener measures on Loop spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds. 4. Extensions of Fock space like representations from finite dimensional groups to infinite dimensional loop groups. 5. The generalization of certain finite dimensional approximations to Wiener measures to include the ""super symmetric quantum mechanics"" setting used by physicists. <br/> Most of the questions to be studied in this research are motivated by, or are outgrowths of, questions coming from studying a number of fields, namely the spread of heat in curved metal plates, quantum mechanics, quantum field theories, and certain aspects of probability theory. These seemingly disparate fields turn out to share a common mathematical description, namely ""parabolic partial differential equations"" or equivalently the probabilistic theory of ""Brownian motion."" In most interesting (physically relevant) cases it is seldom possible to find explicit solutions to the complicated partial differential equations to be studied by the P.I. Nevertheless, it is often possible to discover interesting and relevant properties of the solutions. A typical phenomenon of parabolic partial differential equations is the fact that their solutions tend towards steady state values after waiting a sufficiently long time. For example, if a metal plate is heated in a non-uniform way and then left alone, the heat in the plate will redistribute itself over time so that the temperature reaches a constant equilibrium value throughout the plate. A fundamental problem, related to ""Poincare"" and ""logarithmic Sobolev"" inequalities, is the questions of how quickly do the systems described by the parabolic partial differential equations to be studied in this research converge to their equilibrium value. This same rate of convergence question has another interpretation in the context of quantum field theories describing relativistic (i.e. moving near the speed of light) elementary particles. For these theories the existence of a Poincare inequality has the desirable interpretation that the mathematical theory does not predict an unreasonable plethora of elementary particles. The particle interpretation of parabolic and related quantum mechanical Shrodinger equations will be another point of study. The particle interpretation goes under the title of Fock space representations which were mentioned in the first paragraph. <br/>"

Two major themes in the first topic are the stability of queueing networks and their heavy traffic limits. A queueing network is said to be stable when the associated Markov process is positive recurrent. The heavy traffic limit of a sequence of queueing networks is the diffusive limit obtained by applying the usual central limit scaling. Results over the last decade have led to a better understanding of queueing networks, although a general theory is lacking. The researcher plans to investigate the behavior of queueing networks under certain well-known disciplines, such as processor sharing and earliest-due-date, first-served. Other related topics in queueing theory include dynamic scheduling in heavy traffic and the stability of self-managed models for the internet. Interacting particle systems consist of systems of many particles that evolve according to some interaction law. Such systems are frequently motivated by models from the physical and biological sciences. The researcher plans to investigate models that have creation and annihilation of mass, as well the stationary measures of certain exclusion processes. <br/><br/>Professor Bramson's current research is in two areas of probability theory, queueing networks and interacting particle systems. In the first area, one studies the behavior of large systems of individuals who proceed from one server to the next, until their needs are satisfied and they leave the system. ""Individuals"" here should be interpreted in a general sense, and may be customers waiting to be served (for instance, at a bank or at a service counter), jobs in some manufacturing process (such as the production of semiconductor wafers) or information packets on the internet. In practice, one is often faced with the choice of whom to serve first. This choice can substantially affect the efficiency of a system, and sometimes even its stability. That is, based on how good a service rule is in a given setting, the number of customers waiting in line may typically remain small over extended periods of time, or may tend to grow without bound. Work over the last decade has shown that such systems can be unstable for unexpected reasons. The researcher plans to continue his work in this area and investigate the stability of the network under certain well-known service rules. The area of interacting particle systems is motivated by models from the physical and biological sciences consisting of large numbers of ""individuals"" who interact according to some rule. For instance, individuals might be molecules moving about according to some rule or cancer cells spreading along a surface. The behavior of these systems can depend strongly on the nature of their interactions. The researcher plans to continue his research on certain of these models. <br/>"

The Principle Investigator and his students are interested in estimating the real value of u. They discovered that they can define a Maximum Likelihood Estimator U of the unknown u even if u appeared in the diffusion coefficient. They are going to find the rate of convergence of U to the true parameter u under reasonable assumptions when the observation time is relatively long enough. Since in the real applications, x(t) can be only recorded at discrete time spots, they are particularly interested in the problems of error estimates related to discretizations of their models. <br/> The Principle Investigator and his students' research has its interests in the real applications. There are many examples of parameter estimates of diffusion processes in the applications. For example, it may be related to the trace of a military missile, or the price of a stock. All those models contain some unknown parameters. Moreover, any observation of the real path contains errors. Assuming that the observation error can be only bounded by a constant c, then no matter how one increases the computation steps in the time discretization method, the error of the estimate can not be significantly reduced beyond some number. In other words, the Principle Investigator and his students will find out the minimum steps needed for a computer to get enough accurate result when an observation error is recognized. This study has its potential military and financial applications. <br/>"

The powerful stochastic calculus for semimartingales are not applicable to them. Motivated by the urgent need from applications the principal investigator and his collaborators have developed a new stochastic calculus of Ito type based on the Wick product. He proposes to continue this research topic and to study the stochastic differential systems driven by fractional Brownian motions. First he shall study the existence, uniqueness and approximation of global solutions to stochastic differential systems driven by fractional Brownian motions. Many researchers have attempted to obtain result on these aspects with little success. The principal investigator has discovered a relationship between stochastic differential systems driven by fractional Brownian motions and quasilinear hyperbolic equations (of infinitely many variables). It is well-known that the latter equations are also difficult to solve. However, there are a number of results which are useful. This connection will lead to a better understanding of stochastic differential systems and the PI plans to explore this relation. Secondly, in application of the stochastic systems driven by fractional Brownian motions, one also needs to identify the coefficients and the Hurst parameter. The PI proposes to study one such identification problem and apply it to the investigation of the stochastic volatility model in financial market. <br/> To obtain the maximum benefit from a physical or social system, one needs to understand the system in the most precise way possible. This requires building a mathematical model for the dynamic evolution of the system. When the system is under the influence of some uncertain factors, the system should be modeled by a random process. Up to now one of the random processes which has received the most attention and has been studied the most is stochastic differential equations based on the so-called Brownian motion. Brownian motion has some nice properties such as Markovian: Its future state depends only on the present state and does not depend on the past. This simplicity makes the mathematics for it easy and very profound results have been achieved. In fact there have been enormous work on it over the past century. However, this elegant property also limits the applicability of such a random process, since it cannot be used to describe those systems whose future depend not only the present but also on past history! Fractional Brownian motions are random processes having this long range dependence and may be used to describe such systems. This proposal aims to construct mathematical tools for the fractional Brownian motions which have already found applications in hydrology, climatology, network traffic analysis, and finance. This research will have impact on these areas as well as in life science. <br/>"

Rigorous unconditional results about the geometric features of lattice-based FPP models are hard to come by, largely due to technical difficulties associated with the anisotropy of the underlying lattice. Models of Euclidean FPP take place on graphs constructed from a homogeneous Poisson process and enjoy complete statistical invariance under all rigid motions. In this sense, Euclidean FPP is a natural setting in which to study geometric properties of FPP. One objective of this proposal is to refine, for Euclidean FPP, existing estimates of key fluctuation exponents associated with these models with the ultimate goal of proving interesting qualitative results. Another goal is to exploit a certain re-scaling relation that holds for Euclidean FPP to obtain results about the stochastic monotonicity of passage time viewed as a function of distance. Other closely related open questions under investigation concern issues such as how massively a local perturbation of the Poisson particle configuration affects minimizing paths and how far ""parallel"" geodesics typically travel before coalescence. In Stochastic Ising models, rules of dynamics interact with a random initial state to produce a system that evolves with time. The state at any particular time is a configuration of +/-1 spins associated with the sites of some regular lattice; the configuration at time 0 makes the spins i.i.d. random variables. For the homogeneous ferromagnetic models of this proposal, the dynamics tend to produce increasing agreement of spins for neighboring sites as time elapses. Key matters of investigation concern how quickly and in what sense the system evolves to a limiting state as well as various percolation properties of the configuration as a function of time. <br/> Disordered systems are a large class of probabilistic models generally motivated by problems arising in condensed matter physics and materials science. First-passage percolation and other closely related models have served as a mathematical model for phenomena as seemingly diverse as properties of randomly porous media (such as aquifers), the growth of cancerous tumors, and the propagation of cracks through brittle material. Ising models capture the basic features of magnetized materials. The proposed work aims at a rigorous understanding of some of the many fundamental mathematical properties of these models.<br/>"

This representation, which was recently discovered by LeJan and Sznitman in France, is clearly intrinsic to the structure of the Navier-Stokes equations. While this is not the first attempt to use stochastic methods in connection with the flows associated with the Navier-Stokes equations, it does represent an entirely new direction which has the potential to transcend much of existing theory. Specific problems considered in this proposal seek to provide a better understanding of the role of spatial dimensions, boundary conditions, multi-scaling exponents and singularities, viscosity, homogeneity, isotropy and rotational accelerations, stationary flows and long-time evolution.<br/> The Navier-Stokes equations describe the basic physics governing the motion of fluid in its various forms of air, water, oil, etc. As such these equations play a fundamental role in science and engineering through the modeling of all varieties of fluid flow, from atmospheric and oceanic circulation to the flow of water beneath the earth's surface. Improved understanding of these equations and their solutions is essential to applications which range from tracking climate change and dispersion of contaminants in the Earth's environment, to more stable aerospace and sea vessel designs. The nonlinearity inherent in these equations makes explicit solutions possible only for the simplest of flows. Consequently the development of a more complete understanding of these equations at all physical length scales ranks among the most important outstanding problems of contemporary mathematical physics<br/>"

The goals are to exhibit a strong interdependence between local and long-term phenomena and to develop an implementable particle representation. The PI considers stochastic perturbations of the heat equation, with additive or multiplicative noise that depends on time and space. The dependence in time is of white-noise type, while the dependence in space can span a wide range of behaviors. The differential operator is the standard Laplacian on the real line or on the circle (or sometimes in higher dimensions), with a small diffusion parameter ""kappa"" included. In the multiplicative noise case, a nonlinearity may be included. The basic point of view is simple: an SPDE with a unique solution is an input-output system, and as such the solution's behavior must be inherited from the equation's coefficients. The local behavior to be considered is the modulus of continuity of the solution in the space variable. The long term behavior of interest, specific to the linear multiplicative case, is the large-time exponential asymptotics of the solution (Lyapunov ""exponent"" question). The PI characterizes both of these behaviors via the spatial modulus of continuity of the potential itself, extends some of the results to equations driven by fBm, and designs a new numerical method for the solution using a system of interacting particles. It is shown that the solution's Lyapunov exponent is of the order of kappa to the power of alpha/(1+alpha) where alpha is the almost-sure spatial Holder exponent of the solution. It is also shown that the solution has spatial Holder exponent alpha if and only if the same holds for the potential's antiderivative. An investigation of how these results change when one uses fractional noise instead of white noise is also considered. For the nonlinear equation, a branching and interacting particle system is constructed as the basis for a numerical method for simulating the solution. It is proved that the numerical scheme, when properly mollified, converges to the solution in the Skorohod space of continuous-function-valued ""cadlag"" processes. The particles interact because, as they branch at evenly spaced short intervals, their mean number of offspring is a random variable whose mean is calculated relative to a certain ""fitness"" of all the other particles, and depends explicitly on the non-linearity of the potential. <br/> The main physical meaning of the research is that a complex space-time-dependent system with significant random perturbations can exhibit an exponentially strong increase of size or energy in the long term, and that the exponential rate of increase can be predicted precisely by looking at the short-range spatial variability of the physical environment. This has potentially important applications in hydrodynamics and turbulence, including a local characterization of the so-called ""fast dynamo effect."" It would say that a magnetic field in a magnetic fluid can be enhanced precisely by controlling the fluid's mezoscopic level of turbulence. The research has important educational effects. Ph.D. students and, under the PI's supervision, undergraduates and MS students, conduct computer simulations in connection with the particle methods, with an emphasis on designing efficient algorithms. The simulations are being integrated as class projects in a new curriculum emphasis in computational finance and other applications, preparing the students for the technology-dominated job market and workplace. From the purely theoretical point of view, the research brings together several areas of great current interest in probability theory: infinite dimensional stochastic analysis, branching and interacting particle systems and numerical methods, Gaussian regularity theory, Lyapunov exponents. <br/>"

For example, in the random cluster model, there are 4 natural critical values of p for each value of q.  The PI is continuing his previous investigations of the relations among these values on planar Cayley graphs of groups.  Two other models under investigation concern random spanning forests in graphs.  One of these is obtained from limits of minimal spanning trees in finite graphs, while the other is from uniform spanning trees.  The former is connected to percolation, a special case of the random cluster model.  The latter, connected to random walks and potential theory, is much better understood.  The PI is working to bring the state of knowledge of the minimal spanning forest closer to that for the uniform spanning forest.  There are also many open questions related to the uniform spanning forest that the PI is investigating.  When one views uniform spanning forests as determinantal probability measures, there are a large number of new questions that open up.  For example, the PI is working to establish basic topological properties of higher-dimensional analogues of random forests and to establish conjectures that arise by analogy to percolation. Phase transitions and entropy of other determinantal dynamical systems are also under investigation.<br/><br/>The field of statistical physics is concerned to a great extent with mathematical models of phase transitions (e.g., water to ice).  Typically the model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions.  This lattice is infinite and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group.  The simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in the ground and gas flow through a gas mask.  One asks how far fluid can flow, in particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far.  This, of course, depends on the density of particles; there is a phase transition as the density increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can no longer flow arbitrarily far.  One would like to know where that point is and how the probability changes as this critical point is approached.  About a decade ago, several researchers began investigating lattices that are quite different from the usual Euclidean ones that are most familiar and that most closely correspond to our physical world.  These new lattices, called nonamenable, are also usually based on groups. Such investigations began out of the usual scientific and mathematical curiosity that drives fundamental research.  Within the last 5 years, this area of research, statistical physics on nonamenable groups, has seen an explosion of interest.  This area of research turns out to be quite rich and to contain a large number of important fundamental questions whose answers remain unknown.  Already, there have been applications to Euclidean lattices of some of the new ideas that have arisen in response to the need to develop new tools for nonamenable groups.<br/>"

Probability densities for this stochastic process solve the classical diffusion equation. A continuous time random walk is a simple random walk subordinated to a renewal process, used in physics to model anomalous diffusion. Increments of the simple random walk represents particle jumps, and the renewal epochs represent the particle jump times. Infinite variance particle jumps cause superdiffusion, in which a cloud of particles spreads faster than the classical model predicts. Infinite mean waiting times lead to subdiffusion. Scaling limits of continuous time random walks are stochastic processes whose densities solve fractional partial differential equations. Infinite variance particle jumps lead to operator stable Levy motions, while infinite mean waiting times induce subordination to an inverse stable subordinator. Fractional derivatives are generators of stable continuous convolution semigroups. The research funded by this grant is developing a sound mathematical basis for this physical theory, and pursuing practical applications to problems in contaminant transport. The goals of this research include limit theory for continuous time random walks with possible dependence between the jump sizes and the waiting times, extension to more realistic multidimensional jump vectors with matrix scaling to allow different rates of particle spreading in each coordinate, parallel development of multiscaling fractional derivative operators in space, analysis of the fundamental physical basis of fractional diffusion to elucidate the physical meaning of the model parameters, development of useful statistical methods for parameter estimation, numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations, and application of these methods to real data from laboratory and field experiments and remediation efforts involving porous media and fracture flow. <br/> Movement of contaminants in a mountain stream takes place over a vast range of time scales. A majority will move away quickly, but a small amount can be caught in eddies for minutes or days. Another fraction may move into the relatively motionless water beneath the streambed, and it may take months or years for the last molecules to disappear completely. The movement of contaminants in underground water spreads over a similar range of time scales. Our team of mathematicians and hydrogeologists uses modern interdisciplinary research methods to develop accurate models for the movement and spread of these contaminants. Much more than an academic exercise, this work is needed for realistic models of contaminant and nutrient movement in drinking water supplies. The research is necessary because existing diffusion models greatly underestimate the time and concentration at which contaminants arrive downstream, when compared to actual data."

The problems selected are motivated primarily by applications in mathematical finance, but the results will be of more general theoretical significance. In stochastic calculus, new results about stopping times will lead to better models of credit risk and a deeper understanding of what makes possible successful hedging of financial risks. New progress in stochastic calculus will help extend theories of incomplete markets, i.e. markets containing risks that can not be perfectly hedged, as is true in practice. One Monte Carlo issue to be addressed is the optimal use of an algorithm that has recently become popular in option pricing. Another line of research will involve improving numerical techniques for solutions of stochastic differential equations in connection with simulation. A third Monte Carlo topic is the optimal application of some variance reduction techniques that are well suited to problems in nuclear physics, estimation of rare events probabilities, and some option pricing problems. The recent development of a new model for stock prices that incorporates sizes of trade will lead to new pricing technology for financial derivatives. <br/> The application of probability to finance has revolutionized an industry. In the past 20 years the creation of multi-trillion dollar derivative security markets has facilitated the world-wide flow of capital and thereby enhanced international commerce and productivity. Without the mathematical models which provide reliable pricing of derivative securities (e.g., stock options) and guide the management of their associated risk, these markets could not exist. The underlying theme of the mathematical success has been to compute precisely the price of financial derivatives which enable companies to lay off risk by buying financial instruments that protect them from unlikely but possibly disastrous events. Equally if not more important has been the description of a recipe for the seller of the instrument to follow in order to protect himself from the risk he accepts through the sale. A complete market is one in which the theory explains how to do this in principle, and in such a market the theory often provides an explicit guide to implementation of this recipe. In other words, in complete markets a new type of insurance has been created, and this has been made possible by existing probability theory. This type of ""risk insurance"" generated the revolution mentioned above. A real problem, however, is that in reality markets are not complete, and thus new mathematical techniques are needed to extend the theory and to make it more truly applicable. This has already begun, but it is in its infancy, and this extension of the theory will be a large focus of the proposed project. In addition, recently new models have been proposed to better incorporate liquidity issues and market frictions (such as transaction costs when implementing stock trades), in part by the PI himself. These models will continue to be developed, calibrated, and statistically verified. <br/>"

Over the next few years the investigator plans to concentrate his efforts on large sample theory problems connected with particular functionals of the empirical distribution. These include the L1-norm density estimator process, integral functionals of density estimators and local empirical and U-statistics processes.<br/> The anticipated results should have potential use in the development of a class of practical goodness-of-fit techniques and statistical estimators. In fact, these investigations have already given rise to a number of new methods to assess and describe in an intelligent way the behavior of the underlying mechanism that generates natural phenomena.<br/>"

The major objectives are to extend the understanding of related topics and build a general theory based on systematic study of various techniques and applications. The recent completion of the connection between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems allows applications of tools and results from functional analysis to provide the most powerful method available at this time for estimating the lower bound for Gaussian processes. In turn, it suggests many further questions connected to applications in probability theory and geometric functional analysis. Similar relationships will be studied for other random processes such as stable processes and Gaussian chaos. The overview on rare events depending on small values unifies many problems from diverse areas in mathematics. The very successful applications of Gaussian methods to lower tail probabilities, the Brownian pursuit models and the first exit times will be expanded to a detailed study of zeros of random polynomials, balancing vectors, and Hadamard matrices. <br/> The primary focus of this research is a better understanding of rare random phenomena related to Gaussian processes and others which serve as models in many applications. These types of problems often arise in estimating the chances for rare events to occur in areas where such events are of fundamental importance, such as weather, economic indices, epidemics, etc. This research should improve our understanding of rare random events and provide basic tools for the study of our random environment. <br/>"

In particular, the PI proposes to develop sharp inequalities for the moments of self-normalized processes, as well as for sums of multilinear forms and U-statistics (unbiased statistics) in independent and dependent variables. In addition, the PI intends to further develop a novel approach to approximating the expected time it takes a process (with a general dependence structure) to hit a given boundary. The interest in the study of self-normalized processes stems from their use as key quantities in the development of non-parametric estimators, as well as for their use as pivotal quantities for the creation of confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis. For example, the t-statistic is a self-normalized and unit-less estimator commonly used in the testing of hypotheses about the mean of a distribution with unknown variance. The interest on sharp results for self-normalized estimators is based in part in the need for approximating p-values and the power of tests in situations when the assumptions on the variables need to be relaxed (e.g. independence, normality and/or identical distribution). The study of results related to sums of multilinear forms and U-statistics is related to their use as building blocks in the development of certain stochastic integrals, as well as for their use as the typical unbiased estimators in statistics. Moreover, sums of multilinear forms in independent random variables are frequently used in approximating non-linear estimators of moving averages, which are of fundamental importance in econometric studies. <br/> The proposed work concerning the development of new and improved tools (under relaxed assumptions) for the study of statistical estimators is important for the assessment of hypotheses with direct implications in medical and social sciences as well as engineering through its connection to the comparison of competing treatments and technologies under a wider set of scenarios than is currently possible. The study on how long it takes for a random process to hit a boundary, on the basis of historical evidence, has potential important implications in the physical sciences and economics including in the study of how long it will take for 1) a tornado to hit a city, 2) a person to develop cancer, 3) an earthquake to occur or 4) the stock market to crash<br/>"

A new ""functional"" form of nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula is sought, via a study of the general theory of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with non-Lipschitz coefficients. The path regularity of the solutions to reflected backward SDEs (RBSDEs) will be studied, with an eye on its application to the numerical method for such equations. The study will also lead to the regularity of solutions to a class of obstacle problems in PDEs, via some new probabilistic representation formulae for the derivatives of such solutions. The PI proposes to continue his research on the new notion of stochastic viscosity solution for nonlinear SPDEs, including the stability and uniqueness results in the fully nonlinear case. Some stochastic control/stochastic finance problems, inspired by a risk reserve model involving investment, will receive strong attention. One example is the optimal retention/investment problem for an insurance company that uses the ruin probability as its stability criterion. <br/> The Feynman-Kac Formula is a powerful tool that links probability theory to analysis, especially to the theory of partial differential equations. The nonlinear form of this formula is useful for studying many nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations such as reaction diffusion equations, derived from expansion of advantaged genes in biology, combustion theory, as well as chemical kinetics. The celebrated Black-Scholes formula in modern stochastic finance theory and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in stochastic control theory are also, in essence, examples of the formula. The main part of the proposed research is to discover the possibility of advancing such formulae to a higher level, either by considering the ""functional form"", or by considering the ""stochastic form"" (viscosity solution of fully nonlinear SPDEs). Some stochastic control problems arising from finance, insurance, and many other fields are naturally considered as applications of the theory. <br/>"

There are many analogies between problems considered in this project and representation theory in quantum physics, in particular, Mackey's theory. This project is intended to build on these analogies to establish spectral representation of isotropic stable random fields in possibly the most explicit form that could be used for analysis, modeling and computer simulation of such random fields. The second part of this proposal is concerned with infinite dimensional stochastic integrals. Various sample path properties of stochastic processes, such as continuity and boundedness, can often be described in terms of the existence of such infinite dimensional stochastic integrals. It is proposed to simplify and unify the present approach to infinite dimensional stochastic integrals of deterministic functions and then to extend these results to nonanticipating integrands using decoupling techniques, among others. This is an outgrowth of the present research of the PI with Professor Michael B. Marcus. Development of stochastic integrals with respect to cylindrical semimartingales in Hilbert spaces is also proposed. This development will follow a recent progress of the PI and his collaborators on the radonification of cylindrical semimartingales. <br/> Isotropic random fields play an important role in the statistical theory of turbulence and other areas of natural sciences and engineering. They can be used to model 3-dimensional turbulent velocity, velocity and pressure, etc. The classical theory of isotropic random fields is not suitable for modeling random phenomena with long range dependence and high variability, that are often observed. Therefore, the PI proposes to investigate isotropic random fields with heavy tailed stable distributions. Puzzling connections with certain methods of quantum physics are found under this approach; they will be further investigated and exploited. The second part of this proposal is concerned with the theory and applications of infinite dimensional stochastic integrals. The importance and need for the study of such integrals comes from the theory of random systems characterized by very large or continuous set of parameters. Infinite dimensional approach makes such systems simpler and mathematically tractable. <br/>"

In the area of stochastic spatial models, he will study the asymptotic behavior of multitype voter models where voters have several opinions and are more likely to imitate neighbors with similar opinions. With Ted Cox he will work to extend their conclusions for the stepping stone model to samples of size k > 2, and will study equilibrium properties of a hybrid zone which results when each of two alleles is favored in one half of the space. With Ed Perkins he will study measure valued limits of particle systems to produce limit processes with interactions between different types of particles. Not all of the systems Durrett studies will be spatial however: he will work with Jason Schweinsberg to develop approximations of genetic hitchhiking that involve the coalescent with multiple collisions, will study the phase transition in a quasi-species model which models properties of viruses with high mutation rates, and will continue his work with Vlada Limic on Kauffmann's NK model, which is a prototypical example of a fitness landscape with a large number of local maxima.<br/> Durrett's research is motivated by a variety of applications. Durrett will work with Ted Cox to extend their work on spatial genetics models to investigate explanations for the surprisingly large amount of linkage disequilibrium (genetic correlation) in the human genome. Understanding the possible sources of patterns in DNA sequences is important for using association mapping to locate genes and to identify footprints of positive selection. In relation to the latter question, Durrett will work with Jason Schweinsberg to develop an approximation to the genetic hitchhiking that occurs with the fixation of favorable mutation, which will allow for the derivation of analytical results for quantities that can currently be understood only by simulation.

Motivated originally by the interest of the proposer in solving the hot spots conjecture, the first problem concerns the construction of couplings of reflecting Brownian motion in convex domains. The author introduced a new type of coupling of reflecting Brownian motions, which led him to a partial resolution of the hot spots conjecture; the author will try to develop these coupling arguments, with the hope of solving this long-standing conjecture with roots in mathematical physics. In connection to this problem is the more general conjecture of the diagonal monotonicity of the Neumann heat kernel of convex domains with one axis of symmetry (which implies the hot spots conjecture). A related open problem which the PI intends to study is Chavel's conjecture on the domain monotonicity of Neumann heat kernel. In the view of the PI, coupling techniques can be used here to obtain classes of domains for which Chavel's conjecture holds true. Finally, in connection to all above-mentioned problems is the more general problem of finding a precise dependence of the Neumann heat kernels of two convex planar domains. <br/> Reflecting Brownian motion has been observed and studied for more than one century, since it was first observed by the English botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Its most recent spectacular application is probably the famous work of Black-Scholes, which changed forever the guessing game of the price of a stock option in a mathematical sense by tying it to the random behavior of a Brownian motion. This led to the award of a the Nobel prize for Economics in 1997. Other applications of reflecting Brownian motion are in potential theory, partial differential equations, mathematical physics and mathematical finance. The present research aims to develop and study certain properties of reflecting Brownian motion (monotonicity properties and domain dependence of the transition density), which will give a deeper understanding of this fundamental stochastic process. In turn, this gives as applications properties of functions arising from real-life situations, whenever a connection to this process can be established (for example the extremum properties of the temperature of a thermally insulated body). <br/>"

Probability densities for this stochastic process solve the classical diffusion equation. A continuous time random walk is a simple random walk subordinated to a renewal process, used in physics to model anomalous diffusion. Increments of the simple random walk represents particle jumps, and the renewal epochs represent the particle jump times. Infinite variance particle jumps cause superdiffusion, in which a cloud of particles spreads faster than the classical model predicts. Infinite mean waiting times lead to subdiffusion. Scaling limits of continuous time random walks are stochastic processes whose densities solve fractional partial differential equations. Infinite variance particle jumps lead to operator stable Levy motions, while infinite mean waiting times induce subordination to an inverse stable subordinator. Fractional derivatives are generators of stable continuous convolution semigroups. The research funded by this grant is developing a sound mathematical basis for this physical theory, and pursuing practical applications to problems in contaminant transport. The goals of this research include limit theory for continuous time random walks with possible dependence between the jump sizes and the waiting times, extension to more realistic multidimensional jump vectors with matrix scaling to allow different rates of particle spreading in each coordinate, parallel development of multiscaling fractional derivative operators in space, analysis of the fundamental physical basis of fractional diffusion to elucidate the physical meaning of the model parameters, development of useful statistical methods for parameter estimation, numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations, and application of these methods to real data from laboratory and field experiments and remediation efforts involving porous media and fracture flow. <br/> Movement of contaminants in a mountain stream takes place over a vast range of time scales. A majority will move away quickly, but a small amount can be caught in eddies for minutes or days. Another fraction may move into the relatively motionless water beneath the streambed, and it may take months or years for the last molecules to disappear completely. The movement of contaminants in underground water spreads over a similar range of time scales. Our team of mathematicians and hydrogeologists uses modern interdisciplinary research methods to develop accurate models for the movement and spread of these contaminants. Much more than an academic exercise, this work is needed for realistic models of contaminant and nutrient movement in drinking water supplies. The research is necessary because existing diffusion models greatly underestimate the time and concentration at which contaminants arrive downstream, when compared to actual data."

A natural sub-optimal strategy can be exhibited. It is further shown how one can create a long-term portfolio strategy which asymptotically withdraws money at the (same) asymptotic rate at which the portfolio is growing, without diminishing that long-term rate(!). 3) Extend previous work on self-normalized martingales. 4) Attempt to construct and/or identify extremal distributions which arise in various situations maximizing the expected value of some random quantity subject to infinitely many linear inequality constraints. 5) Develop an idea, conveyed to him in 1992 by Prof. David L. Allen, to show how to construct a natural posterior distribution on densities in R, given only the data acquired, and extending the result to R^d by means of the Radon Transform. This approach permits one to establish confidence intervals for parameter estimation, to perform hypothesis testing and data classification with only finite samples. Goodness of fit tests are also contemplated. <br/> The principle investigator plans work in five areas: quantile approximation for sums of arbitrary independent random variables, optimal investment strategy designed to guard against local capital losses of more than a pre-set proportion of the previous maximal accumulated wealth (plus a method of permitting consumption at the long run growth rate without sacrificing that long-run rate), extend previous work on self-normalized martingales, solve or find approximately optimal solutions to certain infinite dimensional linear programming problems, demonstrate how to make full use of the data acquired in statistical settings which involve hypothesis testing or classification (categorization) of data. The investment work should be of fundamental interest and importance to individual, corporate and community (governmental) investment. The data analysis efforts may suggest a best possible approach to determining whether a particular datum came from A or B given limited prior data on A and B. Such work could be useful in character recognition, hand-writing decipherment, etc. The other topics were motivated by prior work of the PI. <br/>"

The research will continue in several new directions. The growth models featured in this project range from simple threshold rules and competition dynamics, to interacting systems of random walks and percolation models in low- and high-dimensional spaces. Among the principle topics are: effects of random perturbations in the environment and in the rule, fluctuations of random interfaces, generation of fractal patterns, behavior of large--neighborhood systems, large scale limits of systems of random walks, and relationship between structure of genotype space and genetic diversity. <br/> The aim of this project is to understand microscopic and macroscopic principles by which various physical systems propagate disturbances far from the equilibrium. Among instances of such growth dynamics are crystal growth, spread of epidemics, propagation of waves, competition between species, and genetic diversification. Such research can contribute to understanding of such natural phenomena as: threshold density for survival and growth vs. the range of interaction for species in an unfriendly environment, transition between sharp geometric crystal shapes and rough random ones, effects of noisy environments on spread of infections, validity of approximation based on large range of interaction or fast diffusion, and role of neutral mutations in genetic drift. <br/>"

Building on previous research, we focus on the stochastic analysis of (i) random packing, random growing interfaces, and loose sphere packing, all in two or more dimensions, and (ii) functionals of Boolean models and random Euclidean point sets in computational geometry and combinatorial optimization. The aim in (i) is to establish thermodynamic limits, Gaussian fluctuations, and functional central limit theorems for functionals associated with packing models, interface models, as well as for random Euclidean point sets in general. All of these models exhibit finite range interactions and long-range dependence. Part (ii) focuses on the probabilistic analysis of functionals of random point sets in Euclidean space. The proposed work in (ii) will further our understanding of solutions to Euclidean optimization problems, random graphs in computational geometry, and the statistical analysis of random data. <br/> One of the central problems in physical, chemical, and biological processes involves understanding the growth of random interfaces. Such interfaces arise naturally in understanding chemical deposition, the morphology of vascular networks, growth patterns in fracture analysis, and the porosity of media. Dynamic random interfaces, ones which change with time, are useful in understanding and modeling crystal growth as well as understanding patterns in nature which change with time. This includes diverse phenomena such as the spread of disease in a population, the growth patterns in a forest fire, as well as the fracture analysis of metals such as those found in aircraft. Much of our understanding of random interfaces is only experimental. This proposal seeks to put our understanding of random interfaces on a solid theoretical foundation. Understanding the behavior of random interfaces currently forms a central part of the principal investigator's collaboration with scientists from the Lehigh University engineering school as well as with scientists from Lucent Technologies. <br/>"

Work to be performed will extend the range of applicability of these methods, develop new constructions of particle representations, and address problems of existence and uniqueness of solutions of the stochastic equations underlying these representations. Application of the results to filtering and to theoretical models in finance will provide both useful intuition and a check on the appropriateness of the theoretical developments. Spatial point processes characterized as stationary distributions of Markov birth and death processes and as solutions of stochastic equations driven by Poisson random measures will be studied. The work will focus on spatial ergodicity and central limit theorems with applications to parameter estimation in mind. <br/><br/>The study of stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions of natural phenomena governed by ""random"" or ""chance"" mechanisms. Mathematical models of such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or both.
