The project studies complex random systems motivated by real-world questions, including the structure of ice and other condensed matter, magnetism, quantum systems, polymers, thermodynamics, and traffic models. The PI aims to discover and analyze systems living in discrete space that capture the essential large-scale and long-time physical phenomena, yet are ""integrable"", that is, simple enough for exact mathematical treatment. The analysis of integrable random systems is powered by explicit formulas and various symmetries coming from algebraic structures. Of special interest are time-dependent irreversible systems and models with impurities displaying a wide range of conjecturally universal behavior. The project provides research opportunities for graduate students as well as training activities through organization of summer school on integrable probability. <br/><br/>The project revolves around new and known integrable stochastic systems whose structure is accessible through the Yang-Baxter equation or symmetric functions. The scope of the studied models includes interacting particle systems on the one-dimensional lattice with local or global interaction (asymmetric simple exclusion process and discrete analogs of the Dyson Brownian motion, respectively), random tilings, and other statistical mechanical systems. The goals are three-fold: (1) discover new models with integrable structure (such as q- and Macdonald analogs of Dyson Brownian motion); (2) find previously overlooked symmetries in well-known models (such as time-reversal symmetries in particle systems with arbitrary initial data); and (3) probe new asymptotic phenomena and establish their universality (such as inhomogeneous deformations of pure Gibbs states and the Gaussian Free Field). The goals will be achieved by finding and analyzing exact formulas for moments and correlations (with the help of symmetric functions and vertex models), and also by developing distributional symmetries using Markov maps, or by introducing many inhomogeneous parameters into the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Special emphasis is placed on vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields that play a central role in various areas of pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, astronomy, bio-imaging, mathematical oceanography, and statistics. The Principal Inestigator (PI) will develop probabilistic, analytic, and geometric tools for studying vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields that will lead to a deeper understanding of random fields that arise from systems of SPDEs and random matrices. These tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of open problems in the theory of SPDEs, random matrices, and related random fields. Moreover, the proposed activities will also help to train graduate students and to develop their careers in the mathematical and statistical sciences. <br/><br/>It is significant and challenging to characterize the fine analytic and geometric structures of vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields. In the past investigations, the PI has established a series of results on Gaussian and, more generally, infinitely divisible random fields, and the solutions of SPDEs. Together with his collaborators, the PI has developed fractal geometry and potential theory for Gaussian random fields, additive Lévy processes, solutions to SPDEs, and used them to resolve several outstanding open problems in non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields, Lévy processes, and the theory of SPDEs. The PI plans to continue his investigation of precise quantitative connections between vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields, SPDEs, potential theory, and the geometry of random fractals. The proposed research will ultimately yield novel insights into the understanding of vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields, SPDEs, and random matrices. The expected results will not only contribute to the theories of random fields, SPDEs, and random matrices but also promote their applicability in mathematics, mathematical physics, and in other scientific areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many classic games of skill, players move alternately. In random-turn games, however, the players bid to win the right to move and must budget resources in their efforts to win the game. Analyzing such stake-governed random-turn games is a matter of understanding how a precious resource should be budgeted in the long-term in order to maintain strategic advantage; seeking a solution to how to play the game involves capturing the balance needed between the short-term territorial gain of spending big and the long-term cost in diminished capability that arises from such profligacy. Stake-governed random-turn games lie at the intersection of probability and geometry and are one of several directions that the Principal Investigator (PI) will explore in this project. Indeed, techniques from probability and geometry will be also used to address several important physical problems, including how trapping by obstacles impedes a linearly progressing particle, or how random fractals formed as a result of growth in a disordered random environment are sensitive to perturbation of that environment by random disorder. By dissemination, mentorship and collaboration, the PI  will seek to ensure that the research enhances the mathematical experience and trajectory of junior researchers including graduate students via joint research to develop fundamental tools,  and high-school students via coding projects.<br/><br/>The PI will develop robust geometric and probabilistic tools in order to elucidate several problems in the rigorous theory of statistical mechanics and in game theory on graphs.  The mechanism of trapping of a biased motion in the supercritical infinite open cluster in the Euclidean lattice will be studied. This work will harness basic tools involving resampling and surgical techniques in the Ornstein-Zernike theory of subcritical lattice models that will be developed under this grant.  The fractal structure of scaled universal objects in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class of models of growth in random media will be studied; as will  the sensitivity to noise of scaled KPZ structures. For the latter purpose, tools in discrete harmonic analysis, such as the spectral sample, which have been applied to solve problems in dynamics on critical percolation, will be redeveloped for last passage percolation models. Novel formulas will be proved indicating how skilful players of random-turn games on graphs choose to spend budgets that dictate their local win probabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Probabilistic models are widespread in fields like biology, statistical physics, quantum mechanics, and machine learning. Examples include models of cancer growth, spread of disease in population, governing principles of subatomic particles, black holes, neural networks, etc. The purpose of this project is to understand the geometry and intrinsic properties of a string of models that are representatives of these examples. The project aims to resolve open questions in those fields based on tools that the investigator has developed. <br/><br/>Domino tilings, random matrices, and stochastic six vertex models are areas of intense interest in the field of statistical physics, while Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) and theory of optimal transport have gained immense attention in the fields of quantum mechanics and machine learning. This project revolves around questions in those areas and aims to acquire new insights about their geometry and integrability. In particular, this project plans to: (1) find laws of iterated logarithms and fractal dimension of models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class including the KPZ fixed point, edge spectrum of random matrices, and domino tilings; (2) build a unified framework for studying the moment formulas of interacting particle systems and vertex models including the stochastic six vertex model; (3) rigorously prove modular transformation properties of conformal blocks of LCFT and partition functions from gauge theory; and (4) study the convergence of entropically regularized optimal transport to optimal transport when the regularization vanishes. By intermingling ideas from various fields including geometry of polymers, representation theory, Riemann-Hilbert techniques, quantum groups, and convex geometry, the investigator aims to resolve questions that were hard to tackle with other methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interplay between mathematical models and probability is rich and profound with applications far-reaching across all fields of science. This interplay can appear in many physical settings in materials science and fluid dynamics, but also in the modeling of various many-agent or many-particle dynamics, such as the self-organized motion of organisms or the spread of an infectious disease through a population. The Centre de Recherches Mathématiques is organizing an intensive thematic program on this topic, ""Probabilities and PDEs"" during the period January 2022 -- July 2022. There will be four workshops, each with mini courses specifically aimed at graduate students or early-career researchers in related areas, and many long-term visiting scientists as well. This award provides funding to support the participation of US-based graduate students, early career researchers, and under-represented minorities through travel and accommodation during one of the two workshops and accompanying mini-courses. This will provide the participants with a perfect opportunity to interact with each other and with leaders of the field and will help them to understand the major questions and learn the cutting-edge methods of the field.<br/><br/>Probability and PDEs have always been intertwined and modern research continues to intertwine them further. One common aspect concerns how introducing randomness into PDEs, through e.g. random initial data, random environments, random forcing will profoundly affect the long-term behavior, either because it provides a flexible and realistic approach to study physical models or because it is an inevitable feature of models of the underlying systems. Another aspect is how one can obtain deterministic PDEs from underlying random many-agent or many-problems, such as in classical kinetic theory or in many-agent problems such as in mathematical epidemiology. The program will bring together world experts and junior researchers in an intensive and focused program that will help to greatly further the understanding of these phenomena and this award will help train the next generation of US-based scientists in these methods.

The appearance of such rare events may be understood by investigating specific mechanisms arising from the interaction between the components constituting the system. It turns out that a large class of functions in number theory are formidable models to extend the current theory of extreme value statistics. The aim of this project is to develop new probabilistic techniques to describe at various scales the fine statistics of extrema of number-theoretic functions. These techniques will then be applied to related problems in physics and mathematics. The project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate students and graduate students in computer programming, data science and mathematics.<br/><br/>More precisely, the Riemann zeta function (and to a larger extent the Dirichlet L-functions) is a fundamental function in number theory as it encodes the distribution of prime numbers among the integers. Large values of such functions in particular contain information about the location of the primes, yet they remain poorly understood. This research project builds on recent progress to describe the large values of the zeta function in short intervals. The current project aims at developing new probabilistic techniques to describe the precise statistics of the large values of the zeta function as the size of the observation interval is varied.  In particular, the research carried out in this project is expected to reveal new hybrid statistics at small scales. The project also seeks to extend the techniques to Dirichlet L-functions, where few results are currently available. The ultimate goal is to build better tools of extreme value theory. The interdisciplinary nature of the project is expected to produce new theoretical and numerical tools in probability as well as in analytic number theory. The theoretical results and numerical experiments in combination will clarify the elusive connection between random matrices and L-functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to develop new theory for such random graph processes, in order to better understand their properties, improve existing methods of analysis, and rigorously justify their applications. In doing so, the proposed research addresses long-standing open questions in phase transition of dependent random graph processes. The goal of this research is to show that a variety of dependent random graph processes exhibit similar phase transition behavior. Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering. The educational component includes annual K-12 math teacher workshops, research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students,and a multidisciplinary workshop/summer school for junior researchers and undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the development of new theory and applications for time-evolving random graph processes with dependencies (that grow step-by-step according to specific rules or structural constraints). One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project also features a number of educational components that integrate research and teaching.  These components include a summer academy for high school students interested in advanced mathematics; participation in organized activities designed to allow high school students and scientists to meet and interact in an informal setting using interactive demonstrations; and undergraduate and graduate student mentoring.  <br/><br/>The overarching research goal of this project is to understand the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random matrices with dependent entries.  The research program is divided into three themes, which are quite disparate in background, application, and tools.  The first theme concerns the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices arising in the study of random networks and graphs, including matrices that appear in synchronization problems and network control theory.  Motivated by open questions in statistical genetics, the second theme concerns the spectral properties of sample covariance matrices constructed from dependent random samples.

Both workshops are part of a larger interdisciplinary thematic program on ""Probabilities and PDEs"" held at CRM from January to July 2022. Probability theory and the theory of partial differential equations (PDEs) are important areas of mathematics with substantial overlap in their methods and goals. In both fields, one of the major aims is to provide accurate models of how engineered, physical, chemical and biological systems change over time. Probability frequently focuses on how systems which are random and/or unpredictable at the microscopic level can become highly ordered at the macroscopic level. PDE theory frequently focuses on the spatial and temporal evolution of such macroscopic systems. For decades there has been a fruitful interplay between the two fields probability and PDEs, with both intuitions and mathematical techniques from each area finding application in the other. <br/><br/>This project focuses on two aspects of that interplay, which are both related to how probabilistic particle systems resemble PDEs when sufficiently ""zoomed out"". One of these, the area of mean-field games, describes scaling limits of strategically controlled interacting agents evolving as diffusions coupled via a graph structure (often the complete graph). The second, interacting particle systems and hydrodynamic limits, typically focuses on PDE approximations for particle systems in more geometric settings, such as lattices (on taking an appropriate fine-mesh limit in both space and time).

The outcomes of the project will enhance the applicability of methods for high-dimensional data settings, and the research results will be applied in statistics and econometrics. The project will promote teaching, training, and learning activities at the University of Minnesota. The main educational goals are (a) to train PhD students at the University of Minnesota; and (b) to promote collaboration among experts and students.

They include Haar orthogonal/unitary matrices, sample correlation matrices, Macdonald measures and circular orthogonal ensembles. The investigator will then apply them to answer statistics and econometrics problems. The project consists of the following main themes: (1)  the investigator plans to study the approximation of Haar-invariant orthogonal/unitary matrices by independent normals. The solutions are known when the approximation errors are measured by some well-known distances, including the total variation distance.  Besides their relevance in theoretical research, they are also applied to data storage. The investigator plans to study the same approximation question under the Wasserstein distance; (2) the investigator plans to explore the Macdonald measure and show the eigenvalues are asymptotically a Gaussian Free Field. A function of these eigenvalues is shown to converge to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos. Nowadays active investigations such as  the construction of the Liouville measure in 2d-Liouville quantum gravity or thick points of the Gaussian Free Field have appeared in many branches.

While the primary focus is on theoretical properties of such matrices, the questions are motivated by applications in other sciences: economics, statistics, and physics. In data sciences, rectangular arrays appear whenever the observations are naturally arranged in two dimensions, for instance, in time and space. In quantum mechanics, matrices and related operators appear in modelling of a physical system. When the amount of available information about such a system is limited, a proper modelling is by taking the matrix to be random. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Random matrices and their eigenvalues play a central role in many research areas, including high-energy physics, growth models, number theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The project revolves around exactly solvable or integrable families of random matrices, for which the eigenvalues are accessible through explicit formulas, actions of differential operations, orthogonal polynomials, and other essentially algebraic techniques. The goal of this project is three-fold: to search for these families, develop delicate asymptotic results about them (which usually go far beyond theorems available for generic systems), and use them for obtaining asymptotic predictions for much wider classes of random matrices and related objects of applied interest. The central objects gluing together different parts of the project are beta-ensembles, which are N-dimensional distributions uniting and generalizing the laws of eigenvalues of various random matrices. While in classical contexts the parameter beta takes values 1, 2, or 4, depending on whether the matrices under consideration are real, complex, or are quaternion matrices, this project emphasize a point of view  in which beta is allowed to take arbitrary positive real values and should be interpreted as the inverse temperature in the terminology of statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Study of various spatial and non-spatial random graph models, stochastic spatial models, and stochastic processes taking place on random graphs, and network-based algorithms are key to these efforts. Although these problems have received significant attention in the literature, rigorous analysis and foundational work is needed in many areas to have reliable results and to cope with upcoming challenges and the complexity of real-world data. This research addresses several theoretical and some empirical challenges involving a wide class of questions arising in physics, social sciences, and biosciences. Specific research areas that would benefit from this research include determining functional connectivity within neural networks in brains, pandemic management, pest control strategies, and the evolution of social interactions. This research will provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinning of the underlying complex structures and associated covariates on different social and biological phenomena which are the central objective of research in many disciplines. This analysis will help scientists to understand experimental and observational data in biosciences and social sciences and develop suitable control strategies.  Community detection for temporal networks would enhance the understanding of brain function across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The proposed work also has significant potential to increase our capacity to develop efficient and cost-effective intervention strategies to mitigate some of the most potentially damaging and fastest-spreading invasive epidemics of humans, livestock, and plants (including wheat, soybean, citrus, and hop).  To guarantee that the results are relevant to scientists, parts of the project will be carried out in collaboration with scientists of different fields. Presentations on the relevant research will be given in stakeholder meetings and community outreach events. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research activities at the intersection of mathematics and other disciplines. Opportunities to learn theoretical and empirical analysis of various probabilistic models, and interactions with scientists will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and various related areas. <br/> <br/>One of the primary goals of this project is to understand and analyze different structural properties and limiting behavior of various spatial and non-spatial random graph models, and several stochastic dynamics taking place on graphs. The random graph models include open clusters of percolation and related models, multi-layer, and temporal network models. Percolation models originated in the physics literature as a model for a porous medium. There are many useful tools and a well-developed theory for studying the percolation models on two-dimensional lattices. However, for higher dimensional lattices, several key aspects, including the near-critical regime and the behavior of the model in subgraphs such as sectors, are poorly understood. This project will address some of these issues. Multi-layer networks are natural models for numerous datasets arising in various scientific fields, including genomics, biomedical sciences, neuroscience, economics, sociology, ecology, epidemiology, and technological networks. Depending on the context, various parametric probabilistic models have been used for the formation of multi-layer, multiplex, and temporal networks. For the estimation of those parameters from data, and for model selection purposes, it is very important to understand the behavior of some key functionals (e.g., subgraph counts or the concentration of aggregated adjacency matrices). These functionals will be analyzed for a wide variety of temporal network models, particularly where the snapshots have some correlation structure. The stochastic dynamics include some important variants of the standard models for infection spreading and opinion evolution in presence of additional restrictions (e.g., temporary isolation). The project also includes studying several theoretical and empirical aspects (e.g., bounds for detectability threshold, efficient detection algorithms) of various detection problems, which includes detection of anomalous structures, community detection from a correlated sequence of networks, detection of the source of the epidemic. The rigorous analyses of the models discussed above will require the development of novel mathematical techniques and research tools. These techniques and tools would be instrumental to obtain a deeper understanding of a broader class of random structures and dynamics arising in multiple scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LDT is concerned with estimating the probabilities of rare events, and understanding the mechanisms by which these events arise. One of the main focuses of the project is on rare events for random networks. Random networks are large collections of nodes (or individuals) where pairs of nodes are connected at random. The  project aims to describe the large-scale structure of random networks with an atypical number of instances of some small-scale pattern, such as three mutual friends. Such an understanding would have implications for statistical estimation of the structure of large social networks. The second aim of the project concerns extreme values for logarithmically correlated fields (LCFs), which arise in problems ranging from analytic number theory to mathematical ecology. The project aims to advance the understanding of universal and non-universal aspects of LCFs in the context of random matrices and reaction-diffusion systems. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/> <br/>The problems concerning LDT focus on questions about nonlinear functions of random hypergraphs and random matrices. The project will further develop a recent approach to LDT for random hypergraphs based on tensor decompositions, with connections to the regularity method in extremal graph theory and the mean-field approximation in statistical physics, and with applications to the study of Gibbs measures used to model social networks. In the context of random matrices, the project will further advance a recent approach to large deviations of extremal eigenvalues through the analysis of spherical integrals, in order to address models with general entry distributions, including sparse models. The project on extreme values for LCFs aims to develop flexible tools to study a broad class of models in random matrix theory, where the strongest results to date are confined to classical ensembles with smooth symmetries. In a different direction, the project will extend a probabilistic approach to the study of reaction-diffusion equations in order to study coupled systems of partial differential equations in higher dimensions with boundary interactions, with particular attention to systems used to model the propagation of invasive species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research involves the development of general theory for some broad classes of stochastic networks and the study of questions directly motivated by specific applications. Since the complexity of stochastic networks usually precludes exact analysis of detailed ?microscopic? models, the focus here is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation are considered: first-order approximations called fluid models, and second-order approximations, which frequently are diffusion models.

Vast stores of information can efficiently be analyzed for underlying patterns by machine learning algorithms, leading to remarkable progress in applications ranging from self-driving cars to automatic drug discovery and machine translation. Underpinning many of these exciting practical developments is a class of computational models called neural networks. Originally developed in the 1940's and 1950's, the neural nets used today are as complex as they are powerful. The purpose of this project is to develop a range of principled techniques for understanding key aspects of how neural networks work in practice and how to make them better. The approach taken by this project is probabilistic and statistical in nature. Just as the ideal gas law accurately describes the large-scale properties of a gas directly through pressure, volume, and temperature without the need specify the state of each individual gas molecule, this project will explore and identify emergent statistical behaviors of large neural networks that provably explain many of their key properties observed in practice. The project will also provide research training and educational opportunities through organization of summer schools in machine learning for graduate students.<br/> <br/>At a high level, a neural network is a family of functions given by composing affine transformations with elementary non-linear operations. The simplest important kind of neural networks are roughly described by two parameters called depth and width. The former is the dimension of the spaces on which the affine transformations act and the latter is the number of compositions. The technical heart of this project is to understand the statistical behavior of such networks when the affine transformations are chosen at random. The starting point is an analytically tractable regime in which the network width is sent to infinity at fixed depth. In this infinite width limit, random networks converge to Gaussian processes and optimization of network parameters from their randomly chosen starting points reduces to a kernel method. Unfortunately, this concise description cannot capture what is perhaps the most important empirical property of neural networks, namely their ability to learn data-dependent features. Understanding how feature learning occurs is at the core of this project and requires new probabilistic and analytic tools for studying random neural networks at finite width. The basic idea is to perform perturbation theory around the infinite width limit, treating the reciprocal of the network width as a small parameter. The goal is then to obtain, to all orders in this reciprocal, the expressions for joint distribution of the values and derivatives (with respect to both model inputs and model parameters) of a random neural network. Such formulas have practical consequences for understanding the numerical stability of neural network training, suggesting principled settings for optimization hyper-parameters, and quantifying feature learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these models have remarkable algebraic and combinatorial properties, which makes their study tractable.

The second direction of the project is to establish universal scaling limits for Gibbsian line ensembles. Various integrable models, such as Hall-Littlewood processes and the log-gamma polymer, naturally carry a structure of a line ensemble and it is expected that these ensembles converge to the parabolic Airy line ensemble (one of the universal scaling limits in the KPZ universality class) -- the project seeks to establish this statement. The third direction of the project is to utilize loop equations to understand the scaling limits of multi-level interacting particle systems, which are discrete analogues of the beta-corners processes from random matrix theory and are related to Jack symmetric functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems arise from problems in queuing networks, evolutionary biology, mathematical finance, and other areas of science. The goal of the work is to understand the behavior of such systems as the number of particles becomes large and/or when the system is in operation for a long time. One is interested in characterizing typical behavior, probabilities of fluctuations from the typical behavior, and also of non-typical large deviations from the expected behavior. The work will lead to an understanding of divergence of predictions based on deterministic models from the actual noisy systems and provide guidance for operating procedures that incorporate the associated uncertainties. It will also provide insight on properties of these systems over suitable spatial and temporal scales. The project includes research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>Under suitable scaling, hydrodynamical limits of empirical measures of such particle systems can be characterized through partial differential equations (PDE) for Stefan type free boundary problems (FBP). Several types of asymptotic problems associated with such particle systems will be studied. These include hydrodynamic limits, diffusion approximations, large deviation principles, and ergodicity behavior under suitable scaling of space, volume and time. Work on large deviations will require the development of the theory for families of measure valued processes whose scaling limits are described through FBP. A key component will be the development of the uniqueness theory for families of controlled FBP and an analysis of Euler-Lagrange equations associated with certain calculus of variations problems. In another direction, the local stability structure of extremal invariant distributions of some infinite particle versions of these systems will be studied. In addition to this being a fundamental problem in the ergodic theory of infinite dimensional Markov processes, here it also arises from applications to load balancing algorithms for large queuing systems. The behavior of multiplicity of invariant distributions for infinite particle systems has counterparts in other interacting particle systems. Examples include multiplicity of traveling wave solutions of FBP associated with scaling limits of certain types of particle systems, and multiplicity of quasi-stationary distributions associated with Markov processes with absorption approximated by Fleming-Viot type particle systems. These related multiplicity phenomena will be investigated by studying scaling limits under different types of initial configurations and time and space scaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to elucidate the connection between phase transitions in the underlying statistical physics model and the computational complexity of these two problems.  The project features an integrated research and education plan, with the complementary goals of advancing fundamental knowledge of Gibbs measures and improving interdisciplinary mathematical education.

Stochastic spatial models are important for applications, so it is important to develop methods to understand their qualitative behavior. For many systems like the contact process, which is a simple model of the spread and competition of species, the nontrivial stationary distribution is unique and its density is a continuous function of its parameters. The research carried out in this project will investigate some systems that are exceptions to this rule. The PI's work on nonlinear voter models seeks to produce examples that can be rigorously shown to have two nontrivial translation invariant equilibrium states. The PI has recently shown that a susceptible-infected epidemics in which individuals drop connections to infected individuals can have a discontinuous phase transition. One of the goals is to extend this to the more realistic SIR model. In the other direction there is a process called explosive percolation that was conjectured in 2009 based on simulation to have a discontinuous transition, but one year later a rigorous mathematical proof showed that this system and a number of similar systems have continuous phase transitions. One of the goals of this project will seek to prove qualitative results about the phase transition in the explosive percolation model. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Work will be carried out on four challenging and long-studied problems in probability. For brevity only three are mentioned here: (i) Explosive percolation occurs on a dynamically grown random graph in which m potential new edges are chosen on each step but only is chosen to be added. Achlioptas, D?Souza and Spencer claimed in 2009 that these models could have discontinuous transitions, but one year later Riordan and Warnke showed that for a broad class of rules the transition is continuous. One of the goals of this project is to extend their results to other systems and to obtain more detailed information about the phase transition. (ii) In many cases the existence of stationary distributions for a stochastic spatial model has been proved by showing that the particle systems converge to reaction diffusion equations with positive wave speed. Recently Huang and Durrett have shown that several particle systems that converge to reaction-diffusion equations with zero wave speeds converge to motion by mean curvature as time is further sped-up. This opens up the possibility of proving the existence of discontinuous phase transitions. (iii) Durrett and Yao have recently given an almost necessary and sufficient condition for a discontinuous phase transition in the SI model on an evolving configuration model graph. One of the aims of this project is to extend this result to more realistic SIR and SIS epidemics. The latter question is a long standing open problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the primary focus is on theoretical properties of such matrices, the questions are motivated by applications in other sciences: economics, statistics, and physics. In data sciences, rectangular arrays appear whenever the observations are naturally arranged in two dimensions, for instance, in time and space. In quantum mechanics, matrices and related operators appear in modelling of a physical system. When the amount of available information about such a system is limited, a proper modelling is by taking the matrix to be random. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Random matrices and their eigenvalues play a central role in many research areas, including high-energy physics, growth models, number theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The project revolves around exactly solvable or integrable families of random matrices, for which the eigenvalues are accessible through explicit formulas, actions of differential operations, orthogonal polynomials, and other essentially algebraic techniques. The goal of this project is three-fold: to search for these families, develop delicate asymptotic results about them (which usually go far beyond theorems available for generic systems), and use them for obtaining asymptotic predictions for much wider classes of random matrices and related objects of applied interest. The central objects gluing together different parts of the project are beta-ensembles, which are N-dimensional distributions uniting and generalizing the laws of eigenvalues of various random matrices. While in classical contexts the parameter beta takes values 1, 2, or 4, depending on whether the matrices under consideration are real, complex, or are quaternion matrices, this project emphasize a point of view  in which beta is allowed to take arbitrary positive real values and should be interpreted as the inverse temperature in the terminology of statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each workshop extends over three days, and the conference will consist of three periods, each period featuring 7 mathematically diverse but interconnected workshops, with 21 workshops in total. These activities combined with poster sessions and informal interactions among participants all synthesize forefront research with mentoring and training opportunities for young participants, helping them develop networks that include the world?s leading researchers. A number of themes connect the diverse workshop topics, such as learning from computation to automate, adapt and optimize the computational process which by itself becomes an analysis tool, ties from homotopy methods used in computational algebraic geometry for systems of algebraic equations and interior point methods in continuous optimization to numerical methods for differential equations and aspects of differential geometry, machine learning and signal processing cast as very large and challenging convex optimization problems, common themes among symbolic algorithms used for the solution of algebraic and differential equations, and relationships between decidability and tractability in real/complex arithmetic computational models and the Turing machine models considered in the context of combinatorics and intractability as well as discrete optimization.
