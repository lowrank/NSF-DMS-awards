In game theory, random walks can model shuffling a deck of cards to find optimal shuffle iterations. In finance, the unpredictability of price changes of stocks can be modeled by random walks. The project will apply rigorous mathematical tools for studying the long-term behavior of random walks. In particular, the following two problems will be investigated: first, how geometric or algebraic features can capture the long-term behavior of random walks. Second, how different quantities can describe the long-term behavior of a random walk. The research will engage undergraduate and graduate students. This engagement with students exposes them to contemporary areas of mathematics not part of the regular curriculum. <br/><br/>The work will expand and refine existing results on random walk invariants such as boundaries and asymptotic entropies. These arise from the interaction between random walks on groups and their algebraic or geometric structures. The project will improve understanding of the Poisson boundary, which provides a representation of bounded harmonic functions on a group for a given probability measure. The current work will leverage recent developments, such as the theory of pivotal times, to identify the Poisson boundary of random walks on hyperbolic-like groups. Another goal is to investigate connections between quotients of the Poisson boundaries with subgroups of a given group. The area of research has strong connections to geometric group theory, ergodic theory, and information theory.

This class is called the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, and it models many real-world phenomena, such as fire propagation, traffic flow, or disordered polymer chains. It has been conjectured and partially proved that all models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class exhibit the same limiting behaviors. Understanding these behaviors has become an important area in probability theory and more generally in mathematics. The awardee mentors graduate and undergraduate students and is engaged in educational outreach.<br/><br/>The height functions of models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class are expected to converge to a limiting space-time fluctuation field, which is called the KPZ fixed point. Moreover, there is a random directed metric on the space-time plane that is expected to govern all the models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This directed metric is called the directed landscape. While both the KPZ fixed point and the directed landscape are central to the study of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, they have only been characterized very recently. The project aims to study these random fields using the approach of exact formulas. The research will first focus on finding  exact formulas for the limiting fields in certain exactly solvable models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, such as the directed last passage percolation; these formulas can be used to understand probabilistic properties of the limiting fields. A second goal of this project is to extend the approaches described above to periodic domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These processes are typically modeled using the statistical mechanics approach, i.e. by considering large systems of interacting particles, where each particle corresponds to a molecule or an individual bacterium. Imprecision of our measurements and dependence of physical processes on many factors are typically described by random perturbations of particles. Large-scale behavior of such models is observed when one looks at the systems from a sufficiently large distance, after a sufficiently long period of time. Universality in this case refers to the fact that such growing interfaces exhibit similar large-scale behavior. Description of this universal behavior gives a better understanding of the real physical processes in nature. Recent breakthroughs in probability theory, particularly in stochastic partial differential equations and integrable probability, have provided the tools to study such mathematical models.<br/><br/>The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality arises in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, when studying limiting behavior of random growing interfaces. On the mathematical level, growing interfaces appear in free energies of directed random polymers, random growth models, interacting particle systems, stochastic Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. Depending on the characteristics of models, two universal objects are conjectured to govern such interfaces: the KPZ equation and the KPZ fixed point. Recent developments in the area of stochastic PDEs allow to prove scaling limits of various discrete systems to singular stochastic PDEs. Moreover, methods of integrable probability (exactly solvable models) provided a complete characterization of the KPZ fixed point. The goal of this project is to study universal scaling limits of such random growing interfaces using these new results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Probabilistic models are widespread in fields like biology, statistical physics, quantum mechanics, and machine learning. Examples include models of cancer growth, spread of disease in population, governing principles of subatomic particles, black holes, neural networks, etc. The purpose of this project is to understand the geometry and intrinsic properties of a string of models that are representatives of these examples. The project aims to resolve open questions in those fields based on tools that the investigator has developed. <br/><br/>Domino tilings, random matrices, and stochastic six vertex models are areas of intense interest in the field of statistical physics, while Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) and theory of optimal transport have gained immense attention in the fields of quantum mechanics and machine learning. This project revolves around questions in those areas and aims to acquire new insights about their geometry and integrability. In particular, this project plans to: (1) find laws of iterated logarithms and fractal dimension of models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class including the KPZ fixed point, edge spectrum of random matrices, and domino tilings; (2) build a unified framework for studying the moment formulas of interacting particle systems and vertex models including the stochastic six vertex model; (3) rigorously prove modular transformation properties of conformal blocks of LCFT and partition functions from gauge theory; and (4) study the convergence of entropically regularized optimal transport to optimal transport when the regularization vanishes. By intermingling ideas from various fields including geometry of polymers, representation theory, Riemann-Hilbert techniques, quantum groups, and convex geometry, the investigator aims to resolve questions that were hard to tackle with other methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Matrices are one of the most basic mathematical objects. They encode multivariate linear functions and can serve as approximations to more complicated multivariate functions. The eigenvalues of a square matrix describe how the corresponding linear transformation shrinks or stretches the space in certain special directions. One of the central problems in random matrix theory is to understand the scaling properties of the eigenvalues of a growing sequence of randomly chosen square matrices. This is a highly active area of probability, with a number of interesting connections to other fields within mathematics. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research, including projects at the Madison Experimental Mathematics Lab, and the awardee is involved in developing the graduate and undergraduate probability curriculum at the University of Wisconsin. <br/><br/>The project builds on recent results of the awardee and collaborators on random operator representations of limits of random matrices and their characteristic polynomials.  The idea is to represent random matrices as certain discretized differential operators and to study the limit of their eigenvalues via the limit of the operators themselves. This approach also provides tools to analyze the limits of characteristic polynomials of random matrices using the framework of functional and stochastic analysis. The project investigates various properties of the random analytic functions obtained as such limits. It also studies various deformations and generalizations of random matrix models that are amenable to the random operator approach, with the goals of discovering new and interesting limit objects and learning more about the original models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The utility of random matrices lies in the universality of their eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics for very large matrices. This phenomenon depends only on the underlying symmetry and is independent of the law of individual entries. This research project aims to broaden understanding of the universality phenomenon of random matrices and to develop new tools and techniques for more applications of random matrix theory.  <br/><br/>The project will explore two research directions related to random matrix theory. In the first direction, the project aims to understand the spectral properties of adjacency matrices of random d-regular graphs. The sparsity and dependency among entries make the analysis of such models more challenging than that for Wigner-type random matrices. The investigator and collaborators previously proved the universality of the local spectral statistics for sparse random graphs with growing degrees. The project's goal is to understand the local statistics of random d-regular graphs with fixed degree, particularly the fluctuations of extreme eigenvalues of random d-regular graphs. This will provide insights for the universality phenomenon for extremely sparse systems and is expected to have applications in theoretical computer science. In the second direction, the investigator aims to study statistical learning models, such as deep neural networks and tensor models. Even though these models are built out of random matrices and random tensors, the powerful machinery of random matrix theory has so far found limited success in studying them, due to the nonlinearity.  This project seeks to develop random matrix theory to incorporate nonlinearity and open the door for more applications of random matrix theory to statistical learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, they play a key role in big data algorithms.  In many of these contexts, randomness enters the system only through a limited number of directions in space.  This sparsity of randomness and the often high or infinite-dimensional nature of the equations lead to numerous mathematical challenges, from obtaining basic structural properties of to establishing finer aspects of the dynamics. This project will explore how the limited randomness interacts with nonlinearity to produce smoothing, leading to criteria for the existence of solutions and equilibria.  The work will focus on fluid models with random forcing terms, where very little is known about such behavior.  Finer properties of the stochastic dynamics will also be studied, especially how fast the system converges to equilibrium as certain parameters in the system are removed.  The aim in this context is to understand the anomalous dissipation phenomenon in fluids. The planned work will involve postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Further synergistic activities will include an online cross-university research reading group and a probability reading group at Iowa State University.    <br/><br/><br/>This project encompasses several topics at the interface of stochastic analysis and dynamical systems.   Diffusions with degenerate noise in both high and infinite dimensions will be studied.  A key goal is to understand how noise interacts with nonlinearities to produce smoothing, in the sense that the dynamics belongs to an improved Sobolev space for positive times, and convergence, in the sense that the system settles into a unique statistically steady state for large times.  Such understanding is fundamental for deducing basic structural properties of solutions (e.g. large-time existence/ergodicity in the relevant topology), yet it is absent in many important models in turbulence and statistical mechanics.  Finer properties of such systems (e.g. classification of irregular points, the meaning of ""hypoellipticty"" in infinite dimensions, and the anomalous dissipation phenomenon) will also be studied.  Many of the equations to be investigated are physical models (e.g. the two-dimensional stochastically forced and damped Euler equations or second-order Langevin dynamics), while others are simplified models to help build understanding in the motivating equations.  This work will build on previous research of the awardee by developing methods to analyze the systems for both large and bounded values of the phase space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most realistic systems including those arising from biology, environmental science, engineering, physics, medicine and financial markets exhibit randomness in their behavior. Accurate analysis of such systems thus needs differential equations that can incorporate this randomness. Stochastic differential equations are powerful tools for this purpose. Understanding behaviors of these systems requires not just building mathematical models but integrating them with available data. This in turn requires various types of learning algorithms. It is important to judge the effectiveness of these algorithms by rigorous mathematical analysis, which is the primary objective of this project. The dynamics of these stochastic systems are however intricate with convoluted correlation structures, and there is a critical lack of mathematical results in the literature investigating learning methods for such complex data. The work done by the investigator will fill some of this gap by deriving mathematical results that will not only be able to answer if the algorithms become more accurate with data observed over longer periods of time but will be able to provide valuable insight on how to fine-tune the key parameters for optimal efficiency.  Building such data-driven stochastic models backed by rigorous mathematics enhances our understanding of complex systems across multiple domains and empowers informed decision-making in the presence of randomness.  The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will teach them valuable skills through a combination of theoretical knowledge, practical application, and hands-on experience with coding. It will enable them to excel in the digital age and adapt to the demands of an increasingly data-driven and technologically advanced world.  The results of the project will be disseminated through publications in well-known scientific journals and presentations at domestic and international conferences.<br/><br/>The project will study important learning problems for a broad class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These problems lie on the interface of stochastic analysis and statistical learning theory, and there is a paucity of theoretical results in probability, statistics and machine learning literature addressing them. The project is divided into three interconnected parts, each of which plays an important role in the other. Part I will address important problems on parametric inference including point estimation and testing of hypotheses. It will derive asymptotic results including law of large numbers, central limit theorems and large deviation principles for estimators of a finite dimensional parameter of a broad class of SDEs. Unlike some existing works in this direction which assume data to be in the form of a continuous trajectory, the investigator's work will consider the realistic case of availability of only discrete data points. Since asymptotic analysis requires the time horizon to go to infinity, the effect of time-gap (or discretization step) between the observations on the accuracy of these estimators over long time is not clear, and it is known that naive discretization of estimators based on a continuous trajectory of an SDE can lead to erroneous inference. The project will introduce appropriate scaling frameworks to quantify this effect and analyze the errors in different scaling regimes. Next, these results will be utilized to design tests for composite hypotheses-testing problems so that the probability of type I error decays rapidly and which are asymptotically uniformly powerful within a class of tests having similar level of type I error. Part II of the project concerns itself with the important topic of decision-making. Decision-making involves (constrained) minimization of suitable cost functions depending on model parameters.  Since these latter quantities are unknown, data-driven versions of such minimization problems are necessary in practice. In particular, it is necessary to construct suitable estimators of the cost functions so that decisions based on their minimization are close to the true decisions. The investigator will study a novel approach based on large deviation analysis and results of Part I which aims to guarantee that under appropriate conditions this can be achieved with a very high probability. Part III is devoted to nonparametric learning of SDEs. The last part falls in the realm of infinite-dimensional learning theory where the goal is to learn the entire driving functions of the SDE-based models as opposed to estimating finite-dimensional parameters. A rigorous computational framework combining Bayesian techniques with the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space will be developed toward this end, and the theoretical properties of the resulting learning algorithms will also be studied.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Principal Investigator (PI) will consider various models of random matrices with the goal of obtaining results that hold with very high probability. Graphs (collections of points connected by edges) have been extensively used as models of communication networks and of data organization. For example, social networks and the World Wide Web can be efficiently modeled as random graphs. Understanding characteristics of random walks on graphs helps to evaluate the speed of information exchange in networks. Moreover, random walks on certain graphs have been used for sampling, that is, constructing typical instances of complex objects. The PI will study properties of random walks on graphs by employing tools of functional analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>The two main parts of this research are analysis of singular spectrum and eigenvalues of certain models of square random matrices, and functional inequalities on graphs.

Further, the PI will consider limiting laws for the spectrum of random matrices for previously unexplored models. The tools developed as part of this research should find applications in other problems within combinatorial and non-asymptotic random matrix theory.

For instance, in most recommendation systems, the rows of the matrix represent customers, and the columns represent products, the entries are the (potential) rating of a customer for the corresponding product. Since data comes with noise, it is important to measure the impact of noise on the information we would like to deduce (in most cases, in terms of some matrix parameters). Given the popularity of the spectral method in data science, the problem has been studied by scientists across many fields for a century. However, in modern data science, it has been observed that very often, the data matrix has some structure, such as being low rank. The PI aims to develop a new theory with this restriction, which would improve many classical mathematical results, and at the same time, would lead to better estimates and faster algorithms for many real-life problems. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Consider a matrix (which represents data). In practice, we often have access to a noise version of it, where each entry is added with some noise (or the whole matrix is added to a noise matrix). Classical perturbation theorems, such as Weyl or Davis-Kahan, provide us with estimates for the difference between key parameters of the original matrix (such as leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors) and their noisy counterparts. These results are sharp in worst cases analysis. However, in modern data science, data often has a low-rank structure, and noise is random. Under these assumptions, the PI has observed that one can provide much better bounds. Under this project, the PI will obtain optimal bounds under the above assumption, in various norms. The PI and his students will also attack several well-known algorithmic problems, such as matrix completion and Gaussian mixtures, using the spectral method combined with these new tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data often presents itself as the so-called time series, also known as stochastic processes, evolutions of measurable quantities over periods of time. The variations of these time series can be rather predictable from one period to the next, but less so over longer time intervals covering many periods. There are subtle differences in the nature of various types of these stochastic processes. For instance, the value of a financial stock or index, or the yearly global mean temperature, are buildups, accumulating stochastically over time. But daily returns on stocks or commodities futures, or the category (intensity) of successive Atlantic hurricanes, are of a different nature, typically showing a great deal of independence from one day or one event to the next, featuring a property of stationarity over time after adjusting for trends and seasonality. A critically important question is how some of these time series relate to each other. For instance, are global mean temperatures closely tied to Atlantic hurricane activity? Climate scientists would talk about significant attribution of the latter to the former if the relation is statistically significant. We have discovered that ordinary statistical tools work well to measure attribution when time series are largely stationary, but that the same tools can incorrectly point to a strong attribution when none actually exists, for time series, which are more accumulative. This incorrect attribution phenomenon, measured using a so-called correlation coefficient, occurs more frequently in scientific papers than one would hope. It is known as Yule's ""nonsense correlation"" in honor of the famed British statistician who first described the possibility empirically in 1926. Our work is the first to quantify exactly how this correlation can behave as a mathematical object, for accumulative time series, and for stationary time series. As a consequence of this award's work, we will provide scientists with demonstrably correct tools for correlations of time series, which will help them measure with great precision whether natural and societal phenomena, such as those described above, are statistically related, or whether they are more likely to be independent of each other. The project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/> <br/> <br/>As is a well-accepted direction when developing tools for statistical inference, this award's work will study the properties of statistical tests which detect whether data streams are likely not to be independent. The objects of study are pairs of paths of times series or stochastic processes, and the empirical Pearson-type correlation statistic for any such pair. In particular, the work will apply to observational studies, rather than repeated experiments, since single time series are often the only type of data for any given environmental or economic variable. For stationary stochastic processes, we will derive precise estimates of the empirical correlation's fluctuations, by using calculations involving both exact distribution theory and normal approximations via stochastic analysis. These results will lead directly to proposing principled statistical methods for distinguishing between dependent and independent of pairs of stochastic processes. Next, we will investigate the realm of highly non-stationary paths, including random walks and Brownian motion, how the asymptotics for the empirical correlations deviate strongly from normality, and how to convert this information to the aforementioned application to distinguish between dependence and independence. Much of our work will draw on the distributional properties of classical variance and covariance objects for Gaussian vectors, as a technical aspect of stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These equations have applications in many fields, ranging from physics and chemistry to biology and financial markets. Key examples include the stochastic heat equation (SHE), the parabolic Anderson model (PAM), and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. These equations and their variants model crucial phenomena such as the spread of forest fires, smoke dispersal, growth of tumor tissues, superconductivity, and the formation of the universe's stratified structure and magnetic fields of planets or stars. This project will deepen our understanding of these phenomena by establishing essential properties of solutions, such as existence and uniqueness, moment asymptotics, positivity and support of solutions, existence and smoothness of probability density. Active efforts will be made to encourage participation by students from underrepresented groups in this research program, fostering an inclusive and diverse research environment. The investigator also participates in outreach programs for pre-college students. <br/><br/>SPDEs depend on many technical parameters and conditions, including initial conditions, noise structures, conditions on the diffusion coefficients, geometric and analytic properties of the spatial domain and the corresponding boundary conditions, differential operators, among others.

Obtaining comprehensive and accurate information about these models is crucial for gaining a systematic understanding of the modeled system and for designing effective problem-solving strategies. The objective of this project is to provide fresh perspectives in the study of recently proposed models in various areas of mathematical physics and finance. The underlying concept is to establish a connection between a simple stochastic dynamic, which is easily analyzable and well-understood, and a family of complex stochastic models. This connection allows for the transfer of fundamental properties from the reference model to the entire family. To achieve this, the project aims to deepen the understanding of classification schemes can connect models of disparate phenomena. In fact, all stochastic models within a class are linked solely by a set of points known as the spectrum, which remains independent of the dynamics' structure. In addition to theoretical development, this project also incorporates a computational component: its goal is to develop precise and efficient numerical schemes for simulating such complex models. Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate, in an inclusive learning environment where students can contribute and gain valuable experience. The awardee will also organize conferences, facilitating opportunities for scholars and researchers to collaborate.<br/><br/>By combining theoretical insights with practical computational methods, this project strives to advance the understanding and applicability of general Markov semigroups on Hilbert spaces.

This methodology aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various orbits exhibited by these semigroups. Second to utilize the aforementioned classification schemes to identify analytical, ergodic, and mixing properties that can be transferred from the reference semigroup to its corresponding orbit. Particular emphasis will be placed on studying Markov processes residing in subsets of Euclidean space and Weyl chambers, with the goal of conducting an in-depth analysis of dynamical determinantal point processes.

Three specific areas of interest are random matrix theory, numerical linear algebra, and modern scientific computing. Established experts and promising junior researchers will present the latest advances and state-of-the-art techniques. We seek a fruitful exchange of ideas and the opportunity to interact across disciplinary boundaries. This interaction will be facilitated by the presence of numerous researchers who work at the intersection of two or more of these areas. In addition to the presentations, we have scheduled a poster session for young participants so they can publicize their results and receive feedback and guidance from the experts in the audience. <br/><br/>Random matrix theory, with its myriad modern applications from randomized numerical linear algebra to signal processing and from optimization to machine learning, is informed and deepened by computational and numerics tricks of the sort that have yielded tridiagonal theoretical models for beta-ensembles and calculating limiting distributions via Kolmogorov's backward equation. On the other hand, the use of randomization in numerical linear algebra is a fast-growing subfield, due to the importance of working with extremely large datasets for which classical, deterministic algorithms are too slow. The new methods make extensive use of random matrix tools, while the need to properly address machine learning and optimization applications has in turn guided the modern development of random matrix theory. Finally, modern high-performance computing needs to deal with sparseness, structure, and fast and accurate approximation on the back end, and must allow the users to write code that reads like mathematics on the front end; modern programming languages like Julia are designed to allow for high-level mathematical abstraction with high-performance code.

The first method will exploit the intuition that in many practical situations, although the system contains numerous degrees of freedom, the relevant information is contained in a much smaller set of variables. The project will aim to quantify this intuition by developing the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. The second method aims to represent a given complex system as the transformation of a much simpler system.

This omission can lead to inefficient functional inequalities; this project hopes to bridge this gap. The second approach is to develop new measure transportation methods based on stochastic processes and probabilistic flows. For example, Lipschitz transport maps provide a powerful way to transfer functional inequalities from simple source measures to complicated target measures. Only a few such Lipschitz transport maps are known to exist, which limits the applicability of the transport method.

The second method aims to represent a given complex system as the transformation of a much simpler system. The project also includes educational efforts, including mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and the dissemination of the work in professional meetings and to the public. <br/><br/>The long-term goal is to improve understanding of high-dimensional probability measures via two approaches.  The first approach is to develop an original concept of intrinsic dimensionality in the context of functional inequalities. The notion of dimension plays a crucial role in functional inequalities via the curvature-dimension condition, but it ignores the fact that the measures of interest can live on lower-dimensional spaces. This omission can lead to inefficient functional inequalities; this project hopes to bridge this gap. The second approach is to develop new measure transportation methods based on stochastic processes and probabilistic flows. For example, Lipschitz transport maps provide a powerful way to transfer functional inequalities from simple source measures to complicated target measures. Only a few such Lipschitz transport maps are known to exist, which limits the applicability of the transport method. The project will utilize the tools of stochastic analysis and renormalization group methods to build transport maps with desirable regularity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is of great importance to study fluctuations and large deviations from the typical or mean behavior of these systems. Indeed, fluctuations and atypical events, although rare, can have significant impact, so it is important to quantify these probabilities and to understand typical occurrences of rare events.  A significant mathematical challenge is to see how the structure of interaction between large collections of stochastic elements influences the nature of such deviations. This project will address this challenge for three classes of stochastic systems. The first class consists of large collections of interacting diffusions that arise as models of stock prices in finance, as continuum models of population dynamics in biology, and in statistical physics.  The second class concerns high-dimensional measures, such as random ensembles of matrices arising as representations of high-dimensional data, and their relation to lower-dimensional projections, which are used as a dimension-reduction technique when analyzing data.  Understanding the statistics and deviations of lower-dimensional projections is not only relevant for statistics and data science but also has significance for some open conjectures in convex geometry.  The third class pertains to the study of fluctuations of eigenvectors of random matrices and addresses hypotheses related to quantum mechanical systems. The project will include vertically integrated mentoring of junior researchers at multiple levels and outreach efforts to foster broadening the mathematical participation of underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. <br/><br/>This project will study high-dimensional stochastic systems and work to characterize fluctuations and large deviations from mean behavior and the nature of rare events in such systems. Three classes of problems will be considered. The first focuses on large collections of diffusions whose local interaction structure is governed by an underlying graph, and aims to study their atypical or large deviation behavior.  While this has been well understood for almost half a century in the case when the underlying graph is the complete graph, the goal of this project is to study the complementary case when the graphs are (uniformly) sparse, which is also the relevant regime for many applications. This will require a combination of tools from random graph theory, stochastic analysis and variational methods. The second class of problems relates to the study of concentration and large deviation behavior of projections of high-dimensional convex bodies, with a focus on non-commutative settings, such as the level sets of norms of Banach spaces of matrices such as the p-Schatten spaces. The relation to some outstanding conjectures in convex geometry will also be explored. The third theme concerns the study of universality of the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis from physics, which is a statement about eigenvectors of random matrices, and corresponding fluctuations.  These problems address fundamental problems in probability theory and have applications to statistical physics, asymptotic convex geometry and statistics. The project will employ a combination of analytical, geometric and probabilistic methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of this project is to understand important models for growth in random media, both in terms of developing statistical distributions associated with the models and in terms of understanding in what sort of systems these models are relevant. The project will leverage new tools to solve previously inaccessible problems. The project includes a range of broader impact activities, including the organization of scientific, education, diversity/equity/inclusion, and outreach programs; advising and mentoring junior researchers; and serving on editorial and scientific boards and committees. <br/><br/>Stochastic PDEs, random walks in random media, interacting particle systems, six vertex model, and Gibbs states are active areas of study within probability, equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, combinatorics, analysis and representation theory. This project touches on problems in and draws upon tools from each of these areas. In particular, this project will probe (1) the nature of invariant measures and mixing times for various growth models in contact with boundaries, (2) the behavior of multi-class particle systems and the propagation of perturbations in growth dynamics, and (3) the fluctuations of interfaces, in particular the likelihood of upper and lower deviation probabilities along with various applications. By marrying integrable structures (e.g. Yang-Baxter equation, symmetric functions, determinantal processes, matrix product ansastz) with probabilistic methods (e.g. couplings, Gibbsian properties, hydrodynamic / stochastic PDE limits) the PI will solve problems in both areas which were previously inaccessible from either approach alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To make effective use of this theory, mathematicians and other practitioners must be able to both infer qualitative large-scale structure from more easily measured system statistics and identify the relationship between these statistics and the parameters governing the model.

For example, randomness is a key ingredient in algorithms used to analyze large data. One of the major questions in such an analysis is understanding if and how a random system converges to an equilibrium. The research in this award will study such convergence depending on the models used. The project includes training graduate students, introducing undergraduate students to research, while the results will be disseminated through publications and presentations at conferences.  <br/>  <br/>The project concerns problems combining probability, analysis, geometry. One of the directions of research is to study limits laws such as small deviations, laws of iterated logarithm and large deviations for hypoelliptic diffusions and random walks. These questions are closely related to the Cameron-Martin-Girsanov type quasi-invariance in hypoelliptic settings, applications to functional inequalities, and smoothness of probability laws in hypoelliptic and singular settings. The methods include diverse probabilistic techniques such as coupling and Dirichlet forms. In particular, research concerns large and small deviations, the Onsager?Machlup functional which can be viewed as an analog of the Lagrangian of a dynamical system, and convergence to equilibrium of a large particle system with singular potentials. Both degeneracy (lack of ellipticity) and high dimensions have to be dealt with new techniques coming from different fields such as probability, ergodic theory and sub-Riemannian geometry. While many of these settings arise naturally in applications, their mathematical analysis is not easy. In addition to the theoretical significance of such questions, some answers have practical uses.
