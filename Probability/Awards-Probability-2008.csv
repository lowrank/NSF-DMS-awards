On the technical level, the focus is on the study of properties of (generally high-dimensional) convex bodies, random matrices, Gaussian measures and processes, and of approximation problems. Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory. A combined, focused effort is expected to bring new insights toward a better understanding of the participants' respective fields of research, which - while related and occasionally overlapping - are not identical and often employ different perspectives.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics encompassing the methods and the problems described above has recently entered a period of rapid growth. In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

The first problem involves the study of heat kernel bounds by stochastic methods. The goal is to find estimates which are independent of dimension and hence applicable to infinite dimensional heat flows.  In the case of hypoelliptic heat kernels, the P.I. is looking for precise heat kernel upper and lower bounds. The second problem is to study the quasi-invariance and smoothness properties of heat kernel measures on infinite dimensional Lie groups. The P.I. hopes to find examples of infinite dimensional subelliptic operators which are hypoelliptic. The proof of these results will rely on the results of the first problem. The third problem relates to the understanding of Euclidean Feynman path integrals by finite dimensional approximations. In particular, it is proposed to carry this program out for super-symmetric path integrals. These results and their generalizations should have ramifications to the Stolz-Teichner program of geometrizing elliptic cohomologies. <br/><br/>In the 1940's, Feynman proposed a beautiful, but highly heuristic, theory for understanding quantum mechanics in terms of the more familiar concepts arising in classical mechanics.   Feynman's heuristic ideas have had a significant influence on the mathematical theory of topology. (Topology is the study of the basic shape properties of surfaces and other more general ""manifolds."") The P.I. will investigate a number of problems related to Feynman's model in the context of elementary particle physics. Despite being studied for 70 plus years, the mathematical foundations of these types of theories are still not well understood and many interesting questions remain open. For example, physicists believe that ""quarks"" should be confined. However, with the current state of the models, the theoretical derivation of quark confinement is out of reach. The specific goals of this proposal are: 1) to use probabilistic techniques to describe qualitative and quantitative behavior of the flow of heat in high dimensional spaces, and 2) to develop methods for understanding the ""super-symmetric Feynman path integral.""  It is hoped that the results developed during this grant period will be applicable to the particle physics models and to mathematical topology. This proposal includes a training component as some of the problems will be given to graduate students.<br/>"

The project considers theoretical and computational aspects associated with possibly non-regular patterns in non-Markovian sequences. Previous work by the PI has shown the existence and uniqueness of optimal Markovian structures to keep track of the number of matches with a given pattern in a random sequence. At a theoretical level, the project aims to identify ergodic Markovian structures in embeddings that result in non-ergodic behavior due to small perturbations, and to use these ergodic structures to characterize the asymptotic distribution of the number of matches with a pattern in a non-Markovian sequence. It also compares the entropy of the optimal Markovian embedding of a non-Markovian sequence with that of the original sequence. At a computational level, the PI aims to apply generating function techniques in conjunction with Markovian embeddings to characterize the joint asymptotic distribution of the number of matches with several patterns. The PI also aims to quantify the error in approximating the number of matches with a pattern in a sequence of a moderate size with that of a Binomial distribution. A secondary goal of the project is to develop a method for the symbolic specification of branching processes that will represent the solutions of non-linear o.d.e.'s probabilistically and to explore new connections between these and the analysis of patterns in non-Markovian sequences.<br/><br/>The analysis of patterns in random sequences lies at the core of several emerging fields such as computational biology, security systems, speech recognition and text mining. Random sequences of characters are used to model diverse phenomena ranging from written text to genomic sequences to audit files. In these, exceptional patterns, i.e., over- or under-represented words, may provide a great deal of insight or knowledge. For instance, a widely used heuristic is that overrepresented patterns in DNA may be key for gene expression whereas underrepresented patterns may interfere with this process. As another example, hackers leave traces of their intrusions into secured databases in audit files and unusual patterns may be used to warn of potential security breaches. However, one cannot assess how truly exceptional a pattern is without a bona fide statistical model of the text in which it is immersed. The prevalent models cannot accommodate the long-range correlations present in most types of text. For example, the characters occurring in written text or audit files follow syntax rules and, in RNA sequences, palindromic structures induced by base-pairing convey genome-wide correlations. Unfortunately, the available techniques to assess how exceptional a pattern is, cannot systematically handle the more realistic models. Furthermore, the PI has recently shown that the widely used paradigm that the number of matches with a pattern in a long text is approximately Gaussian distributed does not necessarily apply when long-range correlations are present. Due to these considerations the PI aims to develop new qualitative and quantitative tools to address systematically the occurrence of highly complex patterns under more realistic statistical models of text.<br/>"

In contrast to the typical manner of studying these as subadditive processes we will view them as interacting particle systems. We will consider several ways of turning first-passage percolation into a Markov process. These processes are new examples of interacting particle systems. We will study these processes on many graphs including Z^d and Delaunay triangulations in R^d. For each of these systems we propose to classify the invariant measures. We feel that studying first passage percolation in this manner is not only this is interesting in its own right, it will also lead to the resolution of conjectures about the original first-passage percolation and Richardson's growth model. These include showing that the number of infinite geodesics in first-passage percolation is infinite and that the boundary of the limiting shape has no sharp corners. For the two type Richardson's model we feel this method will show that coexistence is impossible when the two infections have different speeds. We will also study the connection between last-passage percolation on Z^3 and invariant measures for certain dynamics (called ""totally asymmetric hexagon flipping"") on lozenge tilings of the plane. We will analyze the invariant measures for the totally asymmetric hexagon flipping process and use the invariant measures to study the limiting shape of last-passage percolation in Z^3.<br/><br/>In this proposal we study several processes which model the growth of different objects in space and time. These objects may be different species or populations.  In the models we look at the different objects are expanding and competing for territory.  Our models also assume that two different objects cannot occupy the same area at the same time.  We will study under what rules of  growth it is possible that more than one of the objects survive for an arbitrary large time and conversely under which rules of growth does one object conquer all of the others.

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3. <br/>Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.<br/><br/>Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component."

Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such  RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow one to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and  reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place.<br/><br/><br/>The primary focus of the proposed research is the long term behavior of RWRE (random walks in random environments). More precisely, one looks at random walks on thed-dimensional lattice, whose transition probabilities form a random field indexed by the vertices of the lattice. Not only is the RWRE providing a serious mathematical challenge, many of the results proved in this field, especially in the one dimensional case, stand in sharp contrast with the behavior of classical random walk. For example, in dimension 1, subdiffusive behavior and aging phenomena are present, whereas in high dimension one may construct RWRE's with nonzero (averaged) local drift pointing in one direction while the walk drifts away (with positive speed)in the opposite direction. Some of the mathematical challenge emanates from the fact that in the multidimensional case, conditioned on the transition probabilities random field, the RWRE is not reversible. This precludes the use of much of the available theory of homogenization, and requires the development of new techniques, most notably through the use of regeneration times and of renormalization ideas. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers including Bolthausen, Sznitman, Varadhan, Zerner, and the PI, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Among these one notes the existence of 0-1 laws, laws of large numbers in full generality, transience and recurrence criteria, the existence (or non-existence) of sub-diffusive behavior for high dimension, and the behavior of RWRE's in mixing (as opposed to i.i.d.)environments. One direction of intensive study will be the extension of existing renormalization techniques, in order to fully resolve the perturbative regime of RWRE."

The first class concerns metastability and stochastic resonance for multiscale systems. The general approach to metastability and stochastic resonance in the framework of large deviations was developed in our previous papers. In the case of multiscale systems these notions should be modified. In particular, new effects appear in systems which are close to Hamiltonian and in systems with a small delay. Another class consists of new problems for PDE's with a small parameter and related stochastic processes. To describe the limiting behavior in these classical problems one should consider equations on graphs or open book spaces related to the original problam. Reaction-Diffusion-Advection equations in incompressible fluids, in strongly unisotropic media, and in narrow tubes will be considered. The last class of problems concerns the averaging principle for systems with many degrees of freedom and multiwell Hamiltonians. It turns out that even in pure deteministic systems the slow motion can be, in a sense, stochastic.<br/><br/>Small perturbations of a system which often have negligible effects, when the system considered on a short time interval, can become crucial on larger timescale.

The proposed research is expected to find applications in all of these financial market sectors. Empirically realistic and, at the same time, analytically and computationally tractable models developed in this project will facilitate consistent, fast, and accurate modeling and pricing of financial instruments used to manage market and credit risk. This will help improve efficiency and stability of financial markets. The project is also expected to have a broader mathematical impact on stochastic analysis and applied probability. Analytically tractable time changes of Markov processes developed in this project will provide a useful laboratory for theoretical developments in stochastic analysis, as well as find applications in a variety of areas that employ Markov processes for the modeling of physical, biological, engineering, and economic phenomena. The project will have an impact on education and human resources development.

The investigator will supplement this approach using techniques from hydrodynamics to try to show that the previously obtained survival and coexistence conditions are sharp. A second competition model to be studied is the multitype contact process. The main questions here are also the issues of survival and coexistence of competing types. Another model to be studied is one of gene flow from modified crops into a natural or wild population.

In addition to work on specific models, the investigator will try to extend the validity of some approximation techniques established for some specific models to handle more general ones, thus justifying their use in applications."

The systems include self-avoiding random walks and loops, Ising spin systems, and percolation. Our first approach is through real space renormalization group transformations.  These transformations for Ising type models relate the critical behavior of the model to the behavior of the renormalization group map near the critical point.  This map is not well defined mathematically, and the project will study the mathematical properties of this map.  Our second approach is restricted to two dimensional systems where conformal invariance miraculously appears when there is critical behavior. The research will study the relation between the Schramm-Loewner evolution and various discrete models by studying the Loewner driving process, especially for models which are near but not at their critical point.  The relation of the bi-infinite self-avoiding walk to the newly discovered conformally invariant measures on self-avoiding loops in the plane will also be investigated.<br/><br/>The systems that will be studied contain randomness at a microscopic length scale. For most values of the parameters, e.g., temperature, this randomness is not seen at the macroscopic scale. But for special values of the parameters this microscopic randomness can produce macroscopic effects. This is one characterization of a phase transition. Physicists have developed powerful techniques for studying phase transitions, but the mathematics of these methods is not well understood. This research will further our understanding of critical phenomena by developing the mathematics behind two of the most important of the physicist's tools - the renormalization group and conformal invariance. The research on the renormalization group will focus on the Ising model, arguably the single most important model of the magnetic behavior of crystalline materials.  One product of the research on conformal invariance will be a much faster algorithm for numerically computing conformal maps which are used extensively in science and engineering."

As a first step, the PI proposes to study the widely-used integrate-and-fire model with noise and adaptation. The primary questions include existence and stability of stationary solutions in response to a constant or periodically varying input. The proposal also has an educational component; see below.<br/><br/>Traditionally, many physical systems are modeled with a diffusion process. It is often the case that the medium in which the diffusion occurs possesses certain inhomogeneities (e.g. an electron moving in an allow, waves diffusing in rocks underground, etc). The inclusion of this property makes the model far more realistic and reveals a wide variety of new effects, not present in constant or periodic media.  The main goal of the PI's work is to further the<br/>understanding of the consequences of this disorder in the medium.   <br/>Another part of the PI's research stems from his belief in the need for a stronger involvement of mathematical sciences in the explosive growth of biological research. In particular, the complexity of neuronal network models used in Neuroscience makes their modeling a computationally and analytically challenging task.  A recent technique for analyzing a class of such networks allows to view the population dynamics as a certain diffusion process. The PI proposes to extend this technique to a wider class of neuronal models, including a feedback (adaptation) mechanism.  The results will be applied to specific neurobiological problems, such as localization of moving sound sources and contrast adaptation in vision.  The third component in the proposal is educational. The PI will develop new courses, run seminars and workshops involving local budding scientists, organize undergraduate work on research projects, and actively involve graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in his ongoing research.<br/>"

A particular success story from a physics point of view are mean field(disordered) models, where two levels of randomness are often present, one of whom frozen (quenched), in the form of dependence graph or weights for the resulting stochastic process, whose distribution is exchangeable when averaged over the disorder.

The major objective is to extend the understanding of five related areas and build a general small value theory based on systematic study of various techniques and applications. The isoperimetric type Gaussian inequalities provide comparisons between dependent (complected) structure and independent (simpler) one which becomes an equality in certain (possibility limiting) cases. They have been used as basic tools in various problems and played a crucial role in deeper understanding of random phenomenon. The recent development of several new techniques for Gaussian and closely related random processes broadened our understanding of small deviation probabilities and their connections with related topics of probability such as Gaussian random matrices, non-intersection exponents and random assignments.In turn, it suggests many further questions connected to applications in probability theory and geometric functional analysis. The very successful applications to lower tail probabilities, zeros of random functions and the first exit times will be expanded to a detailed study of Brownian pursuit models and Gaussian chaos.<br/><br/>This research has a broader impact on diverse areas of probability, which is both a fundamental way of viewing the world and a core mathematical discipline.

Network of integrated molecular reactions tend to involve many different molecular species, thus posing complex analytical problems.  For prediction and simulation purposes it is essential to reduce both the model and computational complexity of the problem, while still capturing all the essential characteristics and potential behavior of the network. This project will systematically develop stochastic models for chemical reaction networks, beginning with classical Markov chain models and developing new models that take into account the stepwise development of reactions involving RNA and DNA molecules.  Specific issues to be addressed include scaling limits based on the wide range of time and other quantitative scales in the system, model reduction through scaling limit approximations and other approaches, the implications of the combinatorial restrictions the reaction structure places on the system, sensitivity analysis for the parameters of the stochastic models, and statistical methods for model validation based on data that is frequently obtained through indirect and/or aggregated measurements.<br/><br/>At the level of the cell, the chemical dynamics may well be dominated by the action of regulatory molecules that are present at levels of only a few copies per cell.  Therefore, the molecular fluctuations of these components may determine the dynamics of the reaction network.  These molecular fluctuations appear to have significant consequences; the observed large variation in rates of development, morphology and concentration of molecular species in a cell often lead to a randomization of phenotypic outcomes and non-genetic population heterogeneity.  Since these fluctuations may have profound effects on the physiology of the cell, stochastic models for the intra-cellular reaction networks and careful statistical analysis appear to be essential if the system is to be well understood.  The project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

Whereas previous work on random field geometry has concentrated on characteristics coming from differential topology, such as Lipshitz-Killing curvatures (which include the Euler characteristic) this project will concentrate on characteristics coming from algebraic topology, involving homology-invariant concepts such as the number of connected components, Betti numbers, and other related invariants. Furthermore, while previous work in these areas was in the setting of Riemannian manifolds, it is planned to extend this to allowing  non-Riemannian metrics even on smooth manifolds. In manifold learning this is important due to the fact that in some applications  natural measures of closeness underlying the context of a data set can well be non-Riemannian. In the context of random fields, it may open new doors in the study of purely non-Gaussian fields, such as stable fields, where the natural geometry on the parameter manifold induced by the field is  non-Riemannian.<br/><br/>The motivation for this project, which links algebraic topology, probability, and pure and applied statistics comes from both its intrinsic mathematical interest and from a wealth of applications, from areas as broadly spaced as the statistical analysis of fMRI brain images, high dimensional data analysis in computer science, and cosmological projects such as the COBE and WMAP experiments and the Sloan digital sky survey. The four PIs come from a variety  of intellectual backgrounds and are specialists with different, but complementary technical skills. Not only will this project join these skills, but over the next two years a number of other researchers will be added to the project, strengthening, among other aspects, its international component and extending to the training of young scientists in the US.<br/>"

Topics from genetics include regulatory sequence evolution, gene duplication, and the analysis of data generated by cancer genome projects. In finance, understanding bubbles in markets, swing options, and credit risk associated with subprime mortgages require sophisticated mathematical ideas from control theory, backward stochastic differential equations, and enlargement of filtration. The study of financial markets, insurance risk, and communication and computer networks lead to stochastic models that exhibit long range dependence and heavy tails. The analysis of these processes and the new phenomena they present, involves techniques much different from the classical theory of independent random variables, making use of ideas from a wide variety of sources including ergodic theory. In addition, there is a fertile interaction between probability and a variety of topics that arise from algebra, geometry, and analysis, including the use of analytic techniques to study convergence rates of Markov chains.<br/><br/>Probability theory, born in the analysis of gambling games, now plays an important role in biology, physics, economics, finance, insurance, communication networks, and in many topics within mathematics. The main aim of this proposal is to train more researchers in probability to tackle the many important problems that arise from its applications. Cornell is an ideal place for these activities because of the strong traditions of research in probability and interdisciplinary work in applied mathematics. Support for summer research projects will show undergraduates that probability is an interesting research area with many important applications. At the graduate level, increased fellowship support will enhance the training of our Ph.D. students. Postdoctoral positions will help new graduates expand their horizons, while hot topics conferences and annual summer schools will be a national resource for broadening the education of researchers (young and old). In all of these activities, the focus will be on developing theory to treat problems that arise from applications.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The well-posedness of a class of FBSDEs with jumps and possibly super-linear growth coefficients, as well as its application to a class of optimal investment/reinsurance problems with general insurance models will also be investigated. The PI also proposes to continue his research on stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance problems. Two particular problems: one involving the dynamic pricing of the ""Universal Variable Life"" insurance, and the other involving systems driven by normal martingales (or martingales satisfying structure equations) will receive strong attention. The latter is also considered as a theoretical extension of the proposed optimal reinsurance problem.<br/><br/>Almost all the proposed projects have strong background in applications, especially in stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance. Many of these problems reflect the new trend of securitisation of risks in insurance products and pension plans, and the results are expected to have broader impact on actuarial mathematics, financial mathematics, and could benefit the insurance community for good contract designs. The proposed project on the weak solutions for FBSDEs, especially the new notion of FBMP, will fill the gap in the theory, which has been left open so far.

Two proposed problems are more closely related to finance. The general convex risk measures will be put into the framework of the newly developed theory of filtration consistent nonlinear expectations, and will be investigated using quadratic backward stochastic differential equations and the BMO (Bounded Mean Oscillation) martingale theory. A credit risk model with partial information is proposed, aiming at a general framework where continuous observation, counting process observation, and delayed information can be present at the same time. New types of nonlinear filtering problems are expected to emerge, and some interesting new phenomena exhibited so far have raised new questions for the theory of stochastic differential equations.<br/><br/>The proposed research is seeking significant advancement in the field of stochastic differential equations, as well as the related areas such as finance. The proposed projects on stochastic viscosity solution for nonlinear SPDEs and weak solution of FBSDEs will build on the results initiated by the PI to further explore the nature of the respective subjects, and to fill the gaps in the long standing theory. The projects on variant reflected BSDE, on quadratic nonlinear expectations, and on credit risk models with partial information are aiming at developing new tools in stochastic analysis to solve complex but practical problems in finance.  Most projects in the proposed research have direct or indirect connections to applied fields, especially stochastic control, stochastic finance, and operations research. Two problems in finance theory will be treated directly, using advanced techniques in stochastic analysis and stochastic differential equations.

It proposes to build a systematic understanding of the slowing down or trapping of stochastic dynamics of disordered systems. The understanding is that for some of these systems the slowing down is due to localized regions in configuration space where the system spends most of its time. A general paradigm (the Trap Model) has been introduced in physics literature and studied recently by the PI and various collaborators. This project proposes to do three things: sharpen this understanding of this phenomenological model, show that it is relevant for mean-field Spin Glass dynamics (and aging) in a wide range of time scale (building on recent work of the PI and collaborators), and introduce the point of view of trap models in hard problems of Random Walks on percolation clusters. The PI will investigate the first topic and second topic with graduate students and an established international network of collaborators. The Co-PI will investigate one of the two themes of the third topic (Biased random walks on supercritical clusters) with the PI for the duration of his appointment at Courant Institute (approximately two years). The second topic will be investigated by the PI, the Co-PI and external collaborators. <br/><br/>Many branches of modern science are challenged with the complicated task of attaining a clear understanding of the time evolution of complex systems, or more specifically, of large systems comprised of many components and with complex local rules. In particular, the lessons learned in the last century in regards to the properties of statistical equilibrium seem of little value for most of these complex systems as they tend to be, under usual conditions, always very far from equilibrium and, in a sense, always in a transient regime. They achieve their equilibrium very slowly and exhibit fascinating properties along the way; one of them being ""aging"". These very slow evolutions are the subject of this proposal for addressing well chosen paradigms which are known to be complex and ""universal"", i.e. representative of a wide class of such phenomena."

The principal questions in ergodic theory are  existence, uniqueness and attraction properties of invariant measures for stochastic or deterministic dynamical systems. In the quenched random media setting, invariance is naturally replaced by skew-invariance and attraction has two natural counterparts, forward and pullback attraction. The main question is that of the existence of a global attracting skew-invariant positive solution for a cocycle generated by products of random linear cone-preserving operators. Therefore, one of the key points of the project is to develop a general analogue of the Perron--Frobenius theory for positive linear cocycles in noncompact settings. This approach will allow the asymptotic analysis for a wide class of infinite-dimensional stochastic systems and include the classical ergodic theory of Markov processes as a specific case. It is most promising in the situations where the random environment possesses certain localization properties. <br/>It is also aimed at the infinite-dimensional situations where the classical minorization conditions fail. Naturally, under this project several problems tightly related to the main topic will be studied: the problems of invariant measures for PDEs with random forcing and boundary conditions; localization issues for random directed polymers and associated parabolic models; universality classes for action-minimizing paths in random potential; the questions of regularity of transfer operators for  infinite-dimensional systems and related techniques of infinite-dimensional Malliavin calculus and non-adapted stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>Random media problems and ergodic theory have been intensively explored by mathematicians and physicists for many years.  In this project, these two fields are brought together. Ergodic theory studies statistical patterns arising in complex systems where it is hard or impossible to make exact predictions, and only probabilistic predictions make sense in the long run. There are many interesting and important practical situations including those from physics, biology and economy where the dynamics is determined by the randomness present in the environment which adds another layer of complication to the analysis. In particular, the statistical patterns themselves become random. The main and unifying goal of this project is to describe the random statistical patterns in the long-term behavior of these stochastic systems and understand qualitatively and quantitatively the mechanisms of their formation. The proposed activities include attracting students to this area of research beginning at the undergraduate level.<br/>"

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) Pinning and depinning of lattice polymers and interfaces due to potentials existing in lower-dimensional subspaces of the lattice. Particular emphasis will be placed on the disordered case, in which the potential varies randomly with location. Competition between a potential in a subspace and random potentials in the bulk will also be considered. (2) Layering transitions in the three-dimensional Ising model without an external field, caused solely by the attraction of an interface to a wall in competition with entropic repulsion. (3) Convergence to equilibrium, in systems modeling the phase separation that occurs in the freezing of solutions. (4) Moving interfaces, e.g. between phases of the Ising model, which may ""hang up"" at locations where a weakened interaction reduces the energetic cost of the interface, resulting in an energy barier which must be crossed.(5) Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the two-dimensional Potts model and their relation to decay rates of certain probabilities in the FK model. (6) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are opposed to each other.<br/><br/><br/>The research can help provide a theoretical underpinning for applied work in areas such as polymers, adhesion, and superconductivity. The work may lead to predictions which can be tested by experimentalists, leading to new practical discoveries.  Introducing a mathematician's perspective to theoretical problems that have previously been considered principally by physicists may in general alter the physicists' perspective,leading to further advances. US-French scientic partnership is enhanced by Alexander's collaboration with Francois Dunlop and Salvador Miracle-Sole.  This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors;(iv) denaturation of DNA; and (v) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small-scall randomness and macroscopic properties,including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. Some of the systems which Alexander will investigate-percolation, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems-are examples of such abstract systems. Other systems which Alexander will investigate are somewhat more closely based on specific physical systems, such as polymers, DNA molecules, and solutions."

Back in the sixties, in a series of pioneering papers Erdos and Renyi created what is now known as random graphs theory, a fast growing research area remarkable for fruitful interplay of enumerative combinatorics and modern probabilistic models and techniques. While Erdos-Renyi random graph process is based on assumption that a new edge location is chosen uniformly at random, it has been recognized that in some applications (internet networks) a more realistic assumption is of a bias toward more ""popular"" vertices (nodes), a so-called preferential attachment hypothesis. The proponent has proved that in this counterpart of the E-R process the random graph undergoes a rapid transformation, from a sea of small components (clusters) to a giant cluster in a sea of small clusters. The proponent plans to study the subsequent phases of the graph process, such as formation of a k-core, and the moment the graph first becomes connected. The proponent will study vertex and edge percolation processes on random graphs with a given degree distribution, and solvability of the random Boolean equations based on his previous studies of the E-R process at the critical stage. The program includes joint research with Alan Frieze (""mixing"" time of a random walk on an incipient giant component of the E-R graph), and Nick Wormald (directed version of the E-R process). Among other problems are (i) a detailed asymptotic study of the expected coalescing time for a ""m balls into n boxes"" combinatorial scheme, motivated by problems in population genetics (""most recent common ancestor"")and computer science (""coupling-from-the past"" algorithm by Propp and Wilson);(ii) enumerative-probabilistic study of ""sorting networks""; (iii) probabilistic study of ""hard-to-solve"" combinatorial problems, such as integer partitioning problem and a k-SAT problem, on satisfiability of a random Boolean function with clauses of length k > 2.<br/><br/>Importantly, besides its intrinsic mathematical value, the proposed research program is motivated by problems arising in related areas of operations research (two-sided labor markets), probabilistic modeling of growing information networks, percolation processes in statistical physics, and average case analysis of combinatorial algorithms. Some of these problems seem particularly suitable as research topics for the proponent's partnerships with PhD students.

Here one looks for (a) collective behavior of the system as a whole or (b)  a statistical description of the behavior that an individual component might exhibit.  It is emphasized that (a) and (b) are not disjoint criteria:  indeed quite often (but not always) they coincide. The setups that will be used to promote these studies are of four types; all,  to a greater or lesser extent, are interrelated and all four have their origins in the description of physical problems.  These are (i) [Classical Spin--Systems] Lattice models of spins or particles interacting under certain rules, primarily local, which are known as the laws of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics.  (ii) [Quantum Spin--Systems] A similar setup as in (i) but under the rules of quantum equilibrium statistical mechanics.  (iii) [Interacting Particle Systems] Models where individual particles or spins occupying lattice positions update their position or state dynamically in time according to stochastic rules that are themselves effected by the existing local configuration.  (iv) [Cluster Models/Graphical Representations] Graphical models where, in addition to local rules, configurations are determined, stochastically, according to global considerations or non-local rules.  In addition to the standard lattice based large-scale descriptions, some of the work will concern continuum models --as well as continuum limits of lattice models.<br/><br/>A philosophy which became prevalent beginning in the late 1960's is that of universality:  Once the basic nature and premise of the constituents and their interactions are determined, the resultant (possible modes of) large?scale, long?time collective behaviors in systems with many degrees of freedom do not depend on the meticulous details of the model.  Thus a variety of systems will be investigated where the nature of the interacting constituents is of the simplest type.  However, it is anticipated that the full tapestry of collective behavior will be exhibited. Thus, notwithstanding the physical origins of these types of models,  it is anticipated, at least by the PI, that these types of models allow for a broad range of applications--even beyond the physical sciences.  (Already some of this has come to fruition in the context of a related proposal which concerns the study of criminal behavior and allocation of police resources.) Moreover and perhaps more pertinently:  This proposal and its predecessor encompass a broad array of problems with multiple facets providing research opportunities at every level and the successful completion of the program will require the assistance of many collaborators ranging from the undergraduate to the senior research collaborator."

Varadhan<br/><br/>The main theme of the conference will be important recent results<br/>and outstanding problems in the fields of representation theory<br/>of finite and infinite dimensional Lie and super-Lie groups, and<br/>its applications to quantum computing, geometry, physics, and<br/>differential equations, the different areas being unified under<br/>the over-arching theme of symmetry manifested in geometric<br/>actions of groups and their representations. The speakers will be<br/>internationally recognized researchers in these fields and the<br/>audience is expected to be a mixture of senior researchers in<br/>these fields together with advanced graduate students, postdocs<br/>and junior faculty who aspire to make or already are making<br/>important contributions to these fields. There will be travel<br/>funds made available to select participants of the latter group<br/>with a special emphasis on women and underrepresented<br/>minorities. It should be pointed out that four of the twelve<br/>speakers are women. The background to the conference consists of<br/>the work on supersymmetry pioneered by the physicists such as<br/>Zumino, and Ferrara (both speakers at the conference), and the<br/>work of the mathematicians Kac, Moody, and others who brought<br/>focus to infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications<br/>to quantum field theory. In the 1990's the group theoretic point<br/>of view was applied successfully to the theory of meromorphic<br/>differential equations and their moduli. Very recently important<br/>new progress has been made by the development of a supersymmetric<br/>Mackey theory and its applications to super particle<br/>classification, by work on differential Galois group theory of<br/>difference equations, and by the work on the foundations of<br/>super-geometry.<br/><br/>Symmetry is one of the most fundamental and useful notions in<br/>both mathematics and theoretical physics. For example it explains<br/>the mysteries of the periodic table of chemical elements such as<br/>why hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. An example of<br/>symmetry is the following; consider an ordinary square made with<br/>wire, rotate it 90 degrees about its center and notice it comes<br/>back onto itself although the molecules of the wire have<br/>moved. Do it again, you still get the same square. When you do it<br/>the fourth time, i.e., you rotate it 360 degrees the molecules of<br/>the wire come back to where they started. In mathematical<br/>language this says that &#147;the cyclic group of order 4&#148; is<br/>the symmetry group of the square. It is a wonder that the notion<br/>of symmetry and group can be extended and enriched to explain<br/>complicated sub-atomic physical phenomena as well as solve<br/>fundamental problems in mathematics coming from areas such as<br/>cryptography. The symmetries to be considered in this conference<br/>are part of this same story. Of perhaps particular interest is<br/>the theoretical notion of supersymmetry used in the study of<br/>sub-particle physics. The founder of this notion, B. Zumino, will<br/>speak at this conference. It is presently a theoretical<br/>hypothesis that many believe to be true but which awaits<br/>experimental verification. It is one of the main goals at the<br/>European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva to use its<br/>multi-billion dollar Hadron Collider which comes on line in 2008<br/>to experimentally establish the supersymmetry hypothesis.

A new research direction is the utilization of three-dimensional mesoscopic modeling to understand growth of snow crystals. Computational and analytical methods are developed to connect the mesoscopic scale dynamics with the microscopic (particle) and macroscopic (continuum) versions. Finally, the investigator will devise combinatorial and probabilistic methods to understand the effects of random environments on growth processes in high-dimensional spaces important in genetics.<br/><br/>In a broad scientific context, the aim of this project is to understand principles by which various physical systems propagate disturbances. For example, crystal growth has been a subject of intense research for more than a century, yet growth of objects as familiar as snowflakes remains mysterious.<br/>The investigator's research sheds light on how microscopic description of a growth process effects the resulting shape, its space-covering ability, behavior at the expanding front, and stability to perturbations in the environment and in the dynamics. An important feature is the interplay between rigorous mathematical analysis and large--scale computer experimentation.<br/>This component aims to develop connections to physics, engineering and biology for fundamentals of crystal growth and other expansion processes, to computer science for efficient simulation and visualization algorithms, and to theoretical genetics for realistic insights into the structure of genotype and phenotype spaces. Together with the advancement of mathematical and computational methods, such research has potential applications to crystal manufacturing in material sciences, understanding snowfall in atmospheric sciences, and genetic diversity in biology. Finally, communication with general public by means of attractive computer graphics, and ample opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students' involvement in all aspects of such studies, will popularize mathematics and its applications.<br/>"

There are three directions in the proposed research: Wiener Chaos decomposition for linear and nonlinear equations, analysis of stochastic partial differential equations  in domains, and statistical inference  for stochastic partial differential equations. Wiener Chaos decomposition is a stochastic  analog of the classical Fourier method and is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic equations, from both analytical and numerical points of view. In particular, Wiener Chaos decomposition is the key component of several new numerical algorithms for nonlinear filtering  and the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in domains is necessary for  development of  a complete theory, similar to the one for deterministic partial differential equations. In addition to purely theoretical results about existence and uniqueness of solutions, this analysis leads to new  numerical methods for such equations. Methods of statistical inference make it possible to relate an abstract equation  to a concrete problem from applications. Unlike finite-dimensional systems, a consistent estimation in a stochastic partial differential equation is possible even when both the observation time and the amplitude of noise are fixed.<br/><br/>Stochastic partial differential equations  are both an interesting mathematical object and an effective  modelling tool in various branches of applied science, such as ecology,  finance, meteorology, and navigation.  Equations studied in this project can describe, for example, the term structure of interest rates, the propagation of an oil spill in the ocean, and the motion of the target on the radar screen. The research objectives of the project are to study mathematical properties of stochastic partial differential equations and to develop effective computational and statistical methods for relating an equation to  a model. The educational objective of the project is to increase  understanding of stochastic partial differential equations among the students and researchers both inside and outside of the mathematical community. This educational objective will be achieved by developing several basic and special topics graduate courses aimed at helping graduate students make a transition to independent research."

The investigator hopes to develop versions of  it which can be used to solve problems of interest to researchers in mathematical physics, spectral theory, and Markov chain theory. After completing works in progress related to Stein's method, the investigator will focus on four specific goals. The first goal is to use Stein's method to study determinantal point processes, which appear in random matrix theory, tiling problems, percolation, queuing theory, and elsewhere. The second goal is to continue the investigator's work on Stein's method and the spectrum of random walks, focusing on non-normal distributions, concentration inequalities, and convergence rates. The third goal is to use Stein's method to study error terms in Markov chain theory: central limit theorems and large deviations for Markov chains, hitting times, and the cutoff phenomenon. A fourth goal is to extend the scope of Stein's method to non-reversible settings.<br/><br/><br/>In making decisions of public policy, it is important that one draws correct conclusions from the data available. A drawback to many of the statistical methods applied today is that the accuracy of the conclusions is unclear. As one example, in determining whether there is gender bias in the promotion of employees, it is common to use a statistical test called the chi-squared test. As a second example, work on DNA sequences of interest to biotechnology and health uses Poisson approximations from probability theory. As a third example, in physics and chemistry one uses Markov chain methods to test theoretical models. These methods are routinely applied so it is important to quantify their validity. A remarkable technique, introduced by Charles Stein at Stanford, offers hope of better quantifying the accuracy of such procedures. Stein's method has proven successful in applications to DNA sequencing, but the technique is largely unexplored. The investigator plans to extend the scope and applicability of this method. As a final goal, the investigator will study the use of Stein's method in Markov chain theory, which as mentioned above, is crucial to drawing reliable conclusions from computer simulations. <br/>"

Only recently, however, have there arisen mathematical techniques for understanding simple interfaces of more than one dimension. The next simplest case,that of two dimensional interfaces in three space,is already quite difficult. The two-dimensional interfaces we study are called 'stepped surfaces'. Under the simplest choice of measure on these surfaces, the uniform measure for a fixed boundary, the large-scale shapes taken by these surfaces has begun to be worked out by the PI and Okounkov, using techniques from PDEs, analysis and tropical geometry. This model is essentially the only mathematically 'solved' model of random interfaces. Moreover it contains a great deal of mathematical connections with other areas: to random matrix theory, integrable systems, string theory and Gromov-Witten theory. For these reasons it is worth understanding this model better, and also worth looking for generalizations.<br/><br/>We are studying mathematical models of crystal surfaces. On an atomic scale, the surface of a crystal, such as a salt crystal or diamond, is rough and 'random', but at large scales it is typically smooth and facetted. How these large scale features arise from the microscopic interactions of the atoms comprising the crystal is, to a large extent, still mysterious. However we can make models of crystal surfaces which are computationally tractable in a mathematical sense, and display the same behavior as real crystals: in particular they display facetting and large-scale shape formation. By studying these models we hope to gain understanding not just of crystal surfaces but of the general phenomenon of how local interactions among a large number of constituents can develop into large-scale behavior."

Tools for specifying models and understanding the relationship between different formulations of a model are critical for model development and analysis.  The first part of this project focuses on the relationship between specifying a model as a solution of a stochastic equation and the more abstract approach of specifying the model as a solution of a martingale problem.  Each approach has its strengths providing different intuitive insight and different methods of analysis.  Verifying the equivalence of these two approaches assures the validity of methods drawn from each applied to the other.   Together, the two approaches provide powerful methodology for insuring that the models are uniquely determined and for deriving computational techniques and model simplifications.  The second part of the project will develop new methods of representing processes in terms of large aggregations of ?particles.?  These particle representations provide powerful tools for analyzing and approximating the associated models.  One goal of the project will be to make these tools more readily available to the nonexpert by providing more intuitive approaches to the construction of the representations and clearer identification of the building blocks used in the construction.   The third part of the proposal considers stochastic control problems with delay.  Controlled random systems arise in essentially every area of application as do systems with delayed response to control.   This part of the project is concerned with extending tools well understood in systems without delay to systems with delay.<br/><br/>Non-technical description.  The study of stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions of natural phenomena governed by ""random"" or ""chance"" mechanisms. Mathematical models of such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or both. The research to be performed is concerned with developing methods for specifying these mathematical models, approximating complex models by simpler ones, and constructing models addressing specific scientific applications.  The proposal addresses specific applications in biology and the theory and methodology to be developed have applications in other areas such as computer science and finance.  The project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  In particular, there is a high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of problems arising in all areas of biology."

Specific topics to be studied include exchangeable coalescent processes, random Gibbs partitions and fragmentations, coherent combinatorial structures, partial exchangeability, consistent systems of fragmentations, continuum tree limits, occupancy problems and power laws for random discrete distributions, and Bayesian inference. There has been a rich interplay of ideas between these subjects in the last few years, and it is expected that much more remains to be discovered as present models for the asymptotics of various combinatorial structures are challenged by problems arising in various application areas. One general theme is the rich variety of models of random discrete distributions which arise when unit of mass continuously distributed in the leaves of a continuum random tree is decomposed in various ways, such as by projection onto a branch of the tree, or by cutting with a Poisson point process of cuts along branches of the tree. Such constructions lead to models for random discrete distributions with natural interpretations in application contexts, for instance the Poisson cuts may represent mutations in a phylogenetic tree.<br/><br/>Results of the project should provide deeper understanding of models for the evolution of random partitions and partition-valued processes, particularly processes of fragmentation and coagulation. Such results should be of value in the numerous fields where such processes have been applied before, including physics, astronomy, genetics, phylogeny, ecology, and document analysis.  In particular, the application of random discrete distributions with power law tails to model the distribution of topics among scientific documents may provide improved methods for classification and navigation of large bodies of scientific literature."

Thus the goal is to show that such sums satisfy laws of large numbers, including moderate and large deviation principles, that the sums have asymptotically a normal distribution, and that the random point measures defined by these sums satisfy functional central limit theorems.  Yukich will employ a spatial dependence structure termed stabilization to establish general thermodynamic limits for functionals in geometric probability and to establish Gaussian limits for such functionals.   He will apply the general results to establish limit theory for particular problems in stochastic geometry, ballistic deposition models, random geometric networks and graphs, and spatial statistics.<br/><br/>Many real world problems involving the performance analysis of transportation and communication networks, extreme values, signal analysis, and even random packing of spheres can be understood as problems involving functionals of interacting particles, where particles interact locally but have long range dependencies.  In many cases the dependencies are weak enough so that sums of such functionals behave as though they were the sum of independent particles and therefore, when the number of particles is large, behave roughly as a sum of independent coin tosses, where each coin has its own probability of coming up heads.   This project aims to study the similarities between problems involving complex systems in telecommunications, statistical mechanics, and random networks and problems involving independent coin tosses. In the process Yukich, in collaboration with colleagues from the Lehigh engineering school and Bell labs, hopes to increase our understanding of problems arising in networks, random graphs, combinatorial optimization, and extreme values."
