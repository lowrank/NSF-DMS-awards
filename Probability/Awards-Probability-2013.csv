Levy processes are stochastic processes that evolve in continuous time on  a continuous state space. They include Poisson processes, Brownian motion, and any other process with independent and stationary increments.  Levy processes provide a useful class of processes with jumps for applications in many diverse fields of  science and engineering, as well as many useful models in mathematics and statistics.  This conference is held every other year, and brings together leading researchers in the field.  There is also a strong tradition of including students and beginning reserchers, includign a ""summer school"" that precedes the meeting.<br/><br/>This NSF travel grant will provide financial support for attendees, with preference given to students and beginnign researchers.  This technical conference brings togetherleading international researchers in random process modeling, including both deep theory and practical applications.  Important applications include finance, physics, climate, and water resources.  This series of  conferences has become a valuable resource for students and beginning researchers, exposing them to the latest advances, and providing useful networking opportunities.  There is also a ""summer school"" to prepare for the meeting, so that attendees can clearly understand the advanced topics.

In particular this proposal focuses on problems in the following areas: topology of random simplicial complexes, spectrum of random matrices, higher dimensional generalizations of percolation and subshifts of finite type.<br/><br/>Randomness is evident in many aspects of modern life from conflicting political polls to fluctuations in the stock market. Probability theory is the branch of mathematics which tries to quantify randomness. Over the last few decades the language, ideas and results from probability theory have been applied to many different branches of mathematics. This proposal seeks to continue this trend and extend the connections between probability theory and several branches of mathematics. This proposal also will apply probability theory to topology, a branch of mathematics which until recently has had little interaction with probability. The grant has will sponsor talks that will let undergraduates learn about the ways that mathematics has been applied to a variety of fields."

One of the main goals of this project is to expand our understanding of non-asymptotic properties of random matrices, in particular, their quantitative invertibility. A related goal is to develop a direct, nonspectral approach to delocalization of eigenvectors of random matrices. Methods of geometric functional analysis may succeed even where spectral methods fail due to an unknown (or nonexisting) limiting spectral distribution. Next, functional analytic and probabilistic methodology will be applied to high-dimensional data. This may result in new geometric approaches to compressed sensing, community detection in networks, and robust principal component analysis.<br/> <br/>Geometric functional analysis studies fundamental properties of high-dimensional structures. Such structures are ubiquitous in modern applications. The unprecedented volume of data described by large number of parameters prevents many traditional statistical approaches from working. This project will look for new ways to understand, represent, and analyze high-dimensional structures using methods of geometric functional analysis. Specific structures for which the new methodology can be applied include large matrices (e.g., consumer data), networks (e.g., food chains, social networks), signals (e.g., images, audio, video). Conversely, the fundamental challenges of high-dimensional data are likely to open up some new directions of basic research at the intersection of functional analysis, high-dimensional geometry, and probability."

The focal points of this proposal - smoothness, quasi-invariance, and Taylor isomorphisms - are fundamental principles in the study of measures in infinite dimensions. Although these concepts have their own intrinsic interest, one may motivate their study by physical applications. For example, in quantized classical mechanics, it is standard practice to perform integration over certain infinite-dimensional spaces with respect to ""infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure."" Of course, this measure does not exist, and the appropriate replacement is Wiener measure or, for an infinite-dimensional curved space, heat kernel measure. As the integral computations physicists perform routinely involve changes of variable and differentiation, quasi-invariance and more general smoothness results for heat kernel measures are critical in giving a mathematical foundation to these formal computations. Taylor isomorphism theorems are also significant to physical applications as they are related to the important problem of quantizing Yang-Mills fields which form a key part of the ""standard model"" of particle physics. The study of hypoelliptic heat kernel measures are important in the study of sub-Riemannian geometries that appear in physical models.<br/><br/>This is an integrated project of research and training in probability. The research program focuses on the study of so-called ?heat kernel measures? in infinite dimensions. Consider a curved surface (like the Earth) to which one applies a unit of heat at a fixed point and then steps away and allows the heat to propagate. The heat kernel measure describes the evolution of the proportion of heat in subsets of the surface at some later time. As the manner in which heat diffuses relies heavily on the geometric and topological properties of the relevant space, the heat kernel measure reflects these properties and analysis of this measure reveals much about the space on which it lives. Heat kernel measures are the natural generalization to curved spaces of Gaussian measures (higher dimensional analogues of the normal distribution) which have for many decades been recognized as the appropriate measures to conduct infinite-dimensional analysis. Infinite-dimensional spaces often show up in physical models; in particular, infinite-dimensional groups appear in quantum field theory and quantum mechanics. Thus, this research program contributes to solidifying a rigorous mathematical framework for the study of quantum physics. Many of the applications have finite-dimensional models which are accessible to undergraduates or beginning graduate students.  Thus, this project has a significant training component, including involving undergraduates in research on related problems in finite dimensions.  The training program also includes mentoring of graduate students in an introduction to math outreach and promoting the retention and visibility of women researchers in probability."

Specific topics to be studied include representation and characterization theorems of combinatorial Markov processes, continuum tree and interval graph scaling limits, consistent systems of partition, tree and graph-valued processes, and connections to random matrices and Levy processes.  The dominant theme of the research will be the effect of probabilistic symmetries, especially exchangeability, on the structural properties of evolving large combinatorial objects, as these structural properties impact various practical aspects of these processes.   <br/> <br/>As a result of this project, we should gain further understanding of models for time-varying discrete structures, especially partitions, trees and networks.  Such processes arise as natural models in various disciplines, including genetics, physics, biology, computer science and statistics.  In particular, understanding graph-valued processes has potentially far-reaching applications in the diverse and burgeoning field of complex networks.  Effective models for real-world networks are relevant to problems in national security, public health, sociology, computer science and physical sciences. Other areas in which combinatorial models can be useful include phylogenetics, machine learning, statistics and Bayesian inference."

One is the study of eigenvectors of sparse but large random graphs. Although such eigenvectors are of both theoretical and applied interest, very few results are rigorously known about them. The PI proposes to use techniques from Random Matrix Theory and combinatorics to continue his investigation of spectral properties of sparse random graphs. A particular goal will be to study the effect of cycles in the graph on the localization/ delocalization property of the eigenvectors. The other line of work is related to models used in mathematical finance. Particle system models from statistical physics have been recently successfully used to explain observed financial data and construct portfolios that can be thought of as arbitrage opportunities with respect to the market index. The PI proposes, on the one hand, to further study the properties of these processes as particle systems, and on the other, collaborate with industry groups to help them build more efficient portfolios.  <br/><br/>The mathematics we study has the following broader impact. Random graphs and networks are popular in diverse areas such as social networks, models for the internet, computer vision, and number theory. Several natural optimization problems on graphs (e.g., figuring out clusters, or ranking algorithms such as Google PageRank) involve what are called eigenvectors of the graph. If the network grows randomly, its eigenvectors are random, and it is of interest how they behave. The proposed work in finance is useful in building portfolios that gain from the presence of volatility in financial market. As such it is of great interest to practitioners who would like to harvest growth out of market fluctuations. The proposed research is a further study in an area which is already being applied by portfolio managers, some of whom are in consultation with the PI and his students."

Among the problems to be studied are the asymptotic behavior of branching diffusion processes,  transition between the averaging and homogenization regimes for transport by cellular flows, and asymptotics of solutions to nonlinear parabolic PDEs. Several problems concerning random perturbations of incompressible flows will also be studied.  These include the transport properties of the Benard convection, large deviations for randomly perturbed incompressible flows, and mathematical analysis of Brownian motors.<br/><br/>The proposed research will provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for several phenomena that have been actively discussed in natural sciences. In particular, we will consider branching diffusion processes, which are central in the study of evolution of various populations such as bacteria, cancer cells, carriers of a particular gene, etc., where each member of a population may die or produce offspring independently of the rest. We plan to describe the long-time behavior of the population in different regions of space when, in addition to branching, the members of the population move in space and the branching mechanism depends on the location. Other models to be considered describe the movement of particles (e.g., molecules) due to a combination of a macroscopic motion and a small random diffusion. In particular, we'll examine mechanisms that create directed motion out of fluctuations of a random or periodic velocity field even in situations when the field itself has no  preferred direction. Such mechanisms are very important in many applications and have been discussed in hundreds of physics and chemistry papers, although mostly at computational and experimental levels."

The main project in   this proposal is to study limiting distribution the spectrum of random matrices, at the finest scale, motivated by long standing problems from mathematical physics and probability.

Most mathematical analyses ignore spatial or network structure because its inclusion greatly complicates the analysis. However, as our past work with Simon Levin and others has shown, incorporating spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological competition. Our new work will focus on how spatial structure changes the impact of frequency dependent selection, and how the network structure of a social system changes the behavior of processes that occur in it. The models are idealized but the results give valuable insights about real systems."

The mathematical understanding of these models has considerably improved over the past ten years, based on analytic methods for invariant models, and probabilistic methods for models with underlying independence, including the analysis of Dyson's Brownian motion. This research project first concerns the local universality of such statistics, enlarging the class of models presenting the random matrices type of interactions; this includes the study of the so-called beta-ensembles, proving that the local interactions of the energy levels of many random Hamiltonian systems only depend on the their invariance type, and the analysis of universality for bidimensional spectra, appearing in non-Hermitian random matrix theory. Another part of this project concerns the mesoscopic scale in random matrix theory, deriving new statistics relevant in analytic number theory and random energy models.<br/><br/>Indeed, surprisingly random matrix theory overlaps fundamental problems in analytic number theory, statistical physics and statistics. Analogously to the Gaussian distribution, describing the fluctuations of many systems with underlying independence, random matrix theory statistics appear universally for many strongly correlated systems. This as confirmed by physical and numerical experiments concerning the energy levels of quantum systems, waiting times in public transports, the gap size distribution of parked cars, growing interfaces of liquid crystal turbulence, or typical and extreme spacings between zeros of L-functions. Random matrices are paradigms for statistics appearing in very distinct fields, and an increasingly important part of probability theory is devoted to understanding these connections."

Such systems originally were considered in statistical mechanics, however in recent years studies in many different fields have led to similar stochastic dynamical models. Some examples include, loss network models, default clustering in large portfolios, chemotactic response dynamics, and belief systems in social sciences. The basic mathematical object is the empirical measure of the trajectories of the collection of particles. There is extensive work on the law of large number behavior(LLN), central limit theory and large deviation results for this object. For example, under conditions, this measure under a large particle limit converges to a deterministic measure that is characterized through a nonlinear evolution equation known as the McKean-Vlasov equation. Most of the existing theory concerns the behavior of the system on a finite time horizon. In the proposed work the interest is in the long time behavior of the empirical measure process and its LLN limit. More precisely, the goal is to develop a systematic stability theory for the associated Mckean-Vlasov equation, and to study its consequences for the time asymptotic behavior of the interacting particle system. Three specific families of models will be studied: (A) Finite state Markovian systems arising from communication networks; (B) Models for active biological transport; (C) Opinion dynamics models.<br/> <br/>In many applications the time asymptotic behavior of an interacting particle system of the above form  is of central concern. For example, in communication systems stability and control is fundamental and one is interested in system design and control protocols that keep the state processes in the neighborhoods of desirable operating conditions over long periods of time. In applications coming from biological systems, one is primarily interested in describing aggregation, self organization and other pattern formations in the steady state of the system. In social science applications, such as opinion dynamics modeling, one of the key goals is to understand long term consensus formation mechanisms. All of these topics have in common the feature that they are related to the behavior of the large time limit of the associated empirical measure process, the study of which is the central goal of this research.  Research in (A) will lead to ideas for improved design, stability, and regulation of complex communication networks. Research in (B) will provide insight and understanding for diverse pattern formations observed in biological systems. Research in (C) will enable development of minimal intervention protocols that lead to desirable long term consensus patterns."

In addition, the P.I. proposes to use recently developed techniques in the theory of the expansion of filtrations to study questions concerning mathematical models of insider trading. It is hoped that such an analysis could be of benefit to regulators trying to ensure equitable financial markets, by showing how insider trading affects the calculation of the risk neutral measure of the insider, and renders it different (thereby affecting option prices) from the risk neutral measure of the traditionally informed market. <br/><br/>Mathematical models of the evolution of stock prices are widely used on ""Wall Street.""

(i) The study of the combinatorics, probability distributions and large deviations of 1+1 dimensional exactly solvable models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.  Outcomes of this research include rigorous verification of fluctuation exponents conjectured in the physics literature, new connections between combinatorics and models from probability and statistical physics, and better understanding of the integrable structures underlying exact solvability.   (ii)  The study of more general models of random paths and growing clusters  with probabilistic tools. This work will lead to variational descriptions of limiting free energies and limit shapes, and the identification of structures in these models that enable us to study their universal fluctuation properties. The grand goal is to establish some universal properties for models beyond the narrow set of explicitly solvable cases. <br/><br/>This project investigates mathematical models that describe complex interactions, growth,  and motion of particles in an irregular environment.   These mathematical systems incorporate randomness to model irregularity and unpredictability.  The goal is to discover general mathematical laws that govern such systems.    These systems appear quite different at microscopic and macroscopic  scales.  So it is important to understand how different rules for small-scale evolution lead to different large-scale systemwide behavior.  Real-world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion of vehicles,  packets in a communication network,  fluid particles in a tube, wetting transitions where fluid spreads in a porous medium, epidemics advancing in a population,  or the fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid.  Over the long term understanding complex interactions has profound implications for science and engineering and thereby for society. Models of the kind described in the proposal are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers."

This connection opens the door to a deeper understanding of the analytic structure of Tracy-Widom laws. It also presents a new method for investigating the universality question at the spectral edge for both random matrices and random Schroedinger.<br/>The second set of problems concerns bulk fluctuations for ensembles of matrices with no assumed symmetry.  Such questions are of growing interest in theoretical physics on account of the ties between these fluctuations and the Gaussian Free Field.  Finally, the investigator looks at several applications of RMT to wireless technology where probabilistic and analytic techniques from RMT are employed to estimate the capacity and performance of multiple-antenna communication systems with feedback.<br/><br/>Matrices and their spectra (eigenvalues) are fundamental objects throughout mathematics and its applications.  The study of random matrices (again, RMT) addresses the natural question: ""What do the eigenvalues of the typical matrix look like?""  Or, said another way: ""What properties of the spectra are universal in that they depend only on the rough characteristics (e.g. symmetries) of the matrix ensemble?"" It is therefore not surprising that RMT has serious impact in disparate areas of mathematics ranging from Statistics to Number Theory to Operator Algebras, as well as in Physics and Engineering.  On the theoretical front, this project brings new ideas to the study of the universal properties of the largest eigenvalues in symmetric matrices and also the bulk (or generic) eigenvalues in matrices without symmetry.  On the more directly applied side, this project looks at problems in the theory of wireless technology where, interestingly, the design and performance analysis of many efficient communication systems leads to mathematical problems cast in the language of RMT.  The engineering issues here are of the utmost practical importance - while the demand for wireless communications continues to grow, the spectrum remains a limited resource.  Presenting a natural setting for collaborations between mathematicians and electrical engineers, this project will sponsor joint meetings along with jointly mentored graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/>"

The main focus is on models related to Loewner's differential equation, and in particular on the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). Three principal directions of investigation are proposed. First, the PI intends to study almost sure fine properties of the SLE curves, primarily from the point of view of multifractal analysis. One of the main questions concerns the properties of the almost sure multifractal spectrum of harmonic measure on the boundary of the SLE hulls, but the PI will also investigate, e.g., the winding of the curve at the tip and the geometry of the SLE curve's collisions with the boundary of the domain where it is defined. All of these questions can be formulated in terms of the boundary behavior of the random conformal maps that generate the SLE curves. Secondly, the PI intends to study rigorous connections between the SLE processes and related discrete models and Conformal Field Theory (CFT). One goal is to develop the rigorous understanding of the objects and algebraic structures of CFT from probabilistic and analytic points of view. Finally, the PI will study the Hastings-Levitov family of models which uses iterated random conformal maps to model planar aggregation processes. A specific regularization will be studied with an understanding of scaling limits and the predicted phase transition as ultimate goals.<br/><br/>Discrete probabilistic lattice models are used in physics to model a range of phenomena, and they provide a source of many interesting mathematical problems. Techniques related to the random fractal Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curves, which approximate interfaces between phases in the models, have led to much progress in the mathematical understanding of such models in recent years. Within the project the PI will develop the understanding of the SLE curves' rich random geometric and multifractal structures. Beside the intrinsic and fundamental interest of these structures, and their strong connections with physical models, the universal nature of the SLE process suggests that methods and insights developed in the study of its geometric properties will be useful in the study of other random fractals. An important physics approach to lattice models uses Conformal Field Theories, CFTs, which (roughly) are ``smeared out'' continuum versions of the discrete models. The rigorous SLE machinery is still limited compared to the scope of the non-rigorous CFT predictions, and many connections between CFT and discrete models remain mysterious from a mathematical perspective. The PI intends to develop the rigorous understanding of the objects and structures of CFT from probabilistic and analytic points of view, in particular direct connections with SLE and the discrete models themselves. A related circle of questions concerns models of aggregation where planar clusters are grown to model important natural processes such as diffusion limited aggregation and flow of viscous fluid. Recent advances in the understanding of random growth models related to conformal maps has provided new tools which the PI will use to study versions of the so-called Hastings-Levitov family of aggregation models."

The proposal focuses on two aspects of this domain: <br/>(i) Analysis of the topological expansions. It was shown in the seventies that matrix integrals can be viewed as generating functions for the  enumeration of maps, that is connected graphs which are sorted by their genus, where the dimension plays the role of  genus parameter.   This is the so-called topological expansion. They were first used in physics as a clever way to enumerate maps. It then became an apparatus  to find invariants in many different fields. On a different point of view, the limit  of random matrices is well described by free probability.   Hence, free probability is useful to analyze  topological expansions and conversely topological expansions and random matrices can be used  to construct new concepts in free probability, with consequences in operator algebra. The first part of the proposal  addresses several  questions in this direction.   One of the  goals consists in   developing  a general mathematical scheme to obtain  topological expansions. Another one is to use random matrices and classical probability theory to develop the theory of optimal transport in free probability, hence proving isomorphisms results in operator algebra.<br/>(ii)The second part  of the proposal concerns the study of the universality classes of  random matrices. In fact, after the recent breakthroughs  exploring the universality class of  Gaussian matrices, it is natural to study matrices which are definitely out of this class.  The proposal offers to study heavy tailed matrices, and more precisely localization/delocalization of their eigenvectors as well as local fluctuations of the eigenvalues  in the bulk. <br/><br/>This research is in the area of  random matrices, which are  connected with many domains of mathematics and physics, for instance as a large (random) array of data, as the approximation of operators such as the Hamiltonian of large physical systems,   or more exotically  via the non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. The project focuses on its applications to operator algebra, combinatorics and physics."

The first sub-project is a continuation of the PI's ongoing investigation of the phenomenon of ""typically Gaussian marginals'' of a large class of high-dimensional probability distribution.  In the most recent part of this work, the PI found a sharp cut-off for the projection dimensions for which this phenomenon occurs for a very general class of distributions.  One direction of proposed future work is to enrich this theory by investigating the effect of additional geometric conditions on the measure on the largest dimension onto which most projections look Gaussian. A second sub-project deals with the spectral measures of certain types of random matrices, and has connections to both geometry, mathematical physics and number theory.  In very recent joint work with M. Meckes, the PI proved strong concentration results for the empirical spectral distributions of arbitrary powers of random unitary matrices.  It is likely that this work will enable a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the maximal eigenvalue gap of random matrices from the compact classical groups. A third proposed project is a collaboration with P. Albin to investigate conditions on a compact manifold under which the eigenfunctions of its Laplacian have approximately Gaussian value distributions in the high-eigenvalue limit.  Conjectures that such an approximation sometimes holds have mostly come out of quantum chaos, and some numerical evidence for these conjectures exists.  Combining earlier work of the PI with techniques of pseudo-differential calculus appears promising. Other projects in early stages include a collaboration with C. Hughes to find new patterns in the zeroes of L-functions, inspired by a deep result of Rains on random unitary matrices; a joint project with K. Kirkpatrick to prove central limit theorems in many-body quantum dynamics using a new non-commutative version of Stein's method; and a joint project with V. de Silva to extend the PI's earlier work on limit theorems for Betti numbers of random simplicial complexes to the context of persistence homology.<br/><br/><br/>A main goal running through these projects is to move away from the problems that classical probability theory has traditionally focused on, so as to interface with a wide variety of other areas of mathematics.  It seems that more and more fields, from Riemannian geometry to number theory to algorithm design and beyond, are finding that a probabilistic viewpoint can open doors to solutions to previously impenetrable problems, and suggest fruitful new lines of research that had not previously been considered. Central to such exploration is the role of independence.  Classical probability theory focuses on situations in which independence plays a key role --  when one can describe multiple experiments and assume that their outcomes cannot affect each other, very precise analyses can be carried out in tremendous detail.  However, probability arises in many fascinating and important ways in other areas of mathematics and science in which independence does not naturally occur, but where there is some other special structure.  Consider, for example, a sensor network that needs a certain degree of connectivity in order to function properly.  If sensors are dropped from an airplane over a region of wilderness, it is important to know how many are probably needed to gain enough connectivity for the network to function.  A classical probabilistic approach might be to assume that each pair of sensors communicates with some prescribed probability, independently, but a more realistic approach is to incorporate spacial data and say that sensors communicate if they are close enough together.  Understanding the likelihood that such a random network will function becomes a harder problem because of the lack of independence, but an ultimately more useful one.  The goal of this project is to investigate situations like this, in which independence assumptions are gone but geometric or other considerations can be exploited instead."

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability. Some of the topics in these courses will be related to the problems in this project. The PI will continue to write research papers, organize seminars, and give a wide range of talks, from research level to introductory one in order to encourage students into studying mathematics."

Firstly, in the area of random matrix theory, we seek to build upon recent progress in understanding the fascinating universality phenomenon for such matrices, by generalising the ensembles for which universality can be established, and looking for the underlying mechanisms causing this universality.  Secondly, in the area of arithmetic combinatorics, we seek to improve our theory of approximate groups and related structures in noncommutative settings, with potential impact on geometric group theory and finite group theory. <br/>Finally, we wish to extend and understand the exciting new connections between algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and incidence combinatorics which have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the latter subject by applying algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Physical systems are often incredibly complicated, being driven by interactions between countless components of those systems.  However, in many cases, a remarkable phenomenon known as universality occurs, in which the macroscopic statistics of the a wide variety of systems are governed by a single universal mathematical law, almost without any regard to how the components of these systems interact with each other at the microscopic level.  For instance, the famous central limit theorem in mathematics asserts that many statistics (e.g. the distribution of heights in a human population) are described by a single curve known as the ""bell curve"" or ""Gaussian distribution"".  While the central limit theorem is now very well understood, there are other universal laws that are still mysterious, such as the Dyson sine law that has been empirically found to govern such diverse statistics as nuclear scattering, arrival times of buses, and the spacing of the zeta function in number theory.  However, we have recently begun to understand this law for a simple class of models known as random matrix models, though even for these models there is still much work to be done.  We plan to work on further understanding the underlying causes of universality for random matrix models and related models, with the hope of shedding insight on the universality phenomenon for other models as well.<br/><br/>The second aspect of the research program concerns the phenomenon of expansion in various networks, most famously manifested by the ""six degrees of separation"" experiment of Milgram, that asserts that any two people in the world are linked by at most six degrees of acquaintance. <br/> For a mathematical model of this phenomenon known as a Cayley graph, the existence of expansion is closely tied to the absence of a certain type of mathematical object known as an approximate group.  There has been a substantial amount of progress in understanding what exactly approximate groups look like, but the control we have on these groups is still not as precise as we would like.  We plan to study the theory of approximate groups further, with an eye towards applications to other areas of mathematics such as understanding the geometry of groups.<br/><br/>Combinatorial incidence geometry is the study of how simple geometric objects such as lines, circles, and points can be arranged together in as efficient a configuration as possible for various purposes (e.g. to try to arrange a given number of points and lines so that as many points lie on as many lines as possible).  Understanding the limits of how efficiently one can design such configurations is a basic mathematical question which also has practical applications (e.g. in designing frequency configurations for cell phones in order to maximize capacity and minimize interference).  Recently, there has been several breakthroughs in the subject by introducing methods from algebra (particularly algebraic geometry and algebraic topology).  This unexpected development is still not well understood; the algebraic methods can solve some problems almost completely, while making no mark on other ostensibly similar problems.  We plan to study these methods further and understand exactly what their strengths and limitations are."
