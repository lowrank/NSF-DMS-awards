A basic objective is the study of stochastic partial differential equations driven by rough noises, which are more singular than the classical white noise. These equations provide random field models that play a fundamental role in a wide range of areas of applied mathematics and mathematical physics, such as growth models for interfaces, turbulence in fluid dynamics and polymer models. The proposed research will focus, among other topics,  on intermittency and chaotic properties of the solutions, which are related to observed characteristics  in  particular physical models.  A second objective of the proposal is  to broaden the range of  the applications of the stochastic calculus of variations, also called Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin calculus is a mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of variations from functions to stochastic processes. It has proved to be a powerful tool in deriving rates of convergence in central limit theorems.  In this direction, the proposal aims to establish new asymptotic  results in a variety of frameworks including numerical schemes for  fractional diffusions, where  the noise exhibits long-range dependence. Getting exact rates of convergence in this context is of great relevance in practical applications of these models.<br/><br/>A first working block of the proposal is the study of the stochastic heat and wave equations perturbed by  a  Gaussian noise which is white in time and it is a fractional Brownian motion in space with Hurst parameter less than 1/2.  The roughness of the noise creates new difficulties and important challenges in the analysis of these equations. We plan to develop an in-depth  study of such equations in a wide range of directions including existence and uniqueness of solutions, modulus of continuity in space and time, rough initial data, regularity of the density of the solution, moment estimates, sharp tail estimates, intermittency properties, chaotic  behavior and asymptotic analysis when the space or time parameters  are large.  A second working block deals with the applications of Malliavin calculus in  variety of open problems, including the smoothness of the joint density  for the solution to a general class of stochastic partial differential equations at a fixed number of spatial points, the analysis of the fractional Bessel processes and the eigenvalues of a matrix-valued fractional Brownian motion, and the computation of the p-variation of divergence integrals with respect to the fractional Brownian motion. The research will focus in the rough case where  the Hurst parameter is less than 1/2, and new challenging difficulties appear. A third working block of the proposal is to  establish new central limit theorems where the limit is a mixture of Gaussian laws and to obtain rates of convergence and asymptotic error distributions, using techniques of Malliavin calculus. Particular asymptotic problems to be investigated include approximation schemes for stochastic differential equations driven by a  fractional Brownian motion, weighted  q-variations of the fractional Brownian motion and limit theorems for intersection local times."

The focus of this project is the study of rare events, or extrema, that emerge in disordered systems. The vast number of agents and the disorder present in these complex systems make straightforward predictions impossible. The project goal is to develop tools of probability theory to improve our fundamental understanding of disordered systems and, ultimately, to lead to better statistical modeling of rare events, such as high volatility episodes in stock markets and certain kinds of phase transitions in physics.<br/><br/>Specifically, the aim of this project is to extend the theory of extreme values in probability to random systems with strong and complex correlation structure. The first objective is to derive fine asymptotics for the maxima of characteristic polynomials of random matrices and for the local maxima of the Riemann zeta function (which controls the distribution of prime numbers). These systems are examples of stochastic processes with logarithmically decaying correlations. The second part is a study of extrema of spin glasses, an important class of physical systems with more complex correlations that includes disordered magnets. The main objective there is to find a new approach to investigate the structure of the Gibbs states of the models. In addition, the nature and the existence of phase transitions for spin glasses in finite dimension (which are realistic models of disordered magnets) will be studied by extending methods based on fluctuations of relevant thermodynamic quantities."

Of particular interest is the scenario when the intrinsic driving forces within the physical system are highly irregular.  Such irregularities are prevalent in many mathematical models used in physics, fluid mechanics, epidemiology and financial mathematics.  The goal is to reach a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of such models.  In particular, the plan is to establish the existence of a large class of mathematical models in physics and biology which is sufficiently rich to allow for a broad range of applications and at the same time flexible enough to accommodate unavoidable statistical errors in estimating the parameters of the underlying models. <br/><br/>The proposed research consists of three major undertakings concerning stochastic dynamical systems:<br/>1.  Existence and spatial regularity of random invariant manifolds for singular stochastic differential equations (sdes) driven by Brownian motion and Borel measurable linearly bounded drift coefficients.   A Stable Manifold Theorem should hold for such singular sdes.  Given the extreme roughness of the driving vector fields, the existence and differentiability of the invariant manifolds would be striking and counter-intuitive.  The results will be attained via Malliavin calculus and multiplicative ergodic theory.  <br/>2.  A strategy for a proof of the Kupka-Smale Conjecture for stochastic differential equations driven by smooth vector fields on compact Riemannian manifolds.  The basic intuition behind such a fundamental result is that in order for a family of hyperbolic vector fields to represent the dynamics of viable physical/biological models, it is imperative that the family be ""rich"" within the set of all ""reasonable"" vector fields, and at the same time be insensitive to perturbations in the coefficients.  <br/>3.  Existence and smoothness of densities (with respect to Lebesgue measure) for the finite-dimensional random invariant subspaces of linear stochastic partial differential equations."

This year's conference, entitled, ""Stochastic filtering, Computations and Applications"" will focus on exciting developments of stochastic filtering and its computational implementations and applications. Stochastic filtering has experienced a rapid development in recent years due to its flexibility to engage modeling predictions based on pertinent dynamics with experimental data. Moreover, complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data lead to an urgent need for new theoretical establishments of filtering and novel computational implementations. The conference will feature, Dan Crisan, Tom Kurtz and Boris Rozovsky, who will each present three expository lectures within the realm of the thematic topic of the Lectures. Additionally, invited plenary talks by a dynamic group of international researchers at different stages of their career development and a poster session will take place. This project utilizes NSF funding to support travel and other participant costs for approximately 40 participants, giving high priority to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty members.<br/><br/>The 2015 Barrett Lectures will be the 45th installment of a highly regarded lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H. Barrett, head of our Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969. The Lectures are one of the longest-standing series of mathematical lectures in the country delivered by distinguished speakers. The focus of the 45th Lectures is the interdisciplinary impact of other mathematical methods into traditional topics of probability, and the increasing interdisciplinary penetration of complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data. A dynamic group of auspicious and prominent researchers will deliver talks and engage in discussions to deepen our understanding of the new stochastic filtering methodologies and theories which need to be further developed in order to meet the challenge of new complex scientific and engineering problems of the 21st century.

The questions raised spill over into other areas, such as classical asymptotic enumeration, algebraic topology, and probability proper. One major theme of the project is the effort to understand the ""threshold"" intensities at which various properties of interest appear in (large) discrete random systems. This is a classical area (going back to the beginnings, roughly 60 years ago, of studies of random graphs on the combinatorial side and percolation on the probabilistic); but it is also an area that has seen major progress in recent years, and one that enjoys close ties with several other disciplines, including statistical physics and the theory of computation. Though the questions under study are purely mathematical, work in this subject area has sometimes had quite unforeseen consequences, both in and beyond mathematics. This research project centers on simple and seemingly basic questions with ""pedigrees,"" that is, substantial histories of resisting solution. Attacking such questions is a way of forcing oneself to go beyond existing methods, which often leads to finding and exploiting new connections with other parts of mathematics and related areas. <br/><br/>Several of the main problems under study are concerned with understanding the extent to which various classical facts and theorems remain true in a random setting; for example: (a) When (i.e., for what p = p(n)) is the ""clique complex"" (whose simplices are the vertex sets of the cliques) of the random graph G(n,p) likely to have vanishing k-dimensional homology (e.g., over the integers or the integers mod 2)? (b) When does a random collection F of k-subets of an n-set X have the (""Erdos-Ko-Rado"") property that a largest subcollection not containing two disjoint sets consists of the members of F containing some fixed element of X? In these and other cases, further progress appears to depend on better understanding underlying issues of independent interest. The proposal also suggests some very general possibilities, for example, one on behavior of independent events as a guide to more complicated situations, and another (due to Kalai and the PI) which would in principle determine (up to an unavoidable logarithmic error factor) the threshold for a completely arbitrary increasing property (of subsets of some finite universe; the ""threshold"" being, roughly speaking, where the property goes from unlikely to likely). Though most of the headline problems are of probabilistic-combinatorial origin, there are substantial connections with other areas --- some combinatorial, others, particularly when it comes to methodology, more distant; for instance: (a) the proof of an old conjecture on presence of certain trees in a random graph eventually depended (very much inter alia) on developing precise estimates for a sampling-without-replacement version of classical renewal theory; (b) the currently most promising line of attack on the general threshold conjecture mentioned above is more Fourier-analytic than combinatorial and originates (though much has happened since) in work of the PI and coauthors nearly thirty years ago on a problem from theoretical computer science."

The aim is to describe the strange magnetic behaviors of certain alloys. Over the past decades, physicists' investigation has generated a series of methodologies and predictions. In the community of mathematics, spin glass models are purely probabilistic objects that present highly complex random structures. The general aim of this research project is to pursue mathematical investigation of physical phenomena including the complexity of the random Hamiltonian, the structure of the Gibbs measure and the thermodynamic limit of the free energy. As well as being important in the field of probability, the tools and results obtained in this research plan are relevant to a variety of scientific branches including computer science, theoretical biology and social networks. <br/><br/>More precisely, this proposal is concerned about the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. The PI will investigate the structure and the role of the functional order parameter in the low temperature regime. In addition, the conjectured ultrametricity of the Gibbs measure and the problem of chaos in temperature will be analyzed following the Guerra-Talagrand replica symmetry breaking bound. The PI will as well study the central limit theorem for some physical quantities such as the overlap and magnetization especially at the critical temperature using Stein's method. Another direction is the SK model with heavy tail disorder. As now higher order interactions are allowed, the system has been predicted to exhibit unusual spin glass phenomena. The last part of the project involves the bipartite version of the SK model, which was used to model collective properties of two interactive large groups of individuals motivated by the studies of the social and neural networks, biology and economics. The PI will be concentrated on the computation of the limiting free energy."

The main goal of this project is to obtain a better mathematical understanding of interacting particle systems and to relate them to other mathematical objects, including partial differential equations, random matrices, random polymers, random Young tableaux, and symmetric functions. Such detailed mathematical analysis would provide new information on the applicability of interacting particle systems as mathematical models within the fields described above, as well as on their limitations. In addition, with the mathematics of interacting particle systems being on the interface of probability theory, partial differential equations, and representation theory, the proposed research is expected to unveil connections between these areas of mathematics. Such connections are of great interest as they allow one to combine tools from all these different areas in future research.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI intends to study interacting particle systems with continuous state spaces in which the particle dynamics can be described by interacting Brownian (or, more generally, diffusive) motions. Typically, such systems are the continuous analogues of the more classical discrete interacting particle systems. However, the continuity of the state space allows one to apply methods of stochastic analysis to such systems and is natural due to the continuous nature of the (stochastic) partial differential equations describing the macroscopic behavior of interacting particle systems. In particular, the PI intends to study systems in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, which describes the microscopic dynamics behind the growth of random surfaces. Examples of such systems include, among others, the Brownian totally asymmetric simple exclusion process and the O'Connell-Yor semi-discrete polymer. In this context one is particularly interested in the asymptotic behavior of the leading particles and the spacings between them, and their investigation is a major part of the proposed research."

Queueing models are probabilistic models that capture the inherent randomness in a variety of modern networks, such as those that arise in customer service systems, computing and telecommunications, as well as transportation and hi-tech manufacturing.  The network structure is typically deterministic and the scheduling policy is usually specified.  Randomness results from exogenous arrival times, service times, and internal routing.  Feedback and non-head-of-the-line (HL) scheduling policies are common in such networks.  These local dynamics interact to produce aggregate behavior that is complex and often evades closed form analysis.  Hence, tractable approximations are needed.  The project involves specifying and validating various model approximations, analyzing their performance and/or optimal control and interpreting those results for the original system.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project concerns the study of three queueing models with distinct features presenting unique mathematical challenges as follows:<br/><br/>(1) to develop a diffusion approximation for networks of processor sharing queues, under general distributional assumptions in the presence of feedback;<br/><br/>(2) to employ nonstandard, distribution dependent scaling to obtain a diffusion approximation for shortest remaining processing time queues;<br/><br/>(3) to obtain asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for multiclass queues with abandonment under general distributional assumptions through the study of fluid control problems.<br/><br/>Each model has been analyzed in various forms that include some Markovian distributional assumptions (i.e., exponentially distributed interarrival, service, and/or abandonment times). Such assumptions aren't particularly realistic for modeling the behavior of modern applications.  Furthermore, the performance can be dramatically different for such systems in the presence of non-Markovian distributional assumptions. Therefore, system performance needs to be understood more fully. From a mathematical point of view, general distributional assumptions result in the need to track significantly more information in order to track the system state. For example, residual service times or residual abandonment times for each job in the system must be tracked in some form. This naturally leads to an infinite dimensional system where measure-valued state descriptors provide an effective tool for tracking the system state. In spite of employing this common modeling tool, the nature of the mathematical challenges are distinct for each model due to the distinct system dynamics. For processor sharing networks, a new strategy for analyzing the long time behavior of fluid model solutions will be developed. We anticipate that this methodology will translate to other systems where time-sharing is present. For shortest remaining processing time queues, nonstandard distribution dependent scaling is required to account for the order of magnitude difference between the queue length and workload processes in heavy traffic. Such behavior has not been observed for other scheduling policies. For the control of multiclass queues, new frameworks need to be developed to provide an analysis of the fluid control problem for generally distributed abandonment times. Such advances should further help in the analysis of a diffusion control problem."

The notion of universality plays a fundamental role: certain mathematical structures emerge from many different random systems when these systems are viewed on an appropriately large scale in space and time. We will develop the theory of randomly growing interfaces, where a one-dimensional surface is growing in a local fashion at random rates while also being subject to restoring forces such as surface tension.<br/><br/>In this context, the right notion of universality is specified by a stochastic partial differential equation, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. Its late-time and large-scale behavior models universal aspects of many randomly growing interfaces. The construction of line ensembles having a natural Gibbs resampling property whose lowest indexed curve is the fundamental solution of the KPZ equation is a technique developed in collaboration with Ivan Corwin that marries integrable systems approaches to probabilistic ideas. The proposal plans to exploit this new perspective to investigate several phenomena in models in the KPZ universality class, including aging and decorrelation in Brownian last passage percolation, and polymer coalescence and tree structure in the Airy sheet."

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more.

The purpose of the programme is to bring together leading researchers from around the world to explore and develop the burgeoning field of Random Geometry, a new discipline of mathematics that lies at the intersection of probability, geometry, and analysis. Random Geometry uses tools from these fields to quantifiably study the rich geometrical structure of random metric spaces and the random processes that live within them. Random Geometry is interdisciplinary in nature, and the intellectual merit of the programme lies in its potential to establish a cross-fertilization of ideas within different areas of mathematics and connect these ideas with theoretical physics and other fields of science. Broader impact will be realized via this exchange of ideas across disciplines and through the training of a new generation of students to carry on the work in this important field.<br/><br/>In addition to enabling long-term collaborations between leading researchers, the programme will allow for the dissemination of new results with conferences on Conformally Invariant Scaling Limits (Jan 26-30, 2015), Random Graphs and Trees and their Applications (Mar 16-20, 2015), Random Planar Structures (April 20-24, 2015), and the Geometry of Random Walks and SLE (June 15-19, 2015). The programme will begin with an Instructional Workshop for Younger Researchers (Jan 12-23, 2015). Funds from this proposal will enable the participation of United States based students and junior researchers in these programs. <br/><br/>Conference website: www.newton.ac.uk/event/rgm"

The meetings center on the topic of probability theory and have the goals of training junior mathematicians in the field and stimulating new research. Probability theory is a major branch of modern mathematics. It aims at a rigorous mathematical investigation of collective behavior of random phenomena and is one of the most applicable branches of science. The one-day workshop, to be held in February 2016, will feature four talks on the topic of nodal sets of random functions. The three day conference, to be held in May 2016, will feature twelve talks by experts on the topics of percolation, spin glasses, and random media, three central topics in probability.  The Summer School in Probability, to be held in July 2016,  will include five introductory mini-courses on various topics within geometric analysis, aimed at graduate students and recent PhD recipients. Award funds will be used primarily for the travel costs of attendees who are graduate students or postdoctoral scholars at US institutions. The organizing committee will seek broad and diverse participation in these activities, and will especially encourage the participation of women mathematicians and members of other under-represented groups. More information on these events, which are part of an Emphasis Year in Probability at Northwestern, can be found on the website: <br/><br/>http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/emphasis.html <br/><br/>In the last decades, probability theory has emerged as a central and core branch of mathematics. Part of its importance relies on the connection with several branches of science, including: mathematical physics, chemistry, statistics, economics, and other areas of mathematics. The programmed activities share and promote these connections. Percolation originated from the study of fluid flow on a porous media, spin glasses are disordered magnets that exhibit metastability and large complexity, while random media is a common background to study polymer models. The research on nodal sets of random functions goes back to the work of M. Kac on zeroes of random polynomials and share deep connections with semi-classical analysis and topology. These activities and topics present an excellent opportunity to bring graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to the forefront of research in probability theory."

The theme of this research is to see how predictions change when systems previously studied under the assumption that each individual interacts with all the others are made more realistic by incorporating space. The four main examples are the following: (i) the Staver-Levin forest model, which predicts that forest and savannah (grassland with isolated trees) are alternative stable states; (ii) evolutionary games, which have long been used in ecology to explain phenomena such as the persistence of altruistic behavior; (iii) Axelrod's model, which studies the spread of opinions when individuals interact with a probability based on the number of the number of opinions they share; (iv) the latent voter model, which studies the spread of technology in a social network when consumers who have just acquired a new product will wait some time before they are willing to purchase a new one. The general goal of studying these idealized models is to understand how properties of the equilibrium of the system depend on the details of the interactions. When each individual interacts with all the others, the system is an ordinary differential equation and is easily studied. However, when space is explicitly taken into account the problems become very difficult. <br/><br/>This project has the following specific goals: (i) show that in the Staver-Levin model, the direction of movement of a boundary between forest and savannah indicates the one state that is the true equilibrium in the spatial model; (ii) show that evolutionary games have three separate weak selection regimes that can lead to a PDE, ODE, or a regime in which Tarnita's formulas are valid; (ii) complete Junchi Li's thesis work studying Axelrod's model in the situation in which there are a large number of issues about which there are a large number of opinions (this would provide the first rigorous result for that model in two dimensions); (iv) show that even if latent period is brief, it changes the dynamics so that there is only one nontrivial stationary distribution, in contrast to the one parameter family in the voter model without latency."

The main questions concern first-passage percolation, independent percolation models at the critical threshold, and ground (zero-temperature) states of the Edwards-Anderson spin glass model. Viewed analytically, some of the projects seek to understand the structure and fluctuations of the maximum, or minimum, of a collection of correlated random variables; this applies not only to questions of geodesics and estimation of variance in first-passage percolation, but also to the organization of spin glass states. On the other hand the techniques have a geometric flavor, including tools from ergodic theory and Bernoulli percolation. It is expected that the results obtained will influence other mathematical areas, for instance polymer models, particle systems and questions in theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>The theory of random spatial systems  has grown to include models of random distances, fluid flow through porous media, random growth models and magnetic properties of dilute metallic alloys. The projects studied here center on such models and concern the connection between the small-scale rules that define the random environment and the large-scale properties of the system. While some of these properties are highly dependent on the nature of the local rules, others are ``universal'' and seem to only depend on the dimension of the ambient space. A main goal of this project is to understand the origin of this universal behavior. The results should have consequences not only for related mathematical areas, but for topics of current interest in physics, computer science, biology and financial mathematics."

The motivating problems touch fundamental questions such as the effect of initial conditions (e.g., ordered or disordered, random or fixed) in Markov chains on their time of convergence to equilibrium, and structure formation (surface shape, subgraphs in networks, etc.) versus disorder under various conditions. Many of the questions under study remain open, despite extensive studies offering detailed heuristics and corroborating experiments; the goal of this project is to make progress on these via new methods of analysis, which are expected to find further applications in probability theory as well as in other areas. <br/><br/>The first research project focuses on the interplay between a spin system, such as the Ising or Potts model, and a natural Markov chain modelling its evolution, for example Metropolis or heat-bath Glauber dynamics. The phase transition that both the dynamical and static models undergo has received much attention, yet various basic problems have so far been out of reach of rigorous analysis in all three (high, low, and critical) temperature regimes.  This project studies several such problems, as well as newer ones  suggested by recent advances, including understanding the effect of the initial configurations (random or deterministic, balanced or alternating, etc.) on the mixing time at high temperature and establishing a power-law for mixing at criticality in dimension 3 and higher.  A second research direction focuses on random surface models, as well as their evolution, with ramifications for the Ising model and the roughening transition in crystals. The final research topic addresses random walks on the Erdos-Renyi random graph: the project aims to study the effect of the initial state on the mixing time of random walks, and in different regimes to establish typical structural properties, such as robustness of its features to noise, and atypical ones, such as whether the system organizes to asymmetric structures when conditioned on an atypical event (large deviations)."

More specifically, the PI will study the scaling limits of such models, which capture macroscopic effects of microscopic structure.  The PI is interested in three important classes of models arising from statistical physics.  First, there are cluster growth models for corrosion of metals and crystal formation.  Second, there are models of electrical properties of randomly composited materials.  Third, there are models which lie in the intersection of the previous two categories, such as those for fluid flow in porous media.  Many unresolved questions surround these models and are now of great interest in probability theory.  The PI aims to resolve some of these questions by (1) using computer simulation to identify new phenomena and (2) applying tools from analysis, combinatorics, and probability to rigorously understand the new phenomena.<br/><br/>The models alluded to above share a common theme; each is a diffusion processes on the integer lattice whose scaling limit can be interpreted as the solution of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE).  The PI is primarily interested in three models: the Abelian sandpile, random walks in random environments, and first passage percolation.  The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena."

The current proposal focuses on those processes that arise naturally in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization. The common features of the proposed problems are simple formulation, fundamental mathematical structure, interesting underlying phenomena and non-trivial impacts on physical disciplines. One main aspect of the proposal is on extreme values for Gaussian processes. An example question is on the geometry of level sets for some spatial processes, and in particular whether one could walk on a random surface while staying on high mountains most of the time.  Another main aspect is on  phase transitions of random constraint satisfaction problems, and an example question is to decide whether there exists an assignment simultaneously satisfying a collection of random boolean formulae.  In addition, the PI intends to apply probability in related areas such as statistical learning and biological evolution. For example, the PI wishes to understand how features of individuals influence the structure of social network and what could be learned about individuals from the network structure.   Finally, the PI intends to provide research opportunities for both graduate students in probability theory, and to develop topic courses that bring probability techniques to students in related areas.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications on a number of stochastic processes in statistical physics and optimization. In the direction of Gaussian processes, the proposal focuses on a number of aspects including the geometry of level sets for two-dimensional Gaussian free fields, an improvement on majorizing measure theory, as well as the connection between Gaussian free fields and random walks.  For instance, we intend to study the random geometry and random motion on the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, which is connected to the Liouville quantum gravity.  In the direction of random CSPs and optimization problems, the proposal features the intriguing phase transitions of the solution spaces predicted by statistical physicists. Since most classical NP-complete problems are expressed as CSPs and random CSPs are a rich source of computationally hard CSPs, the proposed study of random CSPs are expected to shed light on underlying barriers to algorithmic performance. Some of the study of random combinatorial optimization problems is related to understanding the average complexity of certain widely-used algorithms.  Furthermore, the PI proposes to study certain probabilistic models for social network such as random geometric graphs,  as well as the NK-fitness model in biological evolution with the aim of providing mathematical explanation to some experimental findings."

This is an idealization of phase transitions such as the change of water from solid to liquid to gas as temperature varies. These mathematical models at critical values  of the parameter often produce random fractals.  The proposer will continue investigation of these fractals.  The theory is well developed in two dimensions where the systems are invariant under conformal transformation and the investigation will be on fine properties. The theory in three dimensions is less developed and  the main goal is to construct nontrivial models.<br/><br/>More specifically, the goal in two dimensions is to study the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) as a measure on curves parametrized with the natural fractal parametrization. Technical questions to study include the Holder continuity of the curves (under natural parametrization) and the stationary of the SLE loop measure. The latter property is needed to construct a conformally covariant measure on SLE loops analogous to the Brownian loop measure.  There are several questions in three dimensions that will be investigated: trying to show that there is a unique chronological loop-erasure of Brownian motion and to describe the limit as a Laplacian random walk; proving analyticity of the intersection exponent for Brownian motion and establishing the multifractal spectrum for harmonic measure; and finding general methods to give nontrivial measures on continuous, non-self-intersecting curves  of fractal dimension greater than one.

The general aim of this research project is to pursue mathematical investigation of physical phenomena including the complexity of the random Hamiltonian, the structure of the Gibbs measure and the thermodynamic limit of the free energy. As well as being important in the field of probability, the tools and results obtained in this research plan are relevant to a variety of scientific branches including computer science, theoretical biology and social networks. <br/><br/>More precisely, this proposal is concerned about the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model.

In addition, the conjectured ultrametricity of the Gibbs measure and the problem of chaos in temperature will be analyzed following the Guerra-Talagrand replica symmetry breaking bound. The PI will as well study the central limit theorem for some physical quantities such as the overlap and magnetization especially at the critical temperature using Stein's method. Another direction is the SK model with heavy tail disorder. As now higher order interactions are allowed, the system has been predicted to exhibit unusual spin glass phenomena. The last part of the project involves the bipartite version of the SK model, which was used to model collective properties of two interactive large groups of individuals motivated by the studies of the social and neural networks, biology and economics.

The modeling approach that divides the population into three groups (susceptibles, infected, and removed--the so-called SIR model) and its various generalizations has been used historically as an important tool in deciding whether epidemics grow or dissipate.  The investigators expand the traditional model of an SIR stochastic epidemic on a graph with a given degree distribution,  in order to account for the Ebola-specific features.  These include, among others, incorporating a class of individuals at high risk of infection (e.g., health workers), and incorporating a dynamic network structure that reflects how contacts with different segments of the population change over the course of infection within host.<br/><br/>The new mathematical model describing the way in which Ebola spreads through a network of human contacts, both in rural and urban areas as well as across countries and continents, will be informed by the actual  field data from   various parts of the world including Africa and the United States. It is expected that the model will allow  public health and government officials to quickly analyze a host of different  intervention scenarios  in order to  speed up the current epidemic's  dissipation and to select the most effective way of preventing, or at least minimizing, the future outbreaks."

Some of these models, such as percolation, have arisen separately in multiple contexts, such as fluid flow in porous media (which is relevant for example to modelling of pollutant dispersion in aquifers), polymer structure, and other parts of materials science. There are also connections to combinatorial optimization (as in the minimal spanning tree problem, which is a variant of the classical travelling salesman problem of designing optimal routings) and thus to various parts of theoretical computer science. This research project concerns the mathematical phenomena that occur in several representative examples of such stochastic systems with interesting spatial structure. One particular issue of study in the spanning tree problem is when an optimal route can go very far away from its starting and ending points -- a phenomenon known to experienced air travelers who want to optimize ticket price.<br/><br/>The work under this grant is in the general area of probability theory, with special emphasis on a number of stochastic models with interesting spatial structure. One specific topic is first-passage percolation based on d-dimensional Poisson point processes, with particular emphasis on nonexistence of doubly infinite geodesics. A second focus is on the classic problem of proving absence of an infinite cluster for intermediate dimensional critical Bernoulli percolation; a related problem concerns the number of trees in the minimal spanning forest and its dependence on spatial dimension. A third part of the project is to prove exponential decay of correlations in the recently constructed near-critical scaling limit of the two-dimensional Ising model. Finally, a fourth topic is the construction of scaling limits of voter model variants such as the q-state Potts model (in one space dimension) by using marked special space-time points of the Brownian web and net."

Many of such phenomena may be modeled by continuous time stochastic processes.  The first stochastic process that has been extensively studied is the celebrated Brownian motion, named in honor of the botanist Robert Brown, who observed and described in 1828 the random movement of particles suspended in a liquid or gas. The same  process was later used in 1900 by the mathematician Louis Bachelier to model stock prices on financial markets. Finally, in 1905,   Albert Einstein brought this process to the attention of physicists by presenting it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. The Brownian motion is an example of diffusion process. Like their ancestor the Brownian motion, diffusion processes appear in many different areas of sciences and economy and their  theoretical mathematical study has far reaching consequences in understanding and making predictions about the phenomena they model. In this  project, the PI will study several problems in  the theory of diffusion processes. In particular, questions about the deep interaction between the diffusion process and the geometry of the ambient space will be addressed and rates of convergence to equilibrium will be studied.<br/><br/>Mathematically speaking, the present project focuses on different aspects of the theory of diffusion processes and diffusion semigroups. The PI will investigate applications to sub-Riemannian geometry where diffusion methods turn out to be very fruitful to study generalized Ricci curvature lower bounds. The PI  will also address several questions about hypocoercive diffusions. Hypocoercivity is a concept recently introduced by Cedric Villani to obtain quantitative estimates for the convergence to equilibrium of some highly degenerate hypoelliptic semigroup. Hypocoercive estimates are in general very difficult to prove and the PI will systematically  study  new methods which parallel the Bakry-Emery approach to hypercontractivity.  Some problems in the rough paths theory of Terry Lyons will also be studied, in particular related to the properties of stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian processes. These projects will involve the training of graduate students and junior mathematicians. The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the blog of the PI."

Heavy tails appear when researchers need to model phenomena where extreme values appear relatively frequently, such as weather, seismology, finance, social networks,  and others. Long range dependence appears when the memory persists in the system for a long time. This happens in economics, hydrology, supply chain management, and other areas. Both heavy tails and long range dependence affect in a major way how the forces in a system interact and combine. Failure to account appropriately for the heavy tails and long range dependence can lead to very misleading conclusions about stability and reliability of the system - underestimating the risks in a financial network, or underestimating the bottlenecks in a communication network are only two examples. The interaction of forces in a system with heavy tails and long range dependence is the subject of the proposal. <br/><br/>This project deals with several interlinked important parts of probability theory.  The first one is that of long range dependence. This has been and remains an active area of research, into which this proposal introduces a number of new ideas. Further, limits theorems  of the central limit type, as well as related types, are bread and butter of probability theory, and the present proposal is likely to introduce an entire new class of such theorems and relate them to the notion of long range dependence. Next, interplay between the probability theory and ergodic theory is also classic, but the present proposal introduces new directions of such interplay, particularly with infinite ergodic theory. The expected results are, of course, results in probability, but some of the results can be of interest in ergodic theory itself. Finally, understanding the structure of non-Gaussian self-similar processes, particularly those with stationary increments, remains an important and difficult question, and the present project is likely to introduce new and unexpected families of such processes and, hence, allow a new point of view on self-similarity."

It is a fundamental problem to understand how simple, microscopic interaction rules produce intricate random features on a macroscopic scale, features that can be modeled by continuous stochastic structures. This general area of problems is relevant to many important physical phenomena, such as porosity and ferromagnetism. The project's emphasis is on the case of two-dimensional systems, where the last fifteen years have seen spectacular and ongoing progress, involving a wide variety of mathematical concepts and techniques, along with a rapprochement between mathematical and theoretical physics. The PI will continue to engage in mathematical and interdisciplinary training activities of students and junior researchers, in particular in relation with his research projects at the interface of Physics and Mathematics. <br/><br/>The program of research described in this project is mainly focused on two-dimensional critical models in statistical physics, with special emphasis on conformal invariance and the interplay between the field formulation and the geometric aspects of their scaling limits. The introduction of Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) has deeply influenced the study of conformally invariant random systems. This new class of stochastic continuous planar curves has proved extremely effective in describing the scaling limit of interfaces of critical models of statistical physics, such as percolation and the Ising model. The research projects of the PI have three main focuses. The first is the study of systems of SLE-type paths and loops, in particular in relation with the Conformal Field Theory formalism. The second concerns the dimer model and aspects of the free field description of its scaling limit, building on the analysis of families of Cauchy-Riemann operators. The third focus involves the exact relations between SLE paths and an ambient Gaussian field. The expectation of the PI is that these studies will help provide a deeper understanding of critical models and the interplay of the relevant concepts and tools in combinatorics, probability, analysis, complex geometry and representation theory."

These equations are partial differential equations involving a random component, known as the noise. They mathematically model dynamical systems in a wide spectrum of fields. Physics is the most important of these and was the origin of the use of SPDEs. These equations appear for instance in models for growth at interfaces (the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation), models for the movement of galaxies, and polymer models, and also in models of randomly forced propagation of waves, such as the movement of DNA in a fluid. SPDEs also appear in biology, for instance in predator-prey models and models for growth of bacterial populations. They are also a tool of importance in the modeling of interest rates in mathematical finance. This project focuses on study of the property of intermittency for solutions to SPDEs: the fact that the solution develops high-valued peaks (atypical of the average behavior) concentrated on small spatial regions. This phenomenon and its conjectured connection to turbulence and chaos has been very carefully described by physicists, who conjectured many results, only a very few of which are mathematically proved. This research project aims to obtain a more profound understanding of this phenomenon. This field being relatively young, some effort will also be invested into popularizing these ideas among the scientific community, in particular among students and future researchers. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on equations related to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation of physics, which is the central component of the KPZ universality class, a class of probabilistic models appearing in many instances of interface growth phenomena, such as percolation of a liquid in a porous medium, development of a population of bacteria, or the movement of cars in heavy traffic. In order to establish and understand the intermittency of solutions, several new techniques, such as stochastic Young inequalities, moment estimates, and scaling properties have been developed in recent years. These techniques have been successful in specific cases, but more general and more precise results are still sought. Knowledge of the quantitative behavior of the moments of the solution to the SPDE, as well as almost-sure behavior of this solution, are extremely important when it comes to careful study the peaking phenomenon, for instance the position, size, movement, and fractal dimension of the peaks. The project will develop new methods, such as the use of Galton-Watson type processes. The  main objective is to carefully understand the impact of the noise on the physical properties of the solution. Thus, the project aims to compare the impact of different types of noise (e.g., white, colored, fractional) on properties of the associated equations."

These mathematical objects describe configurations on lattices which evolve by a repeated update of a local rule. They have been utilized to model natural phenomena and have offered insights into fundamental organizational principles in many scientific fields, including physics, biology, computer science, and social sciences. From a more abstract perspective, cellular automata are a suitable tool used to characterize and catalog local dynamics which generate a prescribed global phenomenon. The first aim of this project is to develop and use techniques from modern probability theory, as well as computational tools, to study diverse aspects of cellular automata. Then second aim is to use the gathered insights to investigate more complex dynamics of diffusive, nonlocal and high-dimensional models inspired by crystal growth, genetics and social networks.<br/><br/>Three themes connect cellular automata with probability theory. The first issue, motivated by studying self-organization, involves evolution of a given rule from random initial states. The addressed topics include: nucleation, that is, random formation of centers that orchestrate a takeover of the available space; highly dependent percolation structures that determine the behavior of typical trajectories; and Lyapunov stability analysis through large deviations of branching random walks. The second direction are random rules, with a branching process approach to formation of stable periodic structures. The third, classical, theme is perturbation of deterministic updates by random noise. For more general models, the project aims to study non-local dynamics, focusing on nucleation theory, the nature of phase transitions, effects of space heterogeneity, and the boundary between short- and long-range interactions. Computation is a significant component of the research and involves simulations, analysis of algorithms, computer-aided proofs, numerical and statistical methods, and visualization techniques."

A point-of-view that has been particularly fruitful for understanding complex objects in many areas of mathematics, and science more generally, has been the formulation of an appropriate notion of distance between objects and the introduction of ""ideal"" infinite objects such that the finite objects get closer and closer to a target infinite object as they become larger.  The first subproject investigates situations in which an informative notion of distance is that objects are deemed to be close if they are close in a statistical sense; more specifically, the subproject considers various classes of structures where there is a well-defined notion of a randomly sampled substructure of a given size and one declares that two structures are close if the probabilistic behaviors of substructures of various sizes sampled from each of them are similar.  The goal of the subproject is to investigate whether there are ""ideal"" infinite structures in these settings and corresponding notions of random sampling such that the substructures sampled from large finite structures behave similarly to those sampled from a target infinite structure.  The second subproject investigates one of the senses in which large and complex objects may be broken down into simpler building blocks that are combined in a prescribed manner.  A prototypical instance of such a decomposition is the factorization of whole numbers as products of prime numbers.  Here the attention is on geometric objects which can be discretized to an arbitrary degree of precision by sampling points at random and the analogue of the multiplication of whole numbers is the formation of Cartesian products.<br/><br/>The latter half of the proposed research consists of two subprojects in the area of probability theory applied to biology.  One of these involves the analysis of metagenomic data in which the microbial diversity of an environment (e.g., the human gut) is surveyed by bulk sampling of genetic material from all organisms present and the subsequent placement of the organisms on a reference ""evolutionary family tree"" of microbial life.  The research will develop new methods for understanding the ways in which an array of such samples differ from each other and how these differences are affected by external factors such as the presence of certain medications.  The other subproject in the latter half deals with ecology and population dynamics.  It seeks to model the growth of geographically dispersing populations in an environment that is heterogeneous in space and time and shed light on questions about how environmental conditions, dispersal strategies and the effects of competition for resources interact to influence the long-term survival of the population."

Familiar examples of stochastic processes include stock market fluctuations, signals such as audio and video, medical data such as a patient's blood pressure or temperature, and random movement, such as random walk. A generalization, the random field, describes evolution in time and space. Examples of random fields include static images, random terrain (landscapes), waves, or composition variations of a heterogeneous material. This research project is concerned with a better understanding of the degree of dependence in a stochastic process or random field by using new techniques for studying the interactions between its variables. These techniques are based on surprising relationships with concepts that appear in other fields of mathematics, such as algebra and dynamical systems.  The results will lead to a more accurate prediction of future values of random evolution.<br/><br/>More specifically, in many situations, the interactions between the variables are viewed as a measure of the strength of dependence of a time series. The information about these interactions is given by a function called the ""spectral density function,"" which plays a central role in the theory of time series and random fields. Other spectral notions in mathematics are: ""operator spectral measure,"" which generates the transitions of a Markov process, and ""empirical spectral distribution"" of the eigenvalues of large random matrices with entries selected from random fields. This research project aims to establish several structural relationships that will build bridges between these three, apparently disparate notions, each having  the word ""spectral"" in its definition. The results of this research will show that this is not a coincidence. As a matter of fact, they are interconnected and they shed light on one another. These relationships will facilitate determination of the strength of dependence in a random evolution. They will extend and improve tools used for analyzing stationary stochastic processes and fields by indicating new ways to estimate their spectral density. Some of the results will contribute to a better understanding of the limiting empirical eigenvalue distribution for random matrices with correlated entries, exhibiting long range dependence. The research aims to show that this limiting distribution is uniquely determined by the field's spectral density and to find a formula relating them."
