There are many natural links between these two areas that  lead to a better appreciation of techniques and methods used in either field. In addition, an approach that combines stochastic modelling with a dynamical-systems analysis often has the best chances of tackling a problem successfully: three examples are nonlinear optics, where noise from various sources plays an important role in laser and fiber dynamics; stochastic networks, where stability of the network can, in many cases, be determined by the analysis of a related fluid limit that is characterized by an ordinary or partial differential equation; and cell physiology, where stochastic models of ion channel gates often provide better agreement with experiments. A similar trend occurs on the theoretical level: probabilistic methods are an important tool that aids in the analysis of PDEs, for instance in the derivation and validation of scaling laws and the dynamics of fronts in heterogeneous media; conversely, dynamical-systems methods provide insight into the behavior of PDEs with noise. The goal of this project is to broaden and enhance the scope and quality of the educational and research training provided to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows by integrating research and education in the fields of dynamics, stochastics, and their applications and to involve more undergraduate students in courses and research experiences in applied mathematics.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and stochastic processes are highly active and exciting fields of research that make important contributions to many applications in economics and the natural and social sciences, whilst also being of intrinsic mathematical interest. Dynamical-systems theory is concerned with time-dependent processes, while stochastics deals with nondeterministic, random processes. Examples where the interplay between these two fields is important are noise fluctuations in the design of high-power lasers, the long-time behavior of random interacting systems such as consensus formation in social networks, self-assembly of micro- and nanostructures for drug delivery, random fluctuations in biological cell processes, and importance sampling of rare events in finance. Providing more systematic and integrated training in dynamics and stochastics for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will prepare these groups better for careers in academia and industry. It will also lead to an increase in the number of US mathematicians trained in stochastic systems, and therefore make the US better able to compete with Europe, which has a larger community in this area. The initiatives for undergraduate students will increase the number of students who are exposed to applied mathematics and are engaged in summer research experiences."

The four workshops all fall under the general theme of relating the geometry of curved spaces to the differential equations that model problems in physics (such as fluids, heat, and gravitation). In the last 10-20 years, this relationship has been one of the most active research areas of mathematics, with Grigory Perelman's solution of the Poincare Conjecture being the most well-known instance. Generally the CRM (Centre de Recherches Mathematiques) hosts one or two of these themed programs per year, and they attract mathematicians from all over Canada, the United States, and the rest of the world.

Reflected Brownian motion with inert drift can be used as a mathematical model for some physical phenomena such as<br/>Archimedes' principle. Reflected Brownian motion with oblique reflection can be used to model queuing networks under heavy traffic and to solve partial differential equations with mixed boundary conditions. Brownian motion with darning arises naturally in the study of boundary theory of Markov processes. This class of diffusion processes  are an effective tool in the study of conformal mappings and Komatu-Loewner equations in multiply connected planar domains. The PI's will develop the mathematical theory of such systems and processes. New approach to invariance principle of random walks in distorted medium and stochastic homogenization in domains will be explored. Models of light reflected on rough surfaces and billard scattering will be investigated.   The PI's will study shy couplings and some Fleming-Viot-type models. Boundary Harnack principle for stable-like processes and sharp two-sided Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for rotationally symmetric Levy processes will be systematically investigated.<br/><br/>The PI's will disseminate the information on their advances in stochastic analysis in various ways. The existing very active Department of Mathematics probability seminar at the University of Washington attracts highly diverse audience - researchers in mathematics, statistics, applied mathematics, representatives from a research group at a private corporation, post-doctoral trainees and graduate students. There is a significant participation of women in the seminar, both as speakers and attendees. Once a year, the Northwest Probability Seminar, a one-day conference, brings together interested people from Oregon, British Columbia and Washington. Again, the participation of women in this annual event is significant. The PI's are strongly involved in the organization of the International Conference on Stochastic Analysis and its Applications, an annual event that  has been held regularly (almost every year) since 2006. It brings experts in stochastic analysis and related fields from all over the world to survey the field, exchange ideas and to foster future collaborations. Participation of young researchers and Ph.D students is significant. The University of Washington has established a Program in Computational Finance. Both PI's plan to participate in the program to help disseminate the knowledge of the stochastic analysis, including the most recent advances in the field, to non-mathematical audiences, with stress on students. In the past, the program attracted students from diverse departments, such as Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Finance, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Computer Science. The PI's have four doctoral students at the moment, including one woman and two non-white students. All doctoral students currently are or are expected to be actively involved in the research outlined in this proposal."

A first objective is to derive new central limit theorems applying techniques of Malliavin calculus in a variety of settings including additive functionals of the fractional Brownian motion, spacial moments of the Brownian local time increments, winding number of the complex fractional Brownian motion, and diffusion approximations in a space-time Gaussian velocity field. Rates of convergence of the Kolmogorov and related distances, and convergence of probability densities will be also investigated in these problems. A second objective of the project is to study stochastic partial differential equations driven by a Gaussian noise which is white in time and it has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion in the space variable. The existence and uniqueness of a solution, the regularity of its trajectories and its probability distribution, and Feynman-Kac formulas for the moments, are concrete goals of the project. The project also aims to establish the rate of convergence of Euler-type numerical approximation schemes for stochastic differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion using techniques of fractional calculus and variational properties of the fractional Brownian motion.<br/><br/>Stochastic analysis provides suitable mathematical tools to study ordinary and partial differential equations perturbed by a random noise, which are useful models in many areas of physics, telecommunications and economics. The application of these equations requires efficient numerical approximation schemes, and convenient estimates for the probability distribution of the solution. This project will make a significant progress in these topics by developing powerful mathematical techniques like the Malliavin calculus. On the other hand, the project will broaden the range of applications of Malliavin calculus, establishing new fundamental asymptotic results in probability and statistics. Motivated by applications in telecommunications and mathematical finance, the project will focus on input noises possessing long memory property such as the fractional Brownian motion."

The requirements for such bounds arise naturally in convex geometry and geometric functional analysis, where random matrices are used to study typical sections of a high-dimensional convex body. Another direction of this research is the geometry of non-symmetric convex bodies, where the probabilistic methods also play a crucial role.<br/><br/><br/>Several components of this mathematics research project are motivated by problems in computer science and engineering. These include signal reconstruction problems arising in computer tomography, as well as questions related to protecting privacy while releasing statistical information. Rudelson and his collaborators will establish new connections between probability and geometric functional analysis with the objective to study the spectral properties of random matrices.

Much of the existing theory of random matrices deals with normal matrices, which are stable under perturbations; many of the existing tools<br/>implicitly use either this stability, or some strong independence assumptions, even in deriving rough results. A major goal of the  present proposal is to build on previous work of the PI and collaborators and develop techniques that work even in a context where both structural assumptions (normality or independence) fail. While the proposal discusses and addresses some very specific questions, it is part of a larger attempt to develop new techniques that would be  applicable to a wide range of RMT questions. The second topic to be studied concerns random walks and branching processes in random environments. Though the theory of random walks is well developed, many gaps in understanding remain when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved  in the last few years by several researchers, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. The proposed project will built on previous work, by the PI and other researchers, with the goal of resolving some of these outstanding questions.<br/><br/>Matrices are the cornerstone of linear algebra, and are fundamental building blocks in operator theory. Random matrix theory (RMT) is concerned with the study of properties of random matrices, typically in the limit where the dimension of the matrix is large.<br/>Motivations and applications for this study come from several areas of mathematics (probability theory, number theory, representation theory), the physical sciences (especially, mathematical physics), statistics, and engineering (specifically, communication and information theories). In recent years, RMT has emerged as a major research area within mathematics, combining techniques from probability theory, operator algebras, complex analysis, and combinatorics.  Several major (and fundamental) open questions have recently been resolved, especially concerning the universality of limit laws regarding the spectrum of large random matrices. The proposed research will seek to significantly expand the theory toward a class of matrices whose spectrum is not stable under (small) perturbations. While the focus of the research is theoretical, an impact on applications is expected, e.g. in evaluating the stability  of complex systems, in computations related to quantum information theory, and in statistics. The second main focus of the study, random walks, are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such  RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and  reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place."

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability. Some of the topics in these courses will be related to the problems in this project. The PI will continue to write research papers, organize seminars, and give a wide range of talks, from research level to introductory one in order to encourage students into studying mathematics."

The particle positions represent fitnesses of individuals, the branching events represent births, and absorption at the origin models the death of unfit individuals.  The goal will be to provide sharp estimates for the probability that the process survives for a long time and for the position of the right-most particle.  The second part of the project involves studying a model of a population of fixed size in which individuals acquire beneficial mutations.  The goal will be to prove results concerning the speed of evolution, the distribution of the fitnesses of individuals in the population, and the genealogy of the population.

For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's Theorem says that whenever the two-element subsets of the set N of positive integers are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two element subsets are the same color.  Many years ago, the principal investigator proved that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition.  The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. Subsequently, other proofs were found that were less complicated.  But in 1975, F. Galvin and S. Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which makes it a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents.  Sets with the property that they contain all the finite sums from a sequence are called IP sets.  By virtue of the connection discovered above, a set is an IP set if and only if it has an idempotent in its closure in the Stone-Cech compactification of N. Those that have special idempotents which are called ""minimal"" in their closure are ""central"" sets.  These sets have much stronger properties, many of which are consequences of the Central Sets Theorem.  But central sets have a very complicated elementary description.  Sets which satisfy the conclusion of the Central Sets Theorem are called ""C-sets"", and are much easier to describe in an elementary fashion.  The proposed investigation of these various algebraically characterized large subsets of N should continue to yield new Ramsey-theoretic results.<br/> <br/>A significant portion of the funds in this grant will provide support for graduate students at Howard University, an historically black university.  In particular, the grant will provide stipends for three Ph.D. students, two of whom are black Americans, both female.

Typically the agents are located at the nodes of a network, either a homogeneous, heterogeneous or random graph, and transmission of ``information'' (infection, rumor, traits, etc.) between agents is random but obeys some simple local rule. Interest in processes of this type has been spurred in recent years by the introduction of ``small world'' random graphs used as models of the world wide web and the internet, and attempts to analyze large social networks. There is now a rapidly growing research literature on these new models, primarily outside of mathematics.  An example of the type of question considered in this literature is: given a particular network and interaction mechanism, will a rumor or trait spread rapidly throughout the network or will it quickly die out?  A second, related question is: will a given system relax into a quasi-equilibrium which maintains diversity for a very long time.  There are rigorous results available for such questions for some ``classic'' homogeneous lattice systems, but analyzing the newer more heterogeneous models raises significant mathematical challenges. The research in this project will identify key features of these models, i.e. features of the network and of the interaction mechanism, which will determine their long-term behavior, and develop rigorous mathematical methods to validate corresponding predictions. The project will provide a rigorous foundation from which further research can be based.<br/><br/>More generally, the project is concerned with how large stochastic systems based on local rules develop over time. Systems studied will vary from a spatial model for the evolution of genealogical traits in an infinite population located in homogeneous (geographic) space, both continuous and discrete, to a variety of stochastic models on heterogeneous random graphs.  The proposed research will develop rigorous mathematical methodologies for determining whether or not predictions made based on heuristic or meanfield arguments are valid. The research will make use of a range of mathematical techniques from branching processes, interacting particle systems, percolation theory, finite Markov chains, random walks, and random graphs. In particular the project will make use of, and further extend, results on the behavior of rapidly mixing finite Markov chains."

Recent study on this topic by the PI and his collaborators has led to solutions for a number of long-standing open problems including an approximation of cover times up to multiplicative constant posed by Aldous-Fill, the Winkler-Zukerman blanket time conjecture, the asymptotic relation between cover times and discrete Gaussian free fields for bounded degree graphs, the order of the variance for the maximum of the two-dimensional discrete Gaussian free field, and the critical behavior for Aldous' percolation of averages in the mean-field setting.

The main focus of the project is to understand extreme values of various processes via further exploring associated tree structures.

From a theoretical perspective, our study reveals conceptual connections among topics that have been studied separately, and further understand interesting aspects of important random processes such as random walks (arguably the most studied stochastic processes by mathematicians) and Gaussian free fields (an object that is of fundamental interest in statistical physics). From a practical perspective, the research is motivated by applications in areas including computer science, operation research and social network. For instances, the cover time of a random walk has applications in computer science such as testing graph connectivity and protocol testing; studying first passage percolation on social networks is of significance to understand the spread of information/epidemics, and in turn is likely to provide insight on optimal strategies to manage the flow of information or to preclude infections of diseases."

A key innovation is studying continuous problems, which normally use the difficult-to-work-with equations of fluid mechanics, by discrete approximations which allow tools from combinatorics, group theory, and topology to be used. An exciting new tool, the use of Hopf algebras, is proposed to unify the discrete methods. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are a basic tool of scientific computing used in physics, chemistry, statistics, and many industrial applications. The basic running time questions - How long should an algorithm be run to do its job?  are largely open research problems. The PI proposes attacks on two fronts. The first is spatial mixing of tracer particles in a two-dimensional grid under various stirring protocols: Baker's transformations, twist maps, and periodic figure eight stirring. Using tools from topology to bound stretching of line segments and tools from ergodic theory and  probability to bound the behavior of measures after stretching gives a program for analysis.  The second front uses new tools from algebraic combinatorics - combinatorial Hopf algebras  to  give explicit diagonalization of a host of non-reversible Markov chains. These include fragmentation processes studied by Kolmogorov, the riffle shuffling process, and many others. The first front is heavy on analysis, the second on algebra, but both fronts use analysis and algebra.<br/><br/>The work proposed builds bridges between different areas of mathematics and applications. The use of probabilistic analysis in fluid mixing and the  new discrete methods introduced to study continuous problems should contribute to both  probability and the kinematic study of practical mixing. The Hopf algebra front similarly interfaces probability and combinatorics in new ways. The PI is an internationally visible expert who will continue to give talks to both experts, outside scientists, and lay audiences about these exciting new developments. He currently gives about 50 outside talks per year. The  PI currently has eight graduate students working in these areas, as well as a comparable number of undergraduates doing senior theses. He has reached out to a much broader  audience: the book Magical Mathematics: The Mathematical Ideas That Animate Great Magic Tricks (with Ron Graham, Princeton University Press) has just appeared."

The goal of this proposal is to initiate a systematic study of how conditioning on observed data affects the properties of large-scale stochastic models such as interacting particle systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and Markov random fields.  Research will focus on developing the foundations of a conditional ergodic theory for infinite-dimensional Markov processes and of conditional infinite Gibbs measures; on the investigation of probabilistic phenomena such as conditional phase transitions; on developing connections with problems in measure theory, statistical mechanics, and high-dimensional probability; and on potential applications to the design and analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms for filtering and prediction in high-dimensional systems, where classical methods are known to fail.<br/><br/>Large-scale forecasting problems arise in a myriad of important applications such as weather forecasting, geophysical and oceanographic data assimilation, image analysis, traffic forecasting, and prediction in networks.

The broad goal of this project is to develop a systematic understanding of the interplay between complex models, randomness, and observed data that lies at the heart of any forecasting problem.  By focusing on the fundamental structures that are common to a diverse range of applications, mathematicians can provide unique insights and new directions to complex problems and provide an impetus for developing interdisciplinary connections.  At the same time, a strong workforce in the mathematical sciences is of crucial importance to the future of technological innovation and education.

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more. Educational impacts include providing summer research experiences for undergraduates and developing teaching/computational resources for interdisciplinary topics in statistics, probability, and mathematical finance. These activities involve graduate students and target the participation of underrepresented groups in sciences."

The questions proposed here are of value in establishing connections between the theory of Gibbs measures and theoretical computer science which attempts to understand efficiency of algorithms, including those which make use of randomness. Permutations are well studied objects in combinatorics and probability.

This research project first concerns the local universality of such statistics, enlarging the class of models presenting the random matrices type of interactions; this includes the study of the so-called beta-ensembles, proving that the local interactions of the energy levels of many random Hamiltonian systems only depend on the their invariance type, and the analysis of universality for bidimensional spectra, appearing in non-Hermitian random matrix theory. Another part of this project concerns the mesoscopic scale in random matrix theory, deriving new statistics relevant in analytic number theory and random energy models.<br/><br/>Indeed, surprisingly random matrix theory overlaps fundamental problems in analytic number theory, statistical physics and statistics. Analogously to the Gaussian distribution, describing the fluctuations of many systems with underlying independence, random matrix theory statistics appear universally for many strongly correlated systems. This as confirmed by physical and numerical experiments concerning the energy levels of quantum systems, waiting times in public transports, the gap size distribution of parked cars, growing interfaces of liquid crystal turbulence, or typical and extreme spacings between zeros of L-functions.

In particular, high-throughput sequencing is transforming the reconstruction of the Tree of Life, a fundamental problem in biology which provides insights into the study of evolution, adaptation, and speciation.  Through the development, implementation, and broad dissemination of new practical algorithms for phylogenomic studies based on mathematical analysis, this project will help advance the state of knowledge in evolutionary biology and contribute to the numerous benefits to society of phylogenetic research. Integration of research and education is a major component of this proposal.  In addition to providing training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, new undergraduate and graduate courses will be developed and research experiences for undergraduates will be an important part of the project."

It is known that if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then pricing the Black-Scholes type formula becomes delicate and difficult to analyze.  For instance, if the underlying asset price is a ""true"" martingale, then the European call price is a submartingale, hence the function is increasing. On the other hand, if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then the European call price is not in general increasing.  The project develops techniques from probability theory to build a bridge between mathematical models and financial markets.  A first main direction of the project uses the interpretation of the generalized Black-Scholes quantities in terms of last passage times in the framework of Bessel processes in order to derive fine properties of the call option process, as a function of maturity, written for the strict local Bessel martingales.  Concretely, the work aims to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding market bubbles.  A second main focus of the project investigates the enlargement filtration of the last passage time in the Black-Scholes type formula, in particular, its ""distance"" from the stopping time.  In a financial context, an example of the improper use of stopping time may be interpreted as using signals coming from available inside information. <br/>The project will develop mathematical theory and tools for detecting the presence of arbitrage trading in this setting which is also related to market bubble phenomena.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a series of market crashes and bubbles where mispricing takes place. In economic terms, a bubble is defined as a deviation between the price of an asset and its underlying values.<br/>Mathematically, bubbles are phenomena for which the discounted asset prices are strictly local martingale but not martingale under the risk-free measure. In other words, if the discounted asset price processes are strict local martingales, option prices no longer increase in maturity and Merton's no early exercise theorem does not hold. Intuitively, if a bubble exists, the asset price will increase initially, but a crash is<br/>likely to take place in the future.   It is well-known that many<br/>sophisticated financial derivatives have been built on the foundation of mathematical theories since the 1970s. As a consequence, such a rapid increase of derivative markets necessitates proper communication between financial analysts and mathematicians.  A general goal of the project is to develop a rigorous mathematical understanding of market bubbles and related phenomena.  The project is interdisciplinary in nature and will be integrated into practical applications.<br/><br/><br/>"

The relation between the zeros of the polynomial Q and the coefficients of P/Q have been demonstrated in a series of works from 2000 to 2011.  Via Cauchy's integral representation, estimating coefficients is reduced to residue integration along the zero set of Q.  There are two main open problems addressed in this proposal.  In the case where the zero set of Q is smooth, we consider the effective computation of the homology class of the chain of integration with respect to a basis of saddle point contours.  In the case where the zero set of Q is singular, only quadratic singularities have as yet been worked out; we consider here two examples of higher degree. The second part of the proposal concerns the relation between the zeros of Q and the coefficients of Q itself.  This work is part of the emerging field of stable function theory.  The main goal here is to extend the Borcea-Branden-Liggett theory of strong Rayleigh distributions to random variables taking more than two values.  A third part of this proposal concerns problems in discrete probability theory, including locating the critical points of a random polynomial or power series, and a problem on totally anisotropic percolation.<br/><br/>The broad impact of this research lies in computational infrastructure for computation in combinatorial applications.  Generating functions are used in many areas of pure and applied mathematics: random graph theory, theory of algorithms, statistical physics, discrete probability theory, population biology and genetics to name a few.  Estimating the coefficients of a generating function is a crucial step in any application of generating function techniques. This work, and particularly the part dealing with automated computation, allows users to compute without having to develop ad hoc methods in each case.  Broad impacts of the second and third parts of the proposal include further understanding of negative dependence among random variables.

Just as there are discrete ways to create random paths (by drawing them on grids) there are also discrete ways to produce random surfaces (by gluing together identical unit squares along their edges).  The PI will study both discrete and continuum random surfaces: their relationship to each other, their relationship to gauge theories and other aspects of theoretical physics, and their relationship to conformal random geometry and random curves such as the Schramm-Loewner evolution.<br/> <br/>In particular, the PI aims to show that, in some sense, if one builds a discrete random surface out of a large number of very small squares, it looks very much like the continuum random surfaces studied in Liouville quantum gravity.  Moreover, when additional statistical physical structure (Ising or Potts models) is associated with the discrete models, this structure corresponds to continuum random geometric objects (conformal loop ensemble) on the continuum random surfaces.

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability. Some of the topics in these courses will be related to the problems in this project. The PI will continue to write research papers, organize seminars, and give a wide range of talks, from research level to introductory one in order to encourage students into studying mathematics."

The questions proposed here are of value in establishing connections between the theory of Gibbs measures and theoretical computer science which attempts to understand efficiency of algorithms, including those which make use of randomness.

It is one of the simplest mathematical models which displays a phase transition as the temperature is varied. The Ising model has a long mathematical history and has inspired much of modern mathematical physics such as quantum field theory and string theory. Its integrability properties act in some sense orthogonally to its large-scale order properties. The integrability is nonetheless related to our ability to ""solve"" the model mathematically, so the connection between solvability and integrability is important to understand in this and other related models, which seem at present much harder to solve.<br/> <br/>Statistical mechanics is concerned with studying, through probabilistic methods, systems of many interacting particles. There is a tension between making realistic models, which are close to real-world phenomena, and making mathematically solvable models, which are typically more abstract. A new tool which we hope to use to increase the range of our solvable models is the notion of integrability. This is the notion, coming from dynamical systems, that in certain cases a complicated system can be shown to exhibit in fact quite simple behavior under an appropriate change of coordinates. We hope that understanding in a precise sense the integrability properties of the Ising model will lead us to see similar possibilities in other classical statistical mechanical models."

The new method will exploit blocking techniques to break the dependence and a new type of martingale construction based on blocks of variables.

Physical and mathematical systems accurately described in terms of Gaussian statistics are said to be in the Gaussian universality class. This class, however, is not all encompassing. For example, classical extreme value statistics or Poisson statistics better capture the randomness and severity of events ranging from natural disasters to emergency room visits. More recently, significant research efforts have been focused on understanding systems which are not well-described in terms of any of the classically developed statistics. The failure of these systems to conform to classical descriptions is generally due to a non-linear relationship between natural observables and underlying sources of random inputs and noise. A variety of models for complex systems such as growth processes, polymer chains, mass transport, traffic flow, queueing theory, driven gases, and turbulence have been actively studied for over forty years in mathematics, physics, material science, chemistry and biology. All of these systems fail to conform with classical Gaussian statistics, as has been observed through experimental evidence involving turbulent liquid crystals, crystal growth on a thin film, facet boundaries, bacteria colony growth, paper wetting, crack formation, and burning fronts. Surprisingly, despite their differences, all of the systems fall into a new statistical universality class whose properties are described in terms of a single model called the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation.

One of the most important objectives in any given model is to understand the asymptotic structure of its Gibbs measure and in a number of models this structure is expected to be described by a version of the Parisi ultrametric Ansatz.  For diluted models, such as diluted p-sat and p-spin models, the proposal concerns with a better mathematical understanding of a framework for the diluted Parisi ansatz described by a random measure on the space of measurable functions and, in particular, with finding new ways to utilize some recent stability results in these models. For perceptron type models, the proposal aims to develop new stability properties with applications to certain cavity computations. <br/><br/>Many models in the general area of Spin Glasses originate from the attempts to understand the behavior of various optimization problems from different branches of science (physics, computer science, biology) and, more specifically, their average or typical behavior rather than focusing on one fixed scenario. This is done by randomizing the parameters of the problem and then trying to answer several key questions using the methods from Statistical Physics and Probability Theory. In the seventies and eighties, the physicists developed a number of novel ideas to approach these very difficult questions, first, in the setting of the now famous Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and then later successfully applied these ideas to other models as well. The ideas of the physicists were for the most part heuristic and are often described by the German word ""Ansatz"" which means ""an educated guess that is verified later by its results"". In recent years, many of these ideas have been confirmed rigorously, especially, in the setting of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. The goal of this project is to build upon recent progress and try to confirm other, even more bold, predictions of the physicists that are crucial for broader applicability of their ideas."

(2) What kinds of computational tasks can be performed in a distributed system with no central control over timing? (3) What kinds of algebraic invariants can help distinguish between nonisomorphic graphs?  Abelian networks tie these three questions together: From a dynamical point of view, an abelian network is a cellular automaton that produces complex patterns using local rules. From a computational point of view, an abelian network yields the same output regardless of the timing of events at its individual nodes. And from an algebraic point of view, an abelian network associates an invariant, in the form of an abelian group or commutative algebra, to its underlying graph.<br/><br/>What can a network of computers reliably accomplish if each computer in the network runs at a different and unpredictable speed?  Answering this question would bring us closer to understanding complex networks like the brain, the economy and the internet. A related question asks what kinds of patterns can arise from simple interacting components in a situation where the order of interactions does not matter. A better understanding of pattern formation would aid in engineering desired large-scale outcomes by modifying only small-scale features of a system.  This kind of problem arises, for example, in designing a road network to minimize traffic delays and in using nanotechnology to engineer stronger materials."

One aspect involves studying dynamical processes on such systems, particularly the Glauber dynamics Markov chain. It will consider the question of universality of the cutoff phenomena at high temperatures as well pursuing a better understanding of the dynamics in the low temperature regime.  A second theme is the development of new tools for estimating the partition function of MRFs on locally tree-like graphs and inferring their local distributions. Understanding these distributions will enhance the understanding of links between phase transitions and transitions in the computational complexity of combinatorial counting, sampling and randomized optimization problems. The final topic of the proposal is to apply probabilistic theory and results for MRFs to widely used statistical estimators from phylogenetic reconstruction in computational biology and to develop new methods for detection of communities within social and other networks.<br/><br/><br/>Markov random fields (MRFs) are models of random processes on networks which play a major role in a wide range of areas including mathematical physics, machine learning and statistics, theoretical computer science and computational evolutionary biology.  This proposal seeks to develop new theory for MRFs to better understand models, algorithms and estimators and other probabilistic techniques in these areas.  It considers the problem of how much data is needed for standard statistical procedures, such as maximum likelihood estimation, to recover the underlying evolutionary tree for a collection of species.  The proposal addresses questions from computer science about when combinatorial counting problems, such as counting the number of independent sets in a graph, become computationally intractable and how is it related to the transitions of MRFs on trees.   It also studies questions of how long it takes random processes on networks, such as the Glauber dynamics Markov chain, to reach their equilibrium distribution and how does this depend on the local interactions of the model.    Each of these questions is related to probabilistic properties of MRFs and their transitions between different phases.  The proposal focuses on development of mathematical theory with a view to better understanding these problems."

The ongoing Workshop in  Analysis and Probability at Texas A&M University brings together senior and junior  researchers and graduate students in several areas of analysis and probability as well as  researchers in other fields (such as geometry and theoretical computer science) in order to broaden the education of the younger participants and to promote interaction among researchers in various fields.  The Workshop also sponsors  three day  conferences (SUMIRFAS-Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar), Concentration Weeks, and mini-conferences.  These conferences include introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non experts with the basics of an area as well as advanced lectures for experts.<br/><br/>The Workshop activities have a wide impact by providing intellectual stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of junior participants to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge and to interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also significant outreach to  applied mathematics and  computer science. Indeed, a very important aspect of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from experts in two or more research areas."
