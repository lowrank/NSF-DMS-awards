It is a very active field, since many questions in other fields can be represented mathematically as matrix problems. For example: the spectra of heavy atoms in physics, statistical estimation of covariance matrices in statistics, capacity of quantum channels in quantum communication, conducting properties of semiconductors (Anderson models). This project aims to study the basic properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar (conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate students who have an interest in probability theory. The investigator will also run workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to random matrix theory as well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.  <br/><br/>The investigator will focus on the identification of the eigenvalue densities, the local eigenvalue statistics and the  eigenvector distributions of  many different classes of random matrix ensembles. The ensembles considered in this project include anisotropic  matrices, band matrices, i.i.d. random matrices, and general non-Hermitian matrices. One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied. The investigator will apply some new ideas on these type of matrices. In this proposal, some projects are also designed for training graduate and undergraduate students, which include proving the universality phenomenon for more general random matrix ensembles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data science has experienced rapid recent development, largely in response to the challenges associated with massive data sets. The enhanced ability to collect and store data requires a fundamental change in approaches to data analysis. Today's big data challenge presents a unique opportunity to discover new scalable approaches and to expand current theoretical and computational algorithms. The conference features keynote lectures by Andrea Bertozzi and Aad van der Vaart. Additionally, a dynamic group of U.S. and international researchers at different career stages will give invited plenary talks and poster presentations. This project utilizes NSF funding to support travel and other participation costs for approximately forty researchers, giving priority to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty members. <br/><br/>The 2017 Barrett Lectures will be the 47th installment of a lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H. Barrett, head of the Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969. The Lectures are one of the longest-running mathematical lecture series in the country and are delivered by distinguished speakers. The focus of the 47th Lectures is the application of several mathematical methods in topics of data analysis and the growing penetration of complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data. A dynamic group of prominent researchers will expose several research avenues for integrating aspects of our respective (but seemingly disparate) big data perspectives. These connections will ultimately deepen our understanding of the emerging methodologies, which are vital for solving the scientific and engineering problems of the 21st century. Young researchers, especially, will benefit from exposure to the wide array of approaches presented at the meeting.

This is the case for a large class of systems in condensed matter physics, data science, finance, computer science, and pure mathematics. The behavior of such complex systems depends crucially on rare events, or extrema, that may have a large impact on their dynamics. This project is a rigorous study of the fundamental patterns that arise in a wide range of complex systems exhibiting many different extrema. The aim is to develop general quantitative methods to understand the statistics of extrema of these systems and to draw new connections with related problems in mathematics and physics. It also involves the advanced training of students in the applications of probability in data science, finance, and computer science in partnership with practitioners in academia and in industry. <br/><br/>More precisely, complex systems can be viewed as stochastic processes with strongly correlated random variables. The statistics of extrema of such processes are still poorly understood from a rigorous point of view. Important examples include disordered systems in statistical mechanics (e.g., spin glasses), which are closely related to optimization problems in computer and data sciences. The focus of the project is on developing new probability methods in two instances: realistic spin glasses in statistical mechanics and the Riemann zeta function in number theory. In particular, it builds on recent progress in the description of infinite-dimensional models of spin glasses to propose a new rigorous method to investigate the behavior of realistic (finite-dimensional) spin glasses, which exhibit unusual magnetic behavior due to the presence of many extremal energies. The program also outlines new directions of research in pure mathematics by studying the Riemann zeta function as a disordered system. The objectives are to develop methods of statistical mechanics to study the extreme values of the Riemann zeta function in a short interval of the critical strip, and to explore the implications in number theory."

The goal of this project is to analyze such complex systems where the interactions have high-dimensional dependence structures and where the extremes (network hubs, low energy configurations, optimal trajectories) play a significant role. As well as being important to probability theory, the results to be obtained in this project will be relevant and applied to many branches of science, as most of the questions were introduced to understand the behavior of various optimization problems in physics, computer science, theoretical biology, and social networks. The project includes summer programs in probability aimed at US undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The project involves problems on mean field spin glass models and on first-passage percolation in the d-dimensional integer lattice. The PI plans to investigate the structure of the Parisi measure in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model at low temperature, the phenomena of full replica symmetry breaking, and extensions of the Parisi theory to other disordered complex systems. The PI also plans to develop an intrinsic theory of geodesic rays in first passage percolation and its relation to fluctuations predictions (in two-dimensions given by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang theory), outside the scope of integrable models. As part of the educational component of the project, the PI will continue his mentorship and training of students and post-doctoral fellows. The project includes probability summer programs (schools and boot-camps) aimed at US undergraduate and graduate students."

The Midwest Probability Colloquium (MPC) is an annual conference series on probability theory and related topics held every year during the second weekend (Thursday to Saturday) of October at Northwestern University. It has been financially supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation for the past 38 years. Northwestern University is the other major sponsor by providing the meeting venue and staff support. Each year October is the time just before the hiring season for mathematics Ph.D's and postdoctors gets earnestly under way. For this reason the conference has always been eagerly anticipated by graduate students and young researchers all over the country. It provides them with a great opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians and to broaden their employment prospects. Among the conferences of similar nature, the MPC stands out for its unique format in dividing its program into tutorial and research programs. The speakers of these programs are selected by a scientific committee elected at the previous year's conference. They are chosen not only for their outstanding research records but also for their excellent lecturing style. <br/><br/>Probability theory is a major branch of modern mathematics. It aims at a rigorous mathematical investigation of collective behavior of random phenomena and is one of the most applicable branches of mathematics. Mathematical models established with the aid of probability theory have been successfully applied in diverse areas such as applied physics, biological science, and finance. Probabilistic models can be roughly classified into two major classes: continuous and discrete. The most important representative of the first class is Brownian motion and general diffusion processes. The second class includes random walks and percolation models. Besides its wide applications in applied sciences and social sciences, the last few decades have also seen probabilistic methods making its sometime unexpected way into other branches of pure mathematics such as differential geometry, number theory, partial differential equations, mathematical physics. The common underlying theme for such applications is that probability theory puts a measure on a space (often a function space or a configuration space) much larger than original problems dictate, thus providing much richer structures and selections of tools to solve original problems. Mathematicians working in probability and related fields are scattered around the country in universities. It is very important for them to have a regular forum at which they can exchange ideas and results and keep informed with the latest development in their respective special areas and to broaden their research prospects. The annual Midwest Probability Colloquium provides such a forum and is one of the most successful and longest running annual meetings of probabilists around the country. <br/><br/>The conference website is at http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/mwp/"

A perfect example of the field's reach is offered by the so-called Tracy-Widom laws. First discovered in the description of the largest eigenvalues for certain large random matrices, these laws are now understood to serve the role of the ""bell curve"" (or provide the appropriate central limit theorem) for a wide area of modern nonlinear phenomena. The main objective of this research is to advance our understanding of these and other probability laws introduced through the study of random matrices. The focus is on their basic mathematical properties, as well as extending the class of models in which they apply.<br/><br/>The research builds in part on the PI's recent work on the general beta extensions of the Tracy-Widom and related distributions. These extensions have the advantage of embedding the more familiar triple(s) of limit laws (tied to the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry classes) into a one-parameter family of distributions defined via random differential operators. The main goal here is to push this approach toward descriptions of more exotic limit theorems, such as the higher order Tracy-Widom laws and various double scaling regimes (again in the general beta context). Additional projects center around a recently established matrix version of the classical Dufresne identity for integrated geometric Brownian motion as well as solvable matrix models which interpolate between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Symplectic Ensembles and can be viewed as multi-type coulomb gases."

(1) ""How can we design an election so that the outcome does not change due to miscounted or corrupted votes?"" (2) ""What is the best way to cluster data on a computer?"" (3) ""How can we understand the geometry of networks?""  Questions (1) and (2) can be reformulated as isoperimetric problems.  One example of an isoperimetric problem asks for the shape of a fence of fixed length that encloses the most area (the answer being a circular fence, which was known since ancient times).  The specific isoperimetric problems the principal investigator studies can be phrased as probabilistic problems, and this project develops some new tools from calculus to deal with these problems.  Different versions of Question (1) have been studied extensively by game theorists in the 1950s and 1960s, but investigations in theoretical computer science in the last two decades have given renewed interest for Questions (1), (2), and (3).  Generally speaking, theoretical computer science finds ways for computers to solve problems as quickly and as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>This project develops two analytic tools in probability: the calculus of variations and curvature.  Several recent isoperimetric problems in probability and theoretical computer science such as (1) and (2) ask for the Euclidean sets of smallest Gaussian perimeter and fixed Gaussian volume.  A breakthrough result of Choksi and Sternberg from 2007 allows the calculus of variations to be applied to these optimization problems, though others have not yet used variational tools for these problems.  The principal investigator will also develop theories of curvature for hypercontractive and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.  For a Riemannian manifold, Ricci curvature bounds imply logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, a result of Bakry and Emery from 1985.  In this project, different notions of Ricci curvature on random graphs will be investigated. Theories of Ricci curvature for noncommutative logarithmic Sobolev inequalities will also be investigated."

They bring together a diverse group of accomplished and early career researchers in probability and stochastic processes.  The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research in the theory of stochastic processes, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal atmosphere.<br/><br/>Stochastic processes are basic building blocks of the way that randomness exhibits itself in the real world, and are used to model a wide range of physical, biological, ecological, and financial phenomena. The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many prominent probabilists attend every year. The format of this meeting is based on the success of recent Seminars on Stochastic Processes. There will be five one hour talks and a tutorial session consisting of two 90 minute lectures, all delivered by distinguished speakers on key recent themes and developments in stochastic process research and their important connections to other parts of mathematics and the sciences.

The conference has two main objectives.  First, by bringing together researchers who work in the areas of financial mathematics and insurance, the conference promotes an exchange of ideas and facilitates new collaborations on topics of recent importance to the global financial system, including systemic risk, security of the financial system, sustainability of pension funding, and broader impact of financial securities.  Second, by reserving half of the speaking slots and the majority of financial support for junior researchers and underrepresented minorities, the conference helps develop a generation of investigators to form the future core of the financial workforce in academia, government, and industry.  The two-day conference has 18 speakers (six senior tenured faculty, six junior non-tenured faculty, six graduate students) and includes ample time for dissemination and discussion of new findings among conference participants, as well as a panel discussion to address open problems facing the financial community.  The conference provides an opportunity for junior financial mathematicians to confer with eminent scholars in the field.  The conference website is: http://depts.washington.edu/amath/wcmf/<br/><br/>With the recent financial crises and the continuous introduction of new regulations designed to safeguard the financial system, the landscape of financial markets is changing quickly.  These changes have opened up entirely new directions for research within the mathematical finance community.  It is the goal of the Eighth Western Conference on Mathematical Finance to highlight research in these newly developing areas.  In particular, a special emphasis is given to asymptotics for parabolic partial differential equations, robust hedging, and stochastic portfolio theory.  Cutting-edge developments in asymptotics are required in order to solve challenging nonlinear partial differential equations in various financial applications with market frictions such as trading constraints, transactions costs, and asymmetric borrowing and lending rates.  Robust hedging methods are needed in order for market participants to mitigate risk effectively in the face of model uncertainty. New results from stochastic portfolio theory can shed light on market structure and long-term investment choices."

From social networks to biological ones, the problems of community detection and clustering are paramount to understanding the nature of the network; as such, efficient and reliable algorithms for these problems are of utmost importance. Devising, analyzing, and benchmarking such algorithms often rely heavily on random matrix and random graph theory, as studies have shown that large network characteristics can often be replicated (and more easily studied) via random graph models. Thus, good theoretical results on the spectra of large random graphs are needed to understand the typical behavior, as well as the limitations of community detection algorithms.<br/><br/>The PI will work on a variety of problems, ranging from the theoretical (spectral of random graphs) to the applied (proposing and analyzing community detection algorithms). Some of the models considered will include the Stochastic Block Model and variants thereof, especially at the limit of sparseness (when average node connectivity is either large and constant or goes to infinity slower than any power of the network size). On the more theoretical side, the PI will work on problems from spectral gap (which controls properties like mixing, but also the possibility of exact community recovery in certain networks) to the empirical spectral distribution (which can be used to establish the nature of the network). The PI will also work on threshold bounds for various regimes of community detection in these graph models, and will produce software for numerically computing the asymptotical spectral distributions for a large variety of random graphs."

Usually, such a simplification is realized by looking at a smaller number of factors that are considered more relevant for the evolution of the system and by neglecting other factors that are considered less relevant. However, such an approximation, that can be effective on some given time interval, is not effective on longer time scales and the neglected factors turn out to play a fundamental role in the description of the systems' behavior. This research will analyze a large class of equations used in these models. These are highly complex equations and an understanding of them is crucial for a deeper understanding of the main features of the model and for a better effectiveness in applications. This research will develop new methods and techniques ranging over many fields of mathematics. Education and training will also be a major part of the project.<br/> <br/>The main goal of this research project is the analysis of limit theorems for stochastic partial differential equations having multiple scales. In particular, the PI will study some generalizations of the Smoluchowskii-Kramers approximation for systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom and its long-time effects, as well as the validity of the averaging and the large deviation principle for some classes of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Specifically, the PI will try to understand what happens in the regime where the noise is weak and almost white in space. Moreover, she will study the convergence of SPDEs defined on narrow channels or describing stochastic incompressible viscous fluids in the whole space to a new class of SPDEs defined on graphs and open books. These asymptotic results will be important not only to provide a simplified description of some relevant multi-scale SPDEs that arise e.g. in the study of molecular motors and fluid dynamics, but also because at the limit they provide new interesting mathematical objects that are worthy of investigation. What characterizes and unifies this approach to all of these asymptotic problems is the effort to understand how they all interplay and interact one with the other."

The class of integrable systems includes several fundamental equations of nature and the mathematical foundations of integrable systems go back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and Poincare.  Currently, the theory of integrable systems has become an expanding area which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics.  Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in modern nonlinear science and technology.  In addition to the traditional domain of differential equations, integrable techniques are becoming common in  such diverse fields as orthogonal polynomials, string theory, enumerative topology, statistical mechanics, random processes, quantum informatics, and number theory.  Many of the problems considered in the project have direct connections with these disciplines. <br/><br/>This research project continuous the principal investigator's long term research efforts in the theory of integrable systems. The principal goal of the project is to address the following two directions which have emerged from  recent developments in random matrix theory and in the theory of exactly solvable quantum models: (a) The study of  the isomonodromic tau functions, their asymptotics, Fredholm determinant representations and their relations to the conformal  field theory; (b) The asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz, Hankel, and Fredholm determinants arising in the study of critical phenomena in random matrices and statistical mechanics.  Each of these directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems, and they will be investigated within the same analytical framework, viz., the Riemann-Hilbert method.  The main focus of the first direction is on the long standing question of evaluation the asymptotic connection formulae, including the constant pre-factors,  for the generic families of Painleve tau functions. The principal concern  of the second direction is various types of double scaling and transitional limits - topics which are among the principal questions in both the theory of random matrices and in  statistical mechanics."

This is one of the most active areas of statistical mechanics and mathematical physics in the last ten years that is focused on studying the extremes of highly correlated random systems. Remarkably, the statistics governing the extremes appear to be universal regardless of the particular system under consideration, although thus far this has only been understood for very specific systems. The main focus of the program is to understand the unifying mechanism behind the universality, motivated by examples from directed polymer models. This will be done in an interdisciplinary manner using ideas from statistical mechanics, probability theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. The intellectual merit of the semester lies in its potential to establish a cross-fertilization of ideas within different areas of mathematics and connect these ideas with theoretical physics and other fields of science. Broader impact will be realized via this exchange of ideas across disciplines and through the training of a new generation of students to carry on the work in this important field.<br/><br/>In addition to enabling long-term collaborations between leading researchers, the semester will allow for the dissemination of new results with a conference on Qualitative Methods in KPZ Universality (April 24-27, 2017) and a small groups meeting on Random Walks in Random Environments (March 13-17, 2017).There will also be a research school on Random Structures in Statistical Mechanics and Mathematical Physics (March 6-10, 2017) aimed at introducing graduate students and other junior researchers to this exciting new field.

Specific instances include biochemical reaction networks, high-tech manufacturing, computer systems, telecommunications, transportation and business service systems. The analysis and control of such complex stochastic networks require solving challenging mathematical problems. This award supports research on solving such mathematical problems. Some of the work involves the development of general theory for broad classes of stochastic networks, while others focus on mathematical problems directly motivated by specific applications. Since the complexity of stochastic networks usually precludes exact analysis of detailed ""microscopic"" models, the focus is on formulating and analyzing more tractable approximations. New techniques and results will be developed in such a way that they can be used by applied researchers in areas of application. The results of this research will be disseminated through publication in peer reviewed journals, by posting on the University of California's open access website and by presentations at mathematics, science and engineering conferences. The PI will help train new mathematics researchers through collaboration with early career researchers.<br/><br/>The research addresses mathematical problems associated with the analysis and control of stochastic network dynamics. Topics to be addressed include rigorous justification of approximations, analyzing and controlling the behavior of the approximate models, and interpreting the results for the original microscopic models. Two levels of approximation are considered: first order approximations called fluid models, and second order approximations which frequently are diffusion models. An important subtheme is understanding the interplay between levels of approximation. Five topics are proposed for study: diffusion approximations for (bio)chemical reaction networks, analysis of processor sharing networks, congestion control and resource entrainment in data networks, networks with random order of service and reneging, and dynamic control of stochastic processing networks. Some stochastic process aspects of these topics include rates of convergence in the approximation of density dependent Markov chains by reflected diffusion processes, analysis of measure-valued processes used to track residual job sizes or ages of jobs in stochastic network models with resource sharing, singular diffusion control problems, foundational questions for reflected processes, and numerical approximation of reflected diffusion processes in non-smooth domains. This award will support the training of early career researchers and underrepresented minorities through direct support of a female graduate student, and through collaboration of the PI with one early career researcher and one female researcher who is at a non-PhD granting institution."

When one individual in a population acquires a beneficial mutation, that mutation may eventually spread to a large fraction of the population, or even the entire population. Modeling this phenomenon mathematically becomes particularly challenging when there can be many different beneficial mutations in the population at a time. This research project studies mathematical models of evolving populations that repeatedly acquire beneficial mutations.  Because, in these models, populations are assumed to evolve in a random way, the theory of probability plays a central role in the analysis. The research aims to provide mathematical insight into important biological problems. Questions of interest include determining the rate at which the fitness of the population increases as a result of beneficial mutations, understanding the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the population at a given time, and understanding how to describe the genealogy of a sample from the population. <br/><br/>To model populations undergoing selection, the investigator will consider a stochastic process called branching Brownian motion. Each particle dies at a given rate, each particle moves independently according to one-dimensional Brownian motion, and particles occasionally split into two.  Here particles represent individuals in a population, and the position of the particle along the real line corresponds to the individual's fitness.  It will be assumed that the branching rate depends on the position of the particle, so that individuals with higher fitness have more offspring.  It is conjectured that in the long-run, the empirical distribution of the positions of the particles is approximately Gaussian. A proof of this result would provide a mathematically rigorous formulation of the idea, well-established in the biology literature, that for certain populations undergoing selection, the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the population evolves like a Gaussian traveling wave.  Because branching Brownian motion can be used to model populations experiencing either beneficial or deleterious mutations, this work could also shed light on a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet, which refers to the decrease in the fitness of a population resulting from the accumulation of deleterious mutations. The investigator will also consider some population models that incorporate the effects of recombination, as well as a nested coalescent model that describes the genealogy of a collection of individuals sampled from multiple species."

Probabilistic reasoning has played an important role in several recent breakthroughs in number theory, including the solution of Paul Erds' minimum modulus problem for covering systems, which had been open since the 1950s.  One aspect of this project refines the analysis to study the related odd covering problem.  Techniques used in analytic number theory can be employed to study models in statistical physics that are governed by Markov chains.  Often these techniques give rigorous proofs of phenomena observed in computer models, and sometimes the rigorous analysis uncovers errors from model predictions that result from a limited model size.  The project aims to extend recent strong estimates on the spectral expansion of the shape of cubic fields to similar spectral estimates for the shapes of quartic and quintic fields.<br/><br/>The solution of the minimum modulus problem combines the method of moments with techniques from probabilistic combinatorics, including the Lovasz local lemma and the use of pseudo-random measures.  In developing quantitative results regarding covering systems, this project will apply structural decomposition techniques currently in use in additive combinatorics.  Oscillatory integrals, the method of stationary phase, and van der Corput's method are used frequently in analytic number theory to obtain sharp estimates.  These techniques are often useful also in the asymptotic analysis of the mixing time of Markov chains, and will be employed in continued work on analysis of the two-dimensional abelian sandpile model and a new local limit theorem on nilpotent groups."

The proposal addresses questions from combinatorics and computer science about when random combinatorial and computational problems have solutions, such as when there is a colouring in a random graph.  Ideas from statistical physics give predictions for these thresholds which we will mathematically prove.  It also studies questions of how long it takes random processes on networks, such as the Glauber dynamics Markov chain, to reach their equilibrium distribution and how this depends on their initial starting position.  Such processes are used as algorithms for sampling high dimensional distributions.  The proposal focuses on development of mathematical theory with a view to better understanding these problems.  Finally the proposal will support the development of new graduate courses in discrete probability and stochastic process on random graphs as well as providing research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications across a range of stochastic processes on networks. One aspect involves studying phase transitions of Gibbs measures on random graphs, particularly random constraint satisfaction problems.  Here we hope to establish conjectures from statistical physics for a range of models such as the chromatic and independence numbers on random graphs.  A second theme is the development of new tools for establishing rough isometries and other geometric notions of closeness between random metric spaces.  In particular we will consider whether independent copies of Poisson processes, percolation clusters and SLE curves are rough isometries or quasi-symmetries.  Finally the proposal will consider Markov random fields such as the Ising model on lattices.  At high temperatures it will consider the question of universality of the cutoff phenomena as well as the effect of different initial conditions on the mixing time.  At low temperatures it will pursue a better understanding of Ising interfaces in order to establish rapid mixing results."

More specifically, the project studies models of (1) cluster growth, (2) randomly composited materials, and (3) diffuse gases.  Many basic and important questions about these models remain open.  One of the more striking examples is that we still lack a fully rigorous understanding how fluid equations arise from molecular interactions.  The investigator will attempt to make progress on this problem and others by applying recently-developed techniques in the theory of stochastic homogenization.  The work will have an interdisciplinary character, mixing results from probability and analysis.  The project will make use of computer simulation to empirically test ideas during development of the theory.<br/><br/>Techniques in quantitative stochastic homogenization, particularly those used to obtain optimal rates in the elliptic setting, are now mature enough to attack problems that previously did not seem to be amenable to this approach.  The basic homogenization idea remains the same, namely, to view the microscopic models as perturbations of their smooth macroscopic limits.  The key new insight is that the regularity theory of the macroscopic limit often has a microscopic analogue.  Examples of possible applications include the derivation of the Landau equation as a scaling limit of interacting particles and Anderson localization for a Bernoulli potential on the lattice.  This approach has already proved successful, and the investigator expects it to continue to yield new results."

Probability turns out to be a particularly useful tool as it has, by its very nature, the means to deal with systems consisting of a large number of individual constituents. The present project addresses questions that arise at the interface of probability and statistical mechanics whose common feature is a simple definition, interesting physical phenomena and a substantive challenge for mathematics. The specific problems start with the consideration of complex microscopic systems such as interacting random fields, random walks, local times and percolation. Their analysis aims to demonstrate that, under the conditions when the system size tends to infinity, a new structure, or a new degree of regularity, naturally emerges. The resulting object, often referred to as the scaling limit, is then studied using the methods of analysis. A crucial point is that many microscopic systems lead to the same scaling limit. This fact, sometimes referred to as universality, is one of the cornerstones of our understanding of large systems. The project also includes education and training of students.<br/><br/>The project is naturally divided into three specific subject areas. The first of these concerns the extrema of logarithmically-correlated spatial processes. The goal here is to establish a level of universality of the recent findings for the Gaussian Free Field by extending them to other processes such as the local time of random walks and gradient fields. Gradient fields are then to be studied also in their own right in a number of specific contexts. The unifying theme here is to find ways to get around the restriction of the existing theory to strictly convex interactions. The third area focuses on more traditional subjects of bootstrap percolation, where the goal is to use scaling-limit ideas to establish a sharp threshold in a disordered model, and positional long-range order, where the aim is to prove crystallization in a specific model of an interacting gas. The stated problems draw on recent advances in the field, some of which are due to PI, and they bear strong connections to the theory of disordered systems, extreme-order statistics, random geometry, homogenization, etc. Each of the subareas has clearly delineated objectives of varied level of difficulty. Many of these have been designed with the aim to include graduate students and postdocs in research."

For example, given data that lives in a high-dimensional space, what information can be obtained by studying lower-dimensional projections of the data? Given a large number of interacting agents, who strategically make choices based only on their own state and the distribution of states of the other agents, what do their equilibria (or optimal strategies) look like? This award supports the development of diverse mathematical techniques for the analysis of such questions.  The focus will be on characterizing large deviations from typical behavior, which though rare, are often of crucial importance in applications. The investigator will help train new mathematics researchers, mentor early career researchers, and be involved in outreach efforts.  <br/> <br/>The research will address three topics concerning high-dimensional random phenomena. The first involves the study of random projections of probability measures in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.  This is relevant both for the statistical analysis of high-dimensional data, as well as for asymptotic convex geometry and asymptotic functional analysis. The focus is on characterizing the large deviation behavior of such random projections, as the dimension goes to infinity. This is of interest because, unlike fluctuations, the large deviation behavior is non-universal and thus distinguishes between different high-dimensional distributions. The second topic considers properties of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions on a class of hard-core configurations associated with a graph. Whereas classical models assume discrete spins, the focus of this research is on versions with continuous spins, which exhibit quite different behavior and require new techniques for their analysis. The last topic concerns the analysis of fluctuations, large deviations and concentration inequalities for Nash equilibria in both static and dynamic games of mean-field type with a large number of rational agents. This has implications for a broad range of applications and entails the development of new mathematical techniques, including large deviations principles for set-valued random elements, and analysis of solutions to a master equation for mean-field games."

The systems studied in this project are representative of natural phenomena, such as crystal growths, evolution of magnetic domains, paths evolving in a noisy environment, and randomly stirred fluids. Often these systems exhibit nonlinearity and criticality. Nonlinearity refers to the behavior that the randomness of the macroscopic observables are related to the underlying microscopic randomness in a nonlinear fashion. Criticality refers to the phenomenon that a given system exhibits drastically distinct macroscopic behaviors when certain parameters in the underlying microscopic model reach some critical values. Time-evolutionary stochastic systems form a large body of probability theory, yet the type of phenomena considered here sits on the frontiers of current standard theories. The goal of this project is to unveil the mathematical structure pertaining to the aforementioned scopes, and to refine the existing theories to study these systems.<br/><br/>In concrete terms, the project studies three types of models: interacting particles with moving boundaries, stochastic partial differential equaitons (SPDEs) at their criticality, and stochastic six vertex-types models. Particle systems with moving boundaries give rise to Stefan?s problem in PDE, and in one particular case those systems relate to the critical point of a reaction-diffusion particle system. The principal investigator seeks to develop more robust tools that do not require explicit stationary distributions and apply to the aforementioned critical point. SPDEs exhibit criticality for certain parameters, where the solutions become non-measurable with respect to the driving noise. This research aims at studying the correlation functions, regularity, and local properties of a few specific examples of such SPDEs. The stochastic six-vertex model is a specialization of the ice-type models that can be formulated as a Markov process. It hosts a number of degenerations, including the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. As a first step toward understanding the limiting shape of these models, the principal investigator plans to study the large deviations utilizing the Markov structures of these models."

The main aim in the rigorous study of complex disordered systems is to understand how random microscopic systems display predictable and statistically universal collective macroscopic behaviors. Many such systems evolve to stationary states, but do so in very long time scales (e.g., exponential in system size). Dynamics and aging in these complex systems seeks to understand how their complicated energy landscapes governs their pre-stationary behavior. There are many different approaches in this area that will be represented at the conference, including spin-glasses, stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs), large deviation theory, and random matrix theory. This gathering will lead to cross-fertilization between these areas as well as inspire and inform a new generation of researchers. This event will attract a large and diverse spectrum of participants, including many earlier career researchers, women and under-represented minorities.<br/><br/>Many of the complex systems which will be discussed in this conference aim to describe real world phenomena and results proved for the mathematical models provide predictions applicable to the real systems. At a simpler level, think, for instance, of how the central limit theorem for sums of independent random variables predicts the Gaussian statistics which drives a large part of statistics in the real world. Besides physical applications, complex systems (e.g., spin glasses, growth processes and random matrices) have found many applications in computer science, machine learning, data science, bioinformatics, chemistry, and even areas like ecology and earth science.<br/><br/>The website for this conference is: http://cims.nyu.edu/conferences/gba60/"

An example is a cloud of gas comprised of a huge number of individual particles colliding with each other. On a larger (macroscopic) scale, this very seemingly complicated system may have a much simpler, but still very precise, description (the ideal gas law, for instance) due to the effects of the incalculable number of smaller scale interactions ""averaging out."" Other examples include the modeling of water moving through a porous rock, or the physical properties of composite materials. The derivation of large-scale, ""averaged"" laws from complicated small-scale irregularities and interactions lies in the realm of statistical physics. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical tools for a rigorous understanding of such problems under the assumption that the small-scale irregularities are occurring randomly. We would like to answer such questions as: How can the large-scale physical law, including the proportionality constants, be accurately predicted from the behavior of the small-scale interactions? What is the error in the large-scale law, in other words, what length scale is large enough that we observe the averaged behavior rather than seeing the complicated random fluctuations? Such questions are not just important to statistical physics and probability, but they also have wider applications, such as to the design of optimal composite materials or the construction of geothermal power plants. <br/><br/>Partial differential equations are used to model many important physical systems, and the focus of the project is to understand the large-scale behavior of solutions to such equations under the assumption that the coefficients exhibit small-scale random oscillations. Obtaining an ""averaged"" partial differential equation that describes the large-scale behavior of the original, more complicated equation is called ""homogenization"" in the mathematical literature. If randomness is incorporated in the model, it is usually referred to as ""stochastic homogenization."" In recent years, researchers have developed a rather complete quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for the simplest situation: uniformly elliptic equations. These equations model electrostatic properties of composite materials, for instance. The present project aims to go further by obtaining a quantitative theory of homogenization for ""degenerate"" equations as well as equations in porous media. Particular goals include rigorously justifying the Darcy-Brinkman law for fluid flow in a porous rock with quantitative error bounds; deriving the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of particles in a fluid; obtaining bounds for the diffusivity of a particle moving randomly on a percolation cluster as well as more precise estimates for the long-time behavior (intermediate asymptotics) of a diffusion in a random medium; the analysis of boundary layers in periodic and stochastic homogenization; and obtaining homogenization results for shape optimization problems. For each of these problems, the goal is to develop a quantitative mathematical theory that provides explicit error bounds and robust analytic techniques."

The current proposal focuses on those processes that arise naturally in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization. The common features of the proposed problems are simple formulation, fundamental mathematical structure, interesting underlying phenomena and non-trivial impacts on physical disciplines. One main aspect of the proposal is on extreme values for Gaussian processes. An example question is on the geometry of level sets for some spatial processes, and in particular whether one could walk on a random surface while staying on high mountains most of the time.  Another main aspect is on  phase transitions of random constraint satisfaction problems, and an example question is to decide whether there exists an assignment simultaneously satisfying a collection of random boolean formulae.  In addition, the PI intends to apply probability in related areas such as statistical learning and biological evolution. For example, the PI wishes to understand how features of individuals influence the structure of social network and what could be learned about individuals from the network structure.   Finally, the PI intends to provide research opportunities for both graduate students in probability theory, and to develop topic courses that bring probability techniques to students in related areas.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications on a number of stochastic processes in statistical physics and optimization. In the direction of Gaussian processes, the proposal focuses on a number of aspects including the geometry of level sets for two-dimensional Gaussian free fields, an improvement on majorizing measure theory, as well as the connection between Gaussian free fields and random walks.  For instance, we intend to study the random geometry and random motion on the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, which is connected to the Liouville quantum gravity.  In the direction of random CSPs and optimization problems, the proposal features the intriguing phase transitions of the solution spaces predicted by statistical physicists. Since most classical NP-complete problems are expressed as CSPs and random CSPs are a rich source of computationally hard CSPs, the proposed study of random CSPs are expected to shed light on underlying barriers to algorithmic performance. Some of the study of random combinatorial optimization problems is related to understanding the average complexity of certain widely-used algorithms.  Furthermore, the PI proposes to study certain probabilistic models for social network such as random geometric graphs,  as well as the NK-fitness model in biological evolution with the aim of providing mathematical explanation to some experimental findings."

In the last half century, random matrices found applications in a wide range of areas both within mathematics (e.g., combinatorics, number theory, and the study of interacting stochastic systems) and various other fields as well (e.g., information theory, financial mathematics, and RNA-folding). In the recent years, a new characterization has been established for limit laws of random matrices via the spectra of certain random self-adjoint differential operators. This provides a new connection between random matrices and self-adjoint operators more than half a century after Wigner's original idea.

The project also includes investigations related to the study of the large-scale behavior of interacting stochastic systems. It is conjectured that a wide family of one-dimensional interacting stochastic systems share an unusual scaling behavior with limit distributions related to random matrix theory; this is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.

The principal investigator will further develop methods to study these types of equations. He will also organize conferences and develop courses on this topic.  <br/><br/>Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) arise from extremely important models in areas such as statistical physics, quantum field theory and fluid mechanics. Solving these equations, including proving existence and uniqueness of their solutions, is exceedingly difficult. This is often due to the presence of very singular random forcing, as well as nonlinearities. Various solution theories were established based on different approaches, the most powerful of which is the theory of regularity structures introduced by Hairer around 2013 and further developed by the PI and a few other authors since then. This research will apply the theory, combined with ideas from other areas such as quantum field theory to investigate more SPDE problems. The PI will provide solutions to new important examples of SPDEs, including equations with gauge symmetry and the sine-Gordon equation near criticality. The PI also plans to prove scaling limit results for these singular SPDEs. In particular the PI will study convergence of discrete systems, such as the Glauber dynamics of ferromagnetic systems and directed polymers in random media, to the solutions to these SPDEs in various scaling regimes.

The main goals of statistical mechanics are to describe large-scale behavior and phase transitions through mathematical methods. One of the most interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the resulting ensemble. A simple example of this is the water/ice transition under a pressure gradient induced by gravity. The principal investigator proposes to study mathematical models of such behavior in a variety of basic settings, in hopes of understanding their common features and to be able to predict similar behavior in other potentially more complex systems.<br/><br/>The notion of limit shape in probability describes the property of large random systems to settle into a fixed, nonrandom state in the limit of large system size. Typically limit shapes arise due to a combination of entropic considerations and energy minimization. Several diverse areas where limit shapes have been shown to arise are in the theory of random graphs with subgraph density constraints, random tilings with imposed boundary conditions, and random configurational models such as ""square ice."" These examples are all studied through variational formulations. By studying their common features the PI hopes to learn more about the limit shape phenomenon in general."

While one can try to directly model such systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.<br/><br/>Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems, observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model, Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur / Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently, these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately. The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena."

The conference features a series of ten lectures by mathematician Alice Guionnet. Probability, as a field, seeks to understand how large, complex random systems manifest deterministic behaviors, and universal fluctuations around them. Matrices are fundamental objects in mathematics and all of science -- they encode transformations of space, descriptions of atoms in physics, chains of chemical reactions and probabilities in chemistry, and series of observations in experimental sciences, and they are vital in signal processing. In many applications, there is noise present in the system under study, and the associated matrices end up having structured but random entries. The fundamental challenge becomes to understand the effect of noise on these structures. How does it change the key properties of these objects, and how can statistical methods be developed to separate the signal from the noise? The principal lecture series will report on some of the most exciting new advances in tackling these types of questions. The meeting also will include presentations by other experts in the subject area.  There will also be daily tutorials and problem sessions, with lecture notes provided in advance to help students prepare adequately.<br/><br/>Understanding the large-dimension asymptotics of random matrices or related models such as random tilings has been of great interest for the last twenty years within probability, mathematical physics, and statistical mechanics. Because such models are highly correlated, classical methods based on independent variables fail. Special cases have been studied in detail thanks to specific forms of the laws, such as determinantal laws. These lectures will discuss a general class of models using the so-called Dyson-Schwinger equations and generalizations. The ten lectures cover the following subjects: law of large numbers in random matrices and concentration of measure; central limit theorem in the one-cut case; generalization to the discrete setting of tiling models; topological expansions for large-N asymptotics of partition functions; and generalization to several-cut models.  Additional talks will be presented by Charles Bordenave (University of Toulouse), Gaetan Borot (Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn), Paul Bourgade (New York University), Vadim Gorin (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Antti Knowles (ETH Zurich).<br/><br/>The website for this conference is: http://www.math.columbia.edu/department/probability/seminar/Guionnet.html"

A familiar yet complex and mathematically interesting example is card shuffling, which serves as a model for many important phenomena involving the idea of mixing. More generally, randomness is used in modeling a wide range of systems, from polymers and DNA to image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, and the behavior of financial markets. Random processes are also used as important tools for efficient computations and simulation. In all these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the behavior of the process. This research project is concerned with the fundamental properties of such stochastic processes and their relationship to global structures.<br/><br/>The project focusses on Markov processes that are defined in terms of a related geometric or algebraic structure. The long-term and global properties of these processes are determined by and often reflect the global structure of the underlying space. The project involves questions at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability with a major role played by groups and their actions. Partial differential equations and potential theory, i.e., the study of harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation, are also at the center of many of these considerations. Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold and random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups provide key examples."
