This research               will investigate the applications of this branch of analysis to a               wider range of topics in probability and statistics, particularly               to infinitely divisible distributions and Levy processes, to                    nonparametric function estimation, to long-range dependence of                  variables, and to regression problems with infinite variance                    and/or large deviations.  Multivariate subexponentiality, a                     related concept, will be studied as it relates to tail-behavior                 of extremes and of sums of random variables."

Many of these mathematical problems have                      important practical applications.  The research focusses on the                 estimation of the distributions of extremes and uses as its                     principal tool the weak convergence of a point process which                    records the  extremes.  The research in statistical inference for               extreme values includes investigation of properties of the                      extremal index and estimation of marginal tail distributions for                weakly dependent variables; the research on asymptotic theory for               sums of dependent variables seeks to define large classes of                    processes for which convergence can be established; and problems                in inference for stable processes considers harmonizable stable                 processes and the moving average stable process."

A                        particular family of statistical tests that can detect specific                 instances of gene conversion as well as cryptic patterns of gene                conversion will be studied.  One aim will be to develop                         parametric models that would allow gene conversion and point                    mutation rates to be jointly estimated from DNA sequence data.  A               second major goal will be to apply these techniques to study gene               conversion in the Alu family of repeated sequences, which has                   about 500,000 repeats in the human genome and constitutes about 5               per cent of total human DNA.  The subfamily structure and                       relationships of the Alu repeats will also be studied, both for                 their own sake and for the extent to which family heterogeneity                 may affect statistical tests for gene conversion.                                    The spontaneous mutation of genetic material is a major                    contributor both to evolution and to genetic disease.  In many                  particular cases this mutation, rather than being purely random,                has been shown to be the result of a conversion or copying                      process from nearby similar genetic material. The first part of                 the proposal will develop tests for detecting a cryptic pattern                 of gene conversion that may appear purely random, and to estimate               the relative importance of the two mutational processes at a                    particular genetic loci.  A significant pattern of gene                         conversion may imply a similar nearby genetic locus.  Alu                       sequences are not only interesting for what they can tell about                 the evolution and structure of genetic material, they also have                 been used as tags of pieces of human DNA that have been cloned                  into bacterial plasmids or yeast chromosomes.  If nearby Alu                    sequences show a pattern of gene conversion under certain                       circumstances, this can help to piece together these clones in                  the construction of the human genomic map."

AB percolation is               a variant of the classical percolation model,  introduced for the               study of antiferromagnets and gelation processes.  AB percolation               models behave quite differently from classical percolation                      models, by exhibiting multiple phase transitions in some                        lattices, and no phase transitions in others.  In this project                  the investigator will study why these differences occur.  The                   random graph theory research continues to explore the behavior of               the Erdos-Renyi random graph models near the phase transition                   value."
