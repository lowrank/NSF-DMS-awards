These studies lie in the intersection of analysis, geometry, and probability, and the study of solutions to stochastic differential equations and their generators is a uniting framework of many of the problems considered.<br/><br/>Probability provides a powerful tool in analysis and geometry, and stochastic processes give tractable models for many physical and biological phenomena.  For example, Brownian motion gives a way of understanding heat flow on a space.  The PI will investigate properties of several stochastic processes on spaces which occur naturally in some physical or biological applications.  Sub-Riemannian manifolds arise in classical and quantum mechanics, and certain geometric quantities are best understood in this setting.<br/>Infinite dimensional spaces appear in physics in quantum field theory and string theory.  Levy processes have recently been a subject of intense research, due in part to new applications in finance.  ``Tree space'' models the space of all phylogenetic trees.<br/>The research during this grant period should have implications in various mathematical disciplines, such as harmonic analysis, functional analysis, and mathematical physics, and should find applications in other scientific fields, such as physics and biology."

The proposal will concentrate on relevant but less studied situations when these systems are out of equilibrium, when particles interactions are not finite-range, and when the systems are disordered.  <br/>Specific questions focused upon include (1) large deviations of a tagged particle in symmetric simple exclusion processes, (2) hydrodynamics, and stable process limits of a tagged particle in long range exclusion models, (3) hydrodynamics and tagged particle limits in zero-range systems with random rates, and (4) diffusive limits of a tagged particle in bounded rate zero- range processes.<br/><br/>Understanding the motion of a tagged interacting with others in large scale systems is important in many applied contexts such as traffic, queues, fluids, and granular and molecular flows, and is also a long standing concern in statistical physics with regard to formulating the physical basis of Brownian motion.  One of the main difficulties in the analysis is that the bulk contribution from the other particles is not easily incorporated into the asymptotics of the tagged particle.  In this context, a main thrust of the proposal is to develop mathematical techniques to handle complex microscopic particle interactions so that different types of macroscopic tagged particle behaviors may be captured.<br/>"

Recently, several classical results from probability theory have been extended to the broader setting of these measures.  These new results appear to be out of reach of the classical probabilistic reasoning based on independence which is replaced by the geometric notion of convexity. The PI intends to further investigate the geometric parameters of high-dimensional measures and in particular the geometry of   generalized centroid bodies associated to these measures. With this approach and applying techniques from local theory of Banach spaces, classical convexity,  probability and information theory, the PI wishes  to attack various open problems related to log-concave measures such as small ball probability estimates and the hyperplane conjecture, as well as, various conjectures in the theory of convex bodies such as the regularity of the entropy numbers and the optimal bound of the minimal mean width. <br/><br/>There is a general principle that underlies the research in this proposal: the tendency of high dimensional systems to congregate around typical forms. This is a central fact that influences the study of complex systems which appear in probability, combinatorics, statistical physics and complexity. The unexpected regularity of high dimensional convex bodies when viewed as probability spaces is expected to add a new component to our understanding of this general principle.

The current  proposal consists of several directions of research that will attempt to build upon recent progress. One project  proposes to study whether the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities for the distribution of the overlaps, which arise from a certain stochastic stability property of the Gibbs measure, imply the Parisi ultrametricity conjecture. Another project concerns a number of natural analogues of the Guerra replica symmetry breaking interpolation for various spin glass models, such as the perceptron, Hopfield, diluted p-spin and p-sat models. In all these models such interpolations formally reproduce the solutions predicted by theoretical physicists, but since the methodology of <br/>the proof of the Parisi formula in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model does not directly apply to these models, one needs to find new ways to control the error terms in these interpolations.

P. Feynman as a conceptual tool for the understanding of the quantum field theory of elementary particle physics. They provide a bridge from classical mechanics and field theory to their quantum counterparts.<br/>These integrals have become ubiquitous in physics and provide a foundation for our current understanding of a wide array of subjects: quantum electro and chromodynamics, the standard model of elementary particle physics, the theory of superconductivity, the statistical mechanics of phase transitions, turbulence, financial derivatives, and much more.<br/> From a mathematical standpoint the main question they pose is that of the construction and study of infinite dimensional probability measures in spaces of functions or distributions.<br/>The last decades have seen impressive results and successes in this area, and key to these successes is the renormalization group. The later can be described in nontechnical terms as follows. Consider a very large population of voters which have to opt between say two political parties. One can group them according to a hierarchy of larger and larger geographical regions, for instance county, state, nation, etc. One can also assign a `super elector' for each such region whose vote is determined by the majority at the next more detailed level of representation. In a nutshell the renormalization group is the transformation from the configurations of voting odds at one representation level to the next coarser one.<br/>The iteration of this transformation allows one to make predictions about the macroscopic behavior of this complex interacting system (the odds on say the majority vote at the national level)  starting from the microscopic behavior (a mathematical model for the odds at the level of individuals). The above analogy with voting is given simply for the sake of exposition. In physics, one would, instead of voters, consider for instance spins or magnetic moments at the atomic level, and try to use the renormalization group machinery in order to infer the overall magnetization of a piece of material such as iron.<br/><br/>The importance of the renormalization group in physics lies not in the mere qualitative description given above, but rather  in  the quantitative approximation scheme  which has been developed on the basis of this intuition. The main goal of the proposed activity is to develop mathematical tools which allow a rigorous control of the error terms in this approximation scheme. The PI will in particular focus on the study of complete renormalization group trajectories between two fixed points, i.e., situations where one needs to control a system over the full range of scales from the infinitely small to the infinitely large. The PI will study such trajectories on a variety of models such as phi-four with a modified propagator in three dimensions, and the Gross-Neveu model in two dimensions.<br/>An important component of the proposed activity is graduate education. <br/>The PI will foster the involvement<br/>of graduate students in the proposed research work and will provide them with training in the mathematical tools from constructive quantum field theory and renormalization group theory needed in order to tackle research problems in the area."

An important subtheme is understanding the interplay between the levels of approximation.<br/>Four topics are being studied:<br/>(i)  dynamic scheduling for stochastic processing networks,<br/>(ii) analysis of processor sharing networks,<br/>(iii)  connection level models for data networks,<br/>(iv) stochastic systems with delayed dynamics and state constraints. <br/>Some stochastic process aspects of these topics include study of singular diffusion control problems, analysis of measure-valued processes used to keep track of residual job sizes, foundational questions for reflected processes, and the asymptotic properties of functional stochastic differential equations with natural state constraints. Specific applications being investigated include Internet congestion control and biochemical reaction networks.<br/><br/><br/>Stochastic networks are mathematical models for complex systems involving dynamic interactions subject to uncertainty. Such networks arise in a wide variety of applications in science and engineering, especially in operations research, computer science, electrical engineering and bioscience/bioengineering. This grant funds research on mathematical problems arising from the need to analyse and control such stochastic networks. Two fundamental problems for such networks are<br/>(a) to identify and understand mechanisms that stabilize the systems, and<br/>(b) to quantify the performance of the systems under such stabilizing mechanisms.<br/>The networks under study are substantially more general than those that have been rigorously studied to date. Through their complexity and heterogeneity, these networks present challenging mathematical problems. This project involves the development of new mathematical theory and techniques as well as the application of this theory in studying specific problems such as Internet congestion control and understanding gene regulation. Collaborations with researchers familiar with areas of application, the training of graduate student researchers, and the dissemination of research results through publication in peer reviewed journals and presentations at cross-disciplinary research conferences are integral parts of the project."

In recent years, the investigator and his collaborators have made considerable progress in identifying simple, descriptive conditions on observable characteristics, such as diversity or sufficient intrinsic volatility, which allow the construction of simple (based solely on observable quantities) portfolios  that can outperform a large equity market.  This project seeks to build on these results in order to understand the nature of optimal, that is, ""least-expensive"", arbitrages of this type, and their connections to stochastic analysis (exit measures for supermartingales, degenerate diffusions), parabolic partial differential equations (propagation of qualitative properties such as convexity), and the fine structure of financial markets (the onset of arbitrage opportunities, or of ""bubbles"", and its implications for pricing and for hedging).  Additionally, the investigator has gained considerable understanding of stochastic control problems with discretionary stopping, when a ""controller"" (a player who affects the dynamics of the game) and a ""stopper"" (a player who decides the duration of the game) cooperate to minimize an expected cost.  This project embarks on an effort to understand non-cooperative versions of such games, both in zero-sum and in non-zero-sum contexts. A rich theory seems to emerge, and we intend fully to pursue its development as described in the proposal. Furthermore, research will focus on such stochastic optimization problems in the presence of unobservable parameters, modeled in a Bayesian framework by means of random variables with known prior distributions and continuous updating. Such problems are notoriously hard to solve explicitly, but we have ambitious plans in this direction and some preliminary results. <br/><br/>Stochastic portfolio theory is a relatively novel mathematical framework for analyzing portfolio behavior and equity market structure; it is descriptive as opposed to normative, is consistent with observable characteristics of actual portfolios and real markets, and provides a theoretical tool (with insights into questions of arbitrage, construction of portfolios with controlled behavior, etc.) which is also useful for practical applications. Optimization problems that involve features of both stochastic control and optimal stopping arise, for instance, in the study of target-tracking models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived ""sufficiently close"", and then to decide whether to engage the target or not. Problems of combined optimal stochastic control/stopping also arise in Mathematical Finance: in the context of computing the upper- and lower-hedging prices of American contingent claims under portfolio constraints; in portfolio/consumption problems with an embedded ""retirement"" option; in the study of dynamic measures for managing risk; in the context of dynamically consistent utilities; and in stochastic games of the principal/agent type. Stochastic control with partial observations has implications for the adaptive sequential detection of change-points, for signal processing, for finance, and for other fields of application where learning about unknown parameters and dynamic system optimization have to take place simultaneously, and in real time."

A random matrix is used  to model a typical behavior in many problems arising in high-dimensional convexity, functional analysis, as well as in physics and computer science. In all these areas the size of a matrix, i.e. the available number of degrees of freedom is very large, but fixed. This project aims to investigate the spectral phenomena which arise with high probability, and obtain explicit probability bounds. One of the central questions here is evaluation of the probability that a large random matrix is non-singular, and obtaining quantitative characteristics of non-singularity. To this end, the project brings into play a wide array of tools, ranging from classical probability, to asymptotic geometric analysis, and additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is currently undergoing a period of rapid development. In a large part this is due to the demand for explicit probabilistic estimates arising in various problems of computer science and engineering. This includes, among others, the wireless communication, where random matrices are used to model interactions between antennas and obstacles on the ground. The study of random matrices is also of importance for internet privacy protection, since certain kinds of random matrices became tools of choice in constructing hacking algorithms.

It is known that if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then pricing the Black-Scholes type formula becomes delicate and difficult to analyze.  For instance, if the underlying asset price is a ""true"" martingale, then the European call price is a submartingale, hence the function is increasing. On the other hand, if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then the European call price is not in general increasing.  The project develops techniques from probability theory to build a bridge between mathematical models and financial markets.  A first main direction of the project uses the interpretation of the generalized Black-Scholes quantities in terms of last passage times in the framework of Bessel processes in order to derive fine properties of the call option process, as a function of maturity, written for the strict local Bessel martingales.  Concretely, the work aims to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding market bubbles.  A second main focus of the project investigates the enlargement filtration of the last passage time in the Black-Scholes type formula, in particular, its ""distance"" from the stopping time.  In a financial context, an example of the improper use of stopping time may be interpreted as using signals coming from available inside information. <br/>The project will develop mathematical theory and tools for detecting the presence of arbitrage trading in this setting which is also related to market bubble phenomena.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a series of market crashes and bubbles where mispricing takes place. In economic terms, a bubble is defined as a deviation between the price of an asset and its underlying values.<br/>Mathematically, bubbles are phenomena for which the discounted asset prices are strictly local martingale but not martingale under the risk-free measure. In other words, if the discounted asset price processes are strict local martingales, option prices no longer increase in maturity and Merton's no early exercise theorem does not hold. Intuitively, if a bubble exists, the asset price will increase initially, but a crash is<br/>likely to take place in the future.   It is well-known that many<br/>sophisticated financial derivatives have been built on the foundation of mathematical theories since the 1970s. As a consequence, such a rapid increase of derivative markets necessitates proper communication between financial analysts and mathematicians.  A general goal of the project is to develop a rigorous mathematical understanding of market bubbles and related phenomena.  The project is interdisciplinary in nature and will be integrated into practical applications.<br/><br/><br/>"

Specifically, in the context of the Wiener process W (standard Brownian motion), if a random variable X can be written as a function of the path of W which is differentiable in the sense of Malliavin, meaning that its Frechet derivative DX in the direction of any appropriate perturbation exists, then it is possible to form a function g, equal to an averaged inner product of DX and of an exponentially correlated copy of DX, and use this function g to write estimates for the tails and even the density of X. An indication of this methodology is recorded in an article by the PI and Ivan Nourdin. The PI plan to apply the methodology to find sharp upper and lower bounds on densities of random variables of interest to probabilists, including the maxima of Gaussian fields, and also to tackle related problems such as small ball probabilities for fractional Brownian motion.  A connection between Malliavin derivatives and Stein's method, which was discovered by Nourdin and Peccati, will also be investigated, and may help in analyzing random variables whose behavior is closer to non Gaussian distributions, including Gamma distributions, within the so-called Pearson class.<br/><br/>The broader scientific significance of the proposed research begins with applications to the effect of chaotic environments on the stabilization or destabilization of physical or chemical systems, including polymers in random media. There should be a range of spatial correlation lengths in the medium which imply a continuum of behaviors, exhibiting richer phenomena than what theoretical physicists have predicted. Taking the modeling further, the PI plans to analyze the practical consequences of the project in those areas where long memory is an empirical fact, including financial econometrics, internet traffic, and climate prediction. Ph.D. students will take part in the fundamental aspects of the research. Some theoretical quantitative issues, such as small ball constants, fluctuation exponents, and long-memory parameter estimation, will be complemented with numerical simulations conducted by MS and undergraduate students.

In the first part, the limit order book of an electronic exchange will be modeled as a queueing system, evolving as a measure-valued process, where the measure in question is the set of order sizes located on the price axis. Like many queueing systems, the evolution of the order book at the level of discrete orders is prohibitively complex. Therefore, the theory of heavy traffic limits for queueing systems will be used to obtain continuous approximations to the discrete systems. In the second part of the proposal, models for asset price volatility will be developed. Local volatility models currently in use describe volatility as a function of time and the underlying asset price. We propose to extend this concept to models in which volatility is a function of time, the underlying asset price, and one or more factors that determine the payoff of derivative securities written on the underlying asset. The third part of the proposal continues work on optimal investment and consumption in the presence of transaction costs. These problems are well understood and there are closed-form solutions in cases where transaction costs are zero, but there are no closed-form solutions in the more realistic case when transaction costs are positive.<br/>It is proposed to develop asymptotic expansions in the small transaction cost parameter of the unknown solution around the zero-transaction-cost known solution.<br/><br/>In overview, it is proposed to build mathematical models designed to reduce risk and increase efficiency in financial markets. Innovations in the financial markets have changed their structure, and analysis needs to keep pace. In particular, the advent of order-driven electronic exchanges has spawned the growth of algorithmic trading, whereby firms trade large quantities of assets quickly. Does this make markets liquid? Does it dampen or amplify volatility? It is difficult to answer these questions because we do not have good mathematical models for these exchanges. Neither can we predict with any accuracy how various order-matching protocols on these exchanges will affect volatility, bid-ask spreads, and general market efficiency. A major part of this proposal is the development of mathematical models for electronic exchanges. A second aspect of this proposal is to improve mathematical models for asset price volatility. The celebrated Black-Scholes model assumes that volatility is constant, but departures from this assumption in financial markets are too significant to ignore. The third part of this proposal is to better understand the effect of transaction costs on problems of optimal investment and consumption. This problem is at the heart of equilibrium analysis of financial markets, but most studies to date make the unrealistic assumption that transaction costs are zero."

In the first direction of research, the PI will study stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motions. Such equations naturally arise as candidates for the evolution of rough and non-Markovian systems. A better understanding of this theory which is now at its beginnings would certainly provide a deeper understanding of non-Markovian systems that can be observed in  different settings, by e.g.<br/>financial mathematics, communication networks, turbulence phenomena. In the second direction of research, the PI will study functional inequalities, like gradient bounds for  subelliptic heat semigroups. This study could lead to a better understanding of the control of the rate of convergence to equilibrium for subelliptic systems and to a subelliptic generalization of lower Ricci bounds. Finally in the third direction of research, the PI will study subelliptic heat kernels asymptotics on bundles.  In the elliptic case, this study provides a striking and fascinating proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.

The project has two separate areas of emphasis, the spectral behavior of large random matrices and the distribution of volume in high-dimensional convex bodies. The proposed techniques for studying these problems include both traditional probabilistic tools of random matrix theory and asymptotic geometric analysis, like the method of moments and the concentration of measure phenomenon; as well as novel techniques from theoretical probability, like Stein's method. In the area of random matrices the proposer studies the fluctuations of norms and eigenvalues of random matrices. One main goal here is to sharpen and extend concentration results due to the proposer and others. The proposer will also continue his study of the behavior of large random Toeplitz matrices, a class of random matrices which has only recently been investigated in the literature, and related random matrix ensembles. In the area of convex geometry the proposer will continue his work on Gaussian approximation theorems for volumes of sections of high-dimensional convex bodies, as well as related problems about how the volume is distributed in high-dimensional convex bodies.  An important feature of the problems considered here, which is typical of the field, is their intrinsically high-dimensional nature. For example, many quantitative geometric questions are trivial in a sufficiently low number of dimensions, but deep and unexpected phenomena can arise when the dimension becomes very large. In the context of random matrices, the primary interest is in results which are nontrivial for large finite matrices, as opposed to more-traditional limit results as the size becomes infinite.  This high- but finite-dimensional aspect is crucial for potential applications to fields like geometry, statistics, or computer science.<br/><br/>High-dimensional phenomena arise whenever one studies quantitative problems involving a large number of parameters.  Besides areas in pure mathematics like convex geometry and functional analysis which are the focus of this project, such problems naturally arise in fields as diverse as statistics, computer science, mathematical biology, and physics.  The so-called curse of dimensionality is familiar in many quantitative fields, indicating the potential difficulty of dealing with such problems.  The goal of asymptotic geometric analysis, on the other hand, is to identify regularity or patterns that arise in systems that depend on a very large number of parameters, but which are not apparent for a small number of parameters.  Thus high-dimensionality in some ways becomes a blessing rather than a curse.  Probability theory is a central tool in this field, both because many problems involve randomness in an explicit way, and because many a priori deterministic problems can be clarified by introducing a probabilistic viewpoint. That is, patterns that arise in high dimensions become apparent when one looks at things in an appropriately random way.  This project deals with both these types of applications of probability to high-dimensional phenomena.<br/><br/>"

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3. <br/>Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.<br/><br/>Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component."

However, it has been a challenge to provide a rigorous quantitative version of this notion because it involves large numbers of genes with complex interactions, and yet the resulting patterns of aging should be fairly insensitive to the underlying specifics. One part of the project aims to improve understanding of this important problem in evolutionary biology and biodemography using ideas from infinite-dimensional, non-linear dynamical systems.<br/><br/>Another common question in evolutionary biology is whether evolutionary<br/>processes leave some sort of signature in the shape of the phylogenetic tree of<br/>a collection of present day species. Similarly, with the increasing availability of large amounts of data, computer scientists wonder if the current structure of a large network that has grown over time reveals something about the dynamics of that growth. Motivated by such questions, one seeks ""statistics"" that somehow summarize the shape of trees and more general graphs, and to determine the behavior of these quantities when the graphs are generated by specific mechanisms. <br/>Mathematically natural candidates for such descriptors are the so-called<br/>eigenvalues of the graph. Two further goals of the project are, firstly, to use<br/>relatively simple techniques from linear algebra and probability to understand<br/>the eigenvalues of broad classes of large random graphs, and, secondly, to use<br/>ideas from the theory of Martin boundaries to delineate fully all the possible<br/>ways that certain models for growing trees can behave when the tree becomes large.<br/><br/>The last objective of the proposal is to study how the age of the <br/>most-recent-common ancestor (MRCA) of a population changes over time. Any asexually reproducing population has a unique MRCA, from whom the entire population is descended. In sexually reproducing species, the same is true for each non-recombining piece of DNA. For instance, our ""mitochondrial Eve"" from whom all modern-day humans inherited their mitochondrial DNA is estimated to have lived around 180,000 years ago. As time progresses into the future, eventually the mitochondrial lineages of all but one of the daughters of the current  mitochondrial Eve will die out, at which point the new mitochondrial Eve will have lived somewhat later in time. The proposed research will investigate the dynamics by which the age of the MRCA varies."

Applications include estimate of parameters arising from probabilistic models, approximation of exact p-values in statistics, and efficient algorithms for approximate solutions to NP complete and \#P complete problems.

Statistics, finance, signal processing, physics, and genetics are but some of the areas that have benefited from the injection of randomness into the design of algorithms.  However, existing methods are not without difficulties.  A new class of algorithms called perfect sampling methods solves many of these problems in specific cases, but their applicability is limited.

Asymptotic geometric analysis deals with geometric properties of finite dimensional convex bodies as the dimension grows to infinity. In her research the PI uses methods from both areas, as well as probabilistic tools and concentration  phenomena, to get a better understanding of the structure of convex sets. The  PI was able to prove a variety of results where such structural aspects of convex sets play a role: in approximation of convex bodies by polytopes; to establish a link between the so called order statistics (which are fundamental objects in statistics)  and Orlicz norms; to determine the ``sizes"" of certain (convex) sets that appear naturally in quantum information theory.<br/>A further focus  of the PI's research is the development of affine invariants.  <br/>The PI and her collaborators started the  systematic study of (affine invariant) functionals associated with convex bodies and their corresponding inequalities. Among the most important such functionals are  affine surface area and p-affine surface area . The affine isoperimetric inequalities related to them are more powerful than their Euclidean relatives and related to  other important inequalities, e.g. <br/>the  Santalo- and Inverse Santalo- inequalities. The latter is related to Mahler's conjecture which is still open in dimension 3 and higher.<br/><br/>A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""

The theoretical problems are concerned with spectral properties of large dimensional random matrices. More precisely, four of the main objectives of the program are: 1) further develop new covariance estimation methods;  2) further our understanding of the spectral properties of relevant large random matrices; 3) find and contribute to areas of application where this high-dimensional statistics framework is relevant; 4) train graduate students in high-dimensional statistics and make undergraduate students at least aware of possible pitfalls of classical methods and of better alternatives when available. More specifically, statisticians are now often faced with ""n by p"" data matrices X, for which p, the number of variables recorded per observations, is of the same order of magnitude as n, the number of recorded observations, and p and n are both large. The sample   covariance matrix computed from this data is of great importance to a number of applications, as it underlies widely used methods like principal components analysis. However, the theoretical results which underlie the method, classically developed in the ""small p and large n"" setting, fail to apply in the ""large n and large p"" setting just described. Hence, a thorough study of sample covariance matrices in this setting is needed. Eigenvalues of such large dimensional matrices are of particular interest. The investigator plans to launch a multi-pronged effort to get at various kinds of properties of these objects: for instance, he plans to develop theoretical results that will allow inferential work to be done from computation of extreme eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices, develop new methods of estimation of the whole covariance matrix, and also work on the impact of naively plugging-in the sample covariance matrix as a proxy for the population covariance in certain optimization problems which depend on this latter parameter. An effort will be made to try and apply this theoretical work to real-world problems, both to raise awareness in applied communities about the pitfalls associated with high-dimensional covariance matrices, and to shape the models that will be studied to be of most relevance to applied researchers.<br/><br/>Technological progress allows us to store and use massive amounts of data about many aspects of our daily lives. An interesting problem is to use the data to understand how certain traits depend on each other. In the stock market, we might be interested in how the behavior of one stock affects the behavior of another stock; understanding all these interrelationships leads to having a measure of the risk taken by investing in portfolios that use the corresponding stocks. Statisticians have a number of tools to deal with all these interrelationships. We can discover ways to look at the data so that, even if all interrelationships are small or weak, so each trait ""should"" not help us learn too much about any other trait, we might still find combinations of the traits that carry enormous amounts of information. We also know what typical values for these combinations are, so we might be able to detect unusual features in the data set by looking at it the right way. Those statistical techniques have very wide applications in various fields of science, ranging from climatology to genetics, image recognition, finance etc... Thousands of research papers are published each year that use these techniques. However, the theory that underlies these statistical techniques was created in an era where massive datasets just did not exist. This research project is focusing on theories and their applications that are better suited to handle our current massive datasets. The applications should allow us to see structure where the classical tools fail to see any and tell us when there is no structure when the classical tools tell us there is. We also have increasing evidence that our standard tools give us often very inaccurate results about our standard measures of risk or amount of information carried in combination of traits. It seems that risks might be underestimated and amount of information might be overestimated. Part of this research program will be dedicated to measuring how inaccurate the classical results are for large datasets, how much practical predictions are affected, and how a more relevant theory can be used for correcting these inaccuracies.<br/>"

For example, a random projection of a large collection of high-dimensional data points is ``usually'' approximately Gaussian; the empirical spectral measure of a large Wigner-type random matrix is ``usually'' close to the semi-circle law.  The proposed project involves using the method of infinitesimal exchangeable pairs in combination with other tools of theoretical probability, e.g. measure concentration and entropy bounds, to prove quantitative versions of statements of this type. Quantifying such statements leads not only to finer information about convergence and dimensional dependence, but also allows applications of the relevant results in fixed (high) dimensions, which is frequently important in applications to geometry, statistics, and computer science.<br/><br/>2) Continue the PI's study of value distributions of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.  In earlier work, the method of infitesimal exchangeable pairs was used to identify a previously unobserved connection between value distributions of eigenfunctions and the behavior of their gradients.  Partial results have been obtained in certain examples, namely on large-dimensional spheres and tori; the PI aims to develop a more complete understanding of these examples as well as exploring new applications of previous results in the high-eigenvalue limit on fixed manifolds.<br/><br/>Over the past four decades, Stein's method has proved to be a powerful tool for showing that certain randomly constructed objects can be well understood by approximating by classical probability distributions, and giving quantitative information about how good these approximations are. <br/>The PI has introduced a new version of the method which can be used to take advantage of the presence of ""continuous symmetries"" (e.g., the symmetries of the sphere as opposed to those of the cube) in a problem. <br/>This new approach has already been successfully applied in studying Riemannian manifolds, convex bodies in Euclidean space, and the compact classical matrix groups, in some cases to prove results rather different from those previously known, and in some cases shedding new light on old results.  The proposed project includes applications in convex geometry, spectral geometry, random matrix theory, and statistics. Accordingly, progress made in the proposed research will cut across disciplines as well as adding to the existing infrastructure of available techniques in probability.  It is expected that the new techniques developed in the course of the project will be widely applicable to other problems in mathematics.  In particular, these techniques will likely be useful in analyzing systems in which there are two levels of randomness, and there is a ""typical"" behavior for the system, which occurs conditioned on most realizations of one of the types of randomness; such situations occur frequently in mathematics and statistical physics."

The first concerns development of a computational apparatus to derive asymptotics from mutlivariate generating functions.  This is done using complex analytic methods.  In one variable, the subject of analytic combinatorics is well developed, but in more than one variable, methods are only now beginning to be understood.  Geometric properties of the singular variety of the generating function become important, requiring further work both in the construction of appropriate deformations and in the effective computation of the resulting integrals.<br/>The second area of proposed research concerns analysis of several probability models.  One of these is to find perfect squares in products of random integers.  This model, due to Pomerance, arises in sieving methods of factorization.  In past work, we analyzed a square-finding algorithm believed to have asymptotically the shortest possible run time.  In fact we know it to be within about 30% of the best run time, but would like to prove that it is in fact asymptotically optimal.  A positive result would tell us the algorithm in fact searches for an asymptotically optimal witness.  Other probability models in the proposal include searches and sampling in trees of exponential growth, and computations saddle point integrals for likelihood functions. <br/>Here follows a ""big-picture"" description of how this research is situated with respect to problems of general scientific interest.<br/><br/>Generating functions are perhaps the single most widely applicable technique for counting or estimating the size of combinatorial classes.<br/>Generating functions encode recursive information: tractable generating <br/>functions exist when the sizes of the classes satisfy a recursion.   <br/>An explicit (non-recursive) descriptions of these numbers is usually more desirable.  For example, the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers, a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2), while remakably simple, is less useful for size estimation than the explicit formula a(n) = (1+o(1)) b^n where b is the Golden ratio.  It has been known for several decades how to convert one-variable generating functions into explicit asymptotic formulae.  Recent research of the PI and others extends this knowledge to generating functions for multivariate arrays.  An important component of the proposed research is the automation of these new mutlivariate techniques, which requires development of effective tools for computing algebraic and topological invariants of polynomials.  <br/><br/>One aspect of the utility of the proposed research on square subproducts is obvious: it gives us the run time of the main component of a basic and widely used factoring algorithm.  The method of analysis is to show that the factorizations of random integers converge, in an appropriate sense, to a certain Poisson process.  Probability limit theorems are common in analytic number theory, but the limit structure required for this analysis requires keeping track of the magnitude of<br/>the product of all the factors.   A second aspect of the significance<br/>of the proposed research, therefore, is that it will develop a number-theoretic probability model containing more information than previous models, and to which actual factorizations of random integers may be shown rigorously to converge.  The part of the proposal concerning searches and sampling on graphs of exponential growth is motivated by in part by the connection between uniform sampling and size estimation.<br/>"

In addition to their intrinsic beauty, these objects find applications in quantum field theory, statistical physics, and the theory of random surfaces.  A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.  Since the path-breaking work of Belavin, Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov in the 1970's and 1980's, it has been understood---at least heuristically---that the laws of certain macroscopic observables of these systems should be invariant under conformal maps from one planar domain to another.  Over the past two decades, physicists have developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for understanding the properties of random objects with conformal symmetries. During the past few years, several mathematicians have begun to rigorously prove some of the predictions from the physics literature, along with many additional results.  Many of the these problems have natural higher dimensional analogs that we are only beginning to understand.  The investigator's proposed activities include efforts to bring new graduate students into this emerging field and to assist them in their studies and careers.<br/>"

To reconcile the classical and free central limit theorems, he will study a noncommutative central limit theorem that was suggested by examples in his previous work. He will study similarities between the exponential families of statistics and the Cauchy-Stieltjes kernel families as a way to relate the normal, binomial, gamma and Poisson laws to their counterparts in free probability. He will investigate matrix ensembles that share similarities with such laws, and may lead to new matrix models for the corresponding free probability laws. The PI will use the orthogonality measures of the Askey-Wilson polynomials as a replacement for the above mentioned classical laws to construct Markov processes with linear regressions and quadratic conditional variances on an interval.<br/>He will also analyze large deviations of Markov chains that describe the behavior of geometric quantities like the number of vertexes of prescribed degree as they vary during the evolution of a random tree.<br/><br/>This research originated from the study of random processes that have linear regressions and quadratic conditional variances. These processes model phenomena that evolve at random when the initial and final endpoints are given by following a straight line on average. The randomness occurs as deviations from that line with variance that is a quadratic function of the endpoints.  Such processes, not surprisingly, turn out to be Markov; but surprisingly they exhibit intimate connections to noncommutative probability, and in particular to free probability that usually arises as approximation to spectra of large random matrices. Thus the PI will also investigate random matrices, quadratic regression problems, and the centrial limit theorem in a noncommutative setting.  A separate topic to be investigated are rare phenomena arising in random tree models that evolve in time.  Random trees serve as models in biology, psychology, and computer science.<br/>Rare events of interest consist of unusually large deviations from the equilibrium, and they model a rare but influential behavior of the system."

These are rather canonical very large families of correlated random variables with a smooth ``high-dimensional"" correlation structure, which are very different from the structures investigated by classical probability theory.  The physicists predict the emergence   under very general conditions of a kind of self-organization called ultrametricity. We suspect that the root of this phenomenon lies in a family of probabilistic identities discovered a few years ago by Ghirlanda and Guerra and we plan to investigate whether  this is really the case.  A somewhat different direction of the proposal plans to focus on the general theory of stochastic processes. There are indications that some new structure theorems are possible, that would in some precise sense affirm that if  certain types of stochastic processes are well-behaved according to their sample boundedness properties, then there is simple ``witness'' of their good behavior. This would imply that when trying to decide whether a specific stochastic process has a good behavior, this can be done only by finding the appropriate witness and by no other means. Both part of the proposal represent a genuinely new direction of Probability theory. <br/><br/>A growing number of large scale operations (safety of electrical networks, safety of nuclear plants, finance) essentially depend on tools from Probability theory. This proposal investigates two new directions in this theory. The first concerns the emergence in certain large random structures of remarkable kind of self-organization discovered by theoretical physicists. The second attempts to prove that there is a kind of universal method to control how large can be the ``worst occurrence'' of certain random quantities, and that therefore it is useless to attempt to do this in any other way than as prescribed by the universal method."
