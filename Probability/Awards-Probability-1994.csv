For example,   suppose we immerse a large porous solid in a bucket of water.  Clearly, how water penetrates the solid depends on the size of  the pores.  A simple mathematical model of such a process is   defined by considering the pores to be distributed in some  lattice, and to be open or closed with probabilities p or 1-p.  There is a critical threshold, p(c), for the probability at which  the behavior changes abruptly.  Below the threshold the water  penetration is only superficial and above it the penetration is  infinitely deep.  Of special interest is behavior near the  critical threshold.

It goal is to provide a constructive approach  to the existence and identification of Markov controls for adaptive and singular  control problems.  The mathematical tools developed extend and provide a new  approach to the solution of stochastic control problems. The focus will be on linear  programming (LP) methods which arise naturally when the objective is to optimize  a long-term average criterion. These LP methods will be extended to finite horizon  and infinite horizon discounted criteria. A direct characterization of the stationary  distributions identifies Markov controls and allows the value to be obtained as the  solution of an infinite-dimensional LP rather than as a solution to the  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation. The form of the constraints  leads to a natural approximation procedure which allows numerical computation of  nearly optimal controls.       This project is supported jointly by the Applied Mathematics Program and  the Statistics and Probability Program. Its goal is the development of a new,  constructive approach to the solution of adaptive and singular stochastic control  problems and of approximation procedures for the numerical computation of nearly  optimal controls. This research is expected to have many important applications.   Two such example are the task of managing a portfolio of stocks so as to optimize  some financial goal, and the problem of valuing options. The theory of option  pricing is well-understood when there are no transaction costs, but existing  methods are no longer appropriate when costs are part of the transaction. Other  examples of adaptive control applications range from robotic manipulators to flight  contpol systems of high-performance aircraft. All these systems have to operate  over a wide range of working conditions, leading to great variability in the system  paramete rs.  The complexity of these systems requires the implementation of  adaptive controllers. The practical implementation of the controls further requires  sophisticated numerical methods to find nearly optimal adaptive controllers."

Brownian motion as studied in probability theory is a  mathematical model of what one sees when one watches how cream  gets mixed into coffee or how smoke diffuses through the air of a  room.

The estimates to be developed  will help control the magnitude of the fluctuation fields  introduced by the random noises at different scales.

These include (1)  questions of optimization, hedging, and valuation of contingent  claims in incomplete markets and/or under constraints; and (2)  questions of economic equilibrium in incomplete or ""effectively  complete"" markets. With regard to (1), it is expected that the  problem of portfolio optimization with random endowment streams  will require non-standard techniques from functional and convex  analysis. Questions of pricing are formulated in terms of a new  kind of stochastic control problem where the terminal reward  function has a random component. Issues related to (2) include  the establishment of the martingale property for certain  exponential local martingales, and the representation property of  a given set of martingales as stochastic integrals with respect  to a second, given set.       Existing methods for pricing financial instruments (for  example, contracts whose value will be revealed at some future  date) assume that financial markets are ""complete"" of ""perfect""  in the sense that it is possible to exactly calculate the present  value, and hence the price, of such instruments. In reality, this  is not the case; markets are ""imperfect"" or ""incomplete"" due,  among other things, to investment constraints, transaction costs,  different interest rates, different patterns of information, etc.  Thus, it is very important to develop new methods for pricing  financial instruments in imperfect markets; such methodologies  will be investigated in this project. In a similar vein, standard  economic equilibrium theory provides ways to determine prices for  financial assets so that individual agents' utilities are  maximized and ""markets clear"" (that is, supply equals demand) -  but again, only in the context of perfect markets. This project  will develop an equilibrium theory which is more g eneral and at  the same time also more applicable by being able to deal with  imperfect markets."

If a fair  coin is flipped repeatedly and X(n) represents the number of  heads in the first n flips minus the number of tails in the first  n flips, the sequence of integers X(1), X(2),... is called fair  random walk. Reinforced random walk is constructed in a similar  manner except that if X(n) is the maximum price seen so far then  the coin which determines X(n+1)-X(n) has probability p<1/2 of  coming up heads, while if X(n) is a record minimum the coin has  probability 1-p, which of course exceeds 1/2, of coming up heads.  In words, this walk is fair random walk with partial reflection  back to previously assumed values at records. The fact that the  history {X(1),X(2),..X(n)} of the process is needed to determine  the probability of the next jump means that reinforced random  walk is not a Markov process, and renders the vast theory of such  processes inapplicable. The investigator has shown that X(n)  divided by the square root of n converges in distribution as n  goes to infinity. He hopes to refine this result, for example by  identifying the limiting distributions, and to prove its analog  for the related processes which have probability greater than one  half of setting new records, if they are at a record. Oddly, this  situation will require very different methods. In another  direction, the investigator will use Brownian motion to study  positive solutions of the Dirichlet heat equation in planar  domains, more specifically to find geometrical properties of the  shape of the domain which determine or ensure that the ratio of  any two solutions at any positive time is bounded throughout the  domain, above and below, by positive constants, a property which  is called intrinsic ultracontractivity of the Dirichlet heat  semigroup.  The investigator will study reinforced random walk. Suppose the  price of a stock always changes by one dollar. Track the price  after the first price change, the second, the third, and so on.  Fair random wal k models this under the assumption that each  change is equally likely to be plus one dollar or minus one,  regardless of all earlier changes. Reinforced random walk behaves  the same way except when the current price is a record high, in  which case the next change is more likely to be down, or when the  current price is a record low, in which case the next change is  more likely to be up. That is, the walk shies away from setting  records. It is a primitive model of a buy-low-sell-high market.  It is less tractable than fair random walk because the past price  fluctuations are used to determine the probabilities of the next  step being plus one or minus one. The investigator has recently  shown how the average net change in price behaves after a large  number of changes, namely he has shown that it is on the order of  the square root of the number of changes. He will try to refine  this result and to prove a companion theorem for the related  class of processes which like to set records. In another  direction, probabilistic methods will be used to study how a flat  metal plate cools, if it looses heat only out the edges, which  are held at absolute zero, more specifically how the shape of the  plate influences this cooling."

The analysis is based on the Wiener measure on these spaces, which plays a similar role as the Lebesgue measure in the analysis of finite dimensional manifolds. Since the Wiener measure gives rise to Brownian motion and Brownian bridge, the probabilistic methods (stochastic differential equations, diffusion theory, etc.) will be used extensively in our analysis. The geometric and analytical properties of path and loop spaces will be studied through the probabilistic properties of the so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.  The PI will discover generalizations of integration by parts formula for the gradient operator in various geometric settings (mainly for manifolds with boundary) and compute the familiar geometric objects such as torsion and curvature tensors of the path and loop spaces (as Hilbert manifolds) in terms of stochastic integrals involving the usual torsion and curvature tensors of the underlying Riemannian manifold. The long-term goal is to develop an intrinsic, geometric Malliavin calculus and to investigate hypercontractivity, logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and Meyer's equivalence in our new geometric setting and their interaction with the Riemannian structure of the base manifold.   Interdisciplinary research is the current trend of scientific research. Probability theory is a branch of mathematics which studies random behavior of collective phenomena.  In the last two decades probability theory has been applied with great success to problems from classical mathematical subjects such as partial differential equations and geometry.  This new probabilistic point of view not only stimulated research in these classical subjects but also opened new avenues of research such as stochastic differential geometry and diffusion theory. The PI will use probabilistic methods to study properties of an important class of geometric objects called loop spaces (for example,  the collection of closed paths on a sphere), which just began to gain importance in modern physics. He will show how the curvature of the base space (the sphere in the above case) affects the behavior of certain random processes associated with loop spaces and give both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the interaction between the geometry of the space and the underlying random processes."

The first goal is to  derive the macroscopic scaling limiting equations rigorously and  then to study various corrections to these equations. In the past  few years, several methods have been developed for these  problems. One of the major restrictions to these methods is a  technical condition called the gradient condition.

A related  problem for lattice gas with random field will also be  considered. Finally, the investigator will study problems related  to a time scale longer than the hydrodynamical scale. These are  particularly important because the incompressible Navier-Stokes  equation is believed to be the long time (diffusive) scaling  limit of Hamiltonian systems.

Both theoretical and  computational issues are addressed.  The theoretical objective is  to make a significant impact on the traditional perturbation  theory for stochastic matrices and Markov chains. One goal is to  completely describe the nature and characteristic features of  sensitive Markov chains and to build a clear and concise theory  of perturbations in the eigensystems of stochastic matrices. This  perturbation theory will be used to better understand the  convergence and stability properties of a variety of multilevel  algorithms for computing stationary probabilities.  The  computational aspect is concerned with the numerical  determination of stationary probabilities associated with  large-scale irreducible Markov chains with special emphasis on  those which are nearly uncoupled (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems).  The focus is on the  development, implementation, and analysis of  aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.  Both iterative and exact  aggregation/disaggregation methods are to be considered along  with some hybrid A/D techniques.       This research focuses on the analysis of stochastic matrices  and associated Markov chains concepts. Markov chain techniques  constitute a unifying theme and are the basis for an extremely  wide variety of mathematical models which are used to describe,  predict, and analyze the dynamics of large evolutionary systems.  Markov chain models are fundamental mathematical tools in areas  as diverse as engineering, economics, physical science, and  social science. In particular, analyzing and computing stationary  probabilities associated with large scale Markov chains is a  primary concern in problems involving queueing models and  networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation,  economic modeling and forecasting, manufacturing systems  modeling, and more generally in applications  where stochastic  models are used to understand the behavior of systems that evolve  with time. This project emphasizes both computational and  theoretical issues, and special attention is devoted to the  analysis of nearly uncoupled problems (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems). The following specific  research topics are to be investigated:  (1) As they evolve with  time, many physical systems eventually settle down into some sort  of steady state.  If the physical system is modeled by utilizing  the theory of Markov chains, then the steady state nature of the  system is characterized by a set of probabilities called  ""stationary probabilities.""  Consequently, analyzing the behavior  of the stationary probabilities is a fundamental issue. The  theoretical component of this research involves studying the  stability properties of stationary probabilities. The results of  this research should clarify the understanding of the mechanisms  which contribute to either the stability (or instability) of the  underlying physical system being examined.  (2) The computational  facet of this project is to develop new algorithms for computing  stationary probabilities and to develop new methods by means of  which such algorithms can be analyzed. In practical applications  such as those mentioned above, it is usually the case that the  physical system under question involves an extremely large number  of components, but these components can often be grouped into  clusters for which there is strong interaction within any given  cluster but weaker interaction among the clusters themselves  (e.g., consider the economy of the United States).  This research  effort devotes special attention to analyzing and computing the  stability and steady state nature of such systems.  Mathematically, this involves computing and analyzing the  stationary probabilities of such systems. To this end, numerical  algorithms known as aggregation/disaggregation techniques will be  designed to specifical ly to exploit the special features of these  types of nearly uncoupled systems."

The first two parts of the research concern the investigation of several multispecies models from ecology and  population biology.  These models are formulated as complex  spatial systems on the  integer lattice in which each site is in  one of a finite number of states indicating whether a certain  species is present on that site.  These systems evolve over time  according to non-deterministic local rules which describe the  dynamics of each species and how they interact with each other in  this spatial environment.  Models to be considered include host-parasitoid associations and a model for the study of genetic diversity of a species in a subdivided habitat in which local  extinctions are frequent.  These investigations are theoretical  and experimental  (computer simulations).  The main goal is to  study how the spatial component affects survival/coexistence of  the species involved.  In the third part, problems concerning DNA  sequence comparisons are addressed.    One project is to construct  a statistical test that takes all types of mutations into account  in order to assess the statistical significance of such  comparisons.  The other project is to investigate what happens  when the sequences involved in the comparisons are very  different.  Current tests always assume that the frequencies with  which letters in the  sequences appear, are not too different.

Examples include host-parasitoid associations and models for the  study of genetic diversity of a species in a subdivided habitat  in which  local extinctions are frequent.

The main goal is to st udy ho w the spatial  component affects survival/coexistence. In the third part,  problems arising in DNA sequence comparisons are addressed. Such  comparisons have revealed some unexpected sequence similarities  and there is the need for statistical tests to assess statistical  significance to such comparisons.  Currently, there is no test available that takes all types of mutations into account that  occur in DNA sequences.  Furthermore, all available tests require  the composition of the sequences (i.e., the frequencies with  which the letters in the sequences appear) not to be too  different.

Intersections of Brownian sample paths were first studied by  Dvoretzky, Erdos and Kakutani more than forty years ago.

The proposer's approach to these problems is motivated by his  recent work, which shows that certain sample paths (e.g. of Brownian motion ) are  ""equivalent"" to certain ""random Cantor sets"" constructed via a branching process, in  the sense that the same deterministic sets are hit by these two types of random sets  with positive probability.  The remaining problems have close ties to ergodic theory;  they involve the Hausdorff dimension of measures on Galton Watson trees and on  invariant sets for expanding maps.       It is proposed to study several problems in probability theory involving  intersections of random paths in space. Some of these problems were studied by  mathematicians forty years ago, but in the last decade there has been renewed  interest, as mathematical physicists have shown the relevance of this topic to  questions of physical interest.  Classical notions of ""Fractional dimension"" play an  important role in this study.

This connection leads to a natural classification of such random  processes and gives a base for their systematic investigation.  A  new approach has been necessary because the ideas and techniques  based on harmonic analysis of square integrable processes have a  very limited use in the infinite variance case.  On the other  hand, many results of the ergodic theory of nonsingular flows  have their natural counterparts in the theory of infinite  variance stationary processes.  For example, the famous Hopf  decomposition of flows into dissipative and conservative parts  permits us to identify and isolate the moving average parts of  the corresponding stationary processes.  Building upon these  connections, structural and path properties of certain important  classes of infinite variance stationary processes will be  investigated.       Stochastic stationarity can be observed in the long-time  behavior of many random phenomena when the same patterns of  behavior occur with time independent frequencies.  For example,  in a noisy communication channel the initial signal is  superimposed with a random noise giving a stationary random  process on the channel's output.  In recent years there has been  a growing interest in the investigating of highly random  (infinite variance) models.  The existing methodology and tools  of harmonic analysis, that have been very successful in the study  of moderately random stationary processes, have shown a very  limited applicability in the infinite variance case.

Sensitive criteria in MDP's permit adjustments for the underselectiveness of the average per unit time reward criterion in cases where initial stages are important and they also provide deeper insight into the nature of optimality conditions and equations. Up to now, sensitive criteria have been studied only for MDP's with finite or countable state spaces. Models with a continuous state space are more relevant in many applications, for instance, when there are incomplete observations. The purpose of the proposed research is to extend the theory of sensitive criteria to MDP's with a Borel state space. First of all models with an absolutely continuous transition function will be studied. For such models, we expect to obtain (by means of limit theorems for general state space Markov chains, Laurent expansions of resolvents, and, especially, new techniques for aggregation and compactification of the set of feedback controls) the following results: 1)validity of the lexicographical optimality equation, 2) existence of deterministic stationary sensitively optimal policies, and 3) effectiveness of a lexicographical policy improvement algorithm to get such a policy. Markov Decision Processes provide important tools for the analysis of many control and management optimization problems in which randomness plays a significant role. They are often used to optimize an operation's resource allocations among competing requirements (for example, inventory costs in maintaining a certain number of spare parts for a system versus down time costs for the system versus costs of repairing defective parts of the system in a given amount of time). In many of these problems, the long-run average cost (or reward) is the natural objective function to optimize. However, long-run average criteria are in sensitive to costs or rewards associated with initial stages, which, under certain circumstances, can lead to nonoptimal policies. Sensitive criteria have only been successfully analyzed for the case when the possible states of the system are finite or countable. There are many realistic situations, however, when the appropriate state space is a continuum, for example, when incomplete observations are involved, which is often the case. It is the purpose of this research to extend the theory of sensitive criteria to Markov Decision Processes with Borel state spaces (which are general enough to include all known situations of importance)."

The classes of noise to be studied are those which change the system behavior drastically from unstable to stable. Numerical schemes for the Lyapunov and rotation numbers shall be developed by investigating the ergodic properties of the degenerate Markov chains generated by the schemes. Computer simulations and physical experiments shall accompany the research. Professor Volker Wihstutz will investigate dynamical systems under the influence of random forces (with possibly high energy, such as earthquake, waves and wind), where the impact is not evenly distributed over all dimensions (degeneracy). The statistical behavior of the system in the theoretical situation of extremely high energy (which states are attained and how often) sheds light on the system's behavior under normal conditions. Of particular interest is the question of which types of random forces (noise) can stabilize an otherwise unstable system such as an inverted pendulum or a high rise building. The theoretical analysis shall be accompanied by computer simulations and physical experiments. For this purpose numerical schemes need to be developed which take into account both the randomness and the degeneracy of the situation."

Long memory, in the finite variance case, occurs when the covariances tend to zero like a power and the spectral density diverges at the origin. This behavior has been observed in many real-life phenomena. Sometimes long memory occurs jointly with infinite variance, for example when the underlying process is stable but not Gaussian. In this case it is the tail of the distribution that decays like a power function. The research will focus on the probabilistic and statistical properties of time series with long memory and/or infinite variance. Most of the available statistical techniques assume that the data to be analyzed are not very dependent. However, in a number of areas such as economics and geophysics, the data can display long range dependence and can also sometimes fluctuate significantly from their mean value. The goal of this research is to develop new techniques for modeling and analyzing this type of data."

The method also gives rise to several computational questions that are currently under investigation. Areas of application include a general class of queuing networks and several models in statistical mechanics.
