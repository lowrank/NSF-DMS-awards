"9815226","Studies in First-Passage Percolation and Random Walks with  Scenery","DMS","PROBABILITY","09/01/1998","07/08/1998","C. Douglas Howard","NY","CUNY Baruch College","Standard Grant","K Crank","08/31/2001","$77,394.00","","dhoward@baruch.cuny.edu","1 BERNARD BARUCH WAY # D509","NEW YORK","NY","100105585","6463122211","MPS","1263","9161, AMPP","$0.00","9815226  Howard   The work under this grant comprises two areas of investigation in the general   category of probability theory.  The first concerns rates of convergence (to an associated   asymptotic shape) and related properties of infinite geodesics in the context of certain   Euclidean first-passage percolation models (Euclidean FPP). Rigorous unconditional   results about infinite geodesics (time-minimizing paths) in the context of standard FPP are   quite sparse, largely due to technical difficulties associated with lattice effects.  Models of   Euclidean FPP take place on graphs constructed from a homogeneous Poisson process   and their statistical properties enjoy complete invariance under all rigid motions.  In this   sense, Euclidean models are a natural setting in which to study FPP geodesics.  The   second area concerns a host of problems arising from random walks on the integers where   some fixed but possibly random coloring, or ""scenery"", is assigned to the integers.  In this   context, a random walk on the integers produces a record of scenery ""observed"" along the   walk.  The issues under investigation concern, loosely speaking, what can be inferred   about the scenery by observing one such scenery record.  The difficulty stems from the   fact that one does not know the steps taken by the walk, only the scenery observed along   the walk.   Both areas of investigation involve stochastic processes associated with some type   of spatial structure.  While the focus of this research is the mathematical aspects of these   models, models of this general sort arise quite naturally in connection with a number of   interesting physical phenomena.  For example, the standard FPP model was first   introduced as a representation of fluid flow through a random porous medium such as an   aquifer or, on a smaller physical scale, a membrane.  There are also connections to other   aspects of materials science, including the formation and propagation of cracks."

The project includes the following problems:<br/>(i) To establish a rigorous, quantitative connection between the rate of approach to equilibrium of certain discrete dynamics and the uniqueness of (infinite--volume) Gibbs measure for the hard-core model on general graphs<br/>(ii) To analyze the rate of mixing of certain dynamics with the intention of improving the existing bounds on the critical activity of the hard-core model on the square lattice.<br/>(iii) To investigate the role of percolation and other techniques in this context.  In graph-theoretic terms, one of the objectives is to generate independent sets of a large n by n grid with probabilities favoring the bigger independent sets, in particular, with hard-core distribution with activity > 1.  The proposal also includes a student project on estimating the mixing rates of Markov chains on combinatorial structures, whose counting function is the nth Catalan number.<br/><br/>The lattice gas model  is of independent interest and significance to researchers in statistical physics, theory of computing, probabilistic combinatorics, and communication networks.  The easiest-to-describe motivation is that of a telephone (loss) network with Poisson arrival rates and independent holding times for calls.  The hard constraint demands that a call be accepted/active only if all the neighboring cells (neighborhood according to an arbitrary topology) are inactive.  The PI hopes to contribute to the understanding of the connections between spatial correlations (i.e. the effect of the presence of a call in one location on calls at reasonably far locations) and the convergence of the dynamics (i.e. the rate at which the network approaches, if it eventually does, a unique stable configuration of active calls).<br/>"

There is randomness in the behavior of the microscopic components, so the models are stochastic in nature.  The project covers several models of current interest:  longest increasing subsequences, moving interfaces, Hammersley's process, the exclusion process, models with frozen disorder, and the random-cluster model.  The investigation addresses two basic questions:  (1) Is there predictable macroscopic behavior that does not depend on the particularities of the random microscopic motions?  The answer sought can be the numerical value of an interesting quantity, a function that describes the shape of an interface, or a differential equation that describes the macroscopic evolution.  (2) What are the chances that the microscopic evolution deviates noticeably from the macroscopic description? Answers to this question are large deviation theorems and central limit theorems, and may involve finding an entropy function that the system seeks to maximize or minimize.<br/><br/>In many situations macroscopic behavior of a system depends on interactions of microscopic components.  The microscopic components can be of many types, depending on the model under study: vehicles on a freeway, customers in a sequence of queues, or fluid particles in a pipe or in a porous medium such as soil.  The outcome of this project is a better understanding of the overall behavior of such a complex system.  For example, in the traffic model the investigator seeks to describe two distinct situations, a low density phase and a high density phase, with qualitatively different patterns in the movement of vehicles.  In a queueing model one seeks a description of the flow of customers through the network, to understand whether the system can become dangerously clogged and unstable.  Such models form part of the theoretical underpinnings of modern communication technology.  For a model of a moving interface the interesting properties are the speed, the eventual shape, and the roughness of the interface.  These models and their relatives are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, physical scientists, and engineers.  In many cases simulations have not yielded conclusive pictures of the behavior.  Consequently there is great need for basic mathematical work to aid the more applied scientists' understanding of such phenomena.<br/>"

Three topics   concerning percolation, Ising (ferromagnetic) models, and contact processes will be   studied. The first topic concerns percolation and Ising models on hyperbolic lattices.    Although Ising models and percolation on the hypercubic lattices have been studied   intensively and extensively since they were introduced, these models on hyperbolic lattices   have just started to receive attention from physicists and mathematicians.  They are found,   by both numerical studies and mathematical proofs, to exhibit a phenomenon of multiple   phase transitions.  Although a few results have been rigorously proved, many statements   suggested by numerical studies are to be proved;  and many more are to be explored.  The   second topic concerns a roughening transition of (independent and dependent) percolation   on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions larger than or equal to three. This is the   analogy of a roughening transition of ferromagnetic Ising models. The third topic is about   a phase transition of models with low-dimensional inhomogeneity.  These models include   percolation, Ising ferromagnetic systems and contact processes.   This research by an investigator at an undergraduate institution involves the study   of percolation and interacting particle systems. These are probabilistic models, which have   been useful in understanding physical systems. Further understanding of these probabilistic   models can be helpful to physicists."

The long-  time behavior of such perturbed systems, even if the perturbations are purely deterministic,   should be described by a stochastic process on a graph related to the Hamilton function. A   class of asymptotic problems for PDEs, such as the small viscosity asymptotics for the   Navier-Stokes equations in the plane or small diffusion asymptotics for reaction - diffusion   in  an incompressible fluid, are closely related to random perturbations of the Hamiltonian   systems. The probabilistic approach is useful in analyzing these problems.   Long time behavior of dynamical systems perturbed by a stochastic noise is studied   in this project. This type of problem arises in many applications, for example, the long time   behavior of cosmic objects or the motion of a fluid with a small viscosity. The   perturbations, even if they are small, become essential for the long-time behavior of the   system. The asymptotic approach, which the investigator is developing in the project, is   the most promising for analyzing this type of problem."

These notions will be  studied from two interlaced viewpoints. One is that of various dynamical systems and the other is that of geometric measure theory as applied to recursively generated objects. These approaches naturally meld with one another and lead to some interesting mixtures of ideas. During the last few years we have developed a fairly extensive theory of the iteration of infinitely many uniformly contracting conformal maps(hyperbolic systems) and have made some applications of it to some well known problems. We would like to extend this theory to cover a more structured iteration of maps-whose governed by directed graphs or  substitutions and random iterations. We also wish to apply our theory to  geometric object obtained as limit sets of Kleinian groups or more generally a system of maps which are not uniformly contracting(parabolic systems). We intend to develop the tools necessary to  apply our theory to continue obtaining new results about the geometric structure of sets of continued fractions and relationships to classical arithmetic density results. We also plan to develop an appropriate multifractal formalism for our systems. We want to use these tools to describe some aspects of the geometry of the Julia sets of Collett-Eckmann rational functions. Finally, we want to obtain some approximation theorems which should be useful for obtaining analogues of known section and projection theorems concerning Hausdorff measures and dimension to packing measures and dimension and other mixed geometric measures. The specific problems of this proposal arise from many contexts and their solutions will involve a mixture of techniques from various areas: complex analysis, dynamics, functional  analysis-theory of positive operators of the Reulle-Perron-Frobeni us type(transfer operators), measure theory and probability, statistical physics-equilibrium states, and thermodynamic formalism.    This work arises from problems occurring in several diverse areas-statistical physics, thermodynamics, the theory of turbulence, geometry, algorithms or recipes for generating various geometric objects which are subject to random  errors and finally, to dynamical systems where the long term behavior of   the system is governed by some seemingly strange object. Our work focuses  on some common features of all of these systems. First, we intend to show  how, in a natural way, to produce measures associated with each system.  For some systems, these measures give us a means of measuring the long term behavior of the system. For some systems, it gives us a means of quantifying the fine scale geometric structure of the object produced or of stating what the geometric structure will be like on average. To each of these measures is associated a dimension, a number which might not be an integer-a fractal dimension. These dimension numbers can be computed or estimated by some basic  formulas which we have developed. This is useful for applications. This part can be carried out with the aid of computer studies and thus is of direct interest for pratical reasons.  We intend to continue to develop applicable formulas for determining these dimensions and from that how to produce the associated measures which yield so much information about the system."

The investigator plans to    work in three areas in which such problems naturally arise. These are the following: 1.   self-normalized sums, 2. generalized extremes, and 3. weighted  approximations.  The   problems in area 1 originate from the long standing question concerning the possible   asymptotic distributions of the classical Student's t-statistic. Those in area 2 stem from   questions about the limiting distribution of extreme values, such as annual maximum   temperatures, river heights and largest incomes in a population. He generalizes the notion   of extremes to a multivariate setting and proposes to study its large sample properties.   Finally in area 3, he intends to look  into methods of approximating finite sample   processes that arise from testing for dependence in data by an asymptotic process. This   should provide a useful tool to determine the limiting distribution of many functionals of   such finite sample processes.   Solutions to problems in all three areas of research should have numerous   applications in statistical inference and estimation, especially in multivariate and dependent   situations, whenever large samples are available. Eventually, it is hoped that many of the   results will lead to the construction of data analytic tools which will enter into the   everyday practice of statistics. In any case they should improve our understanding of an   interesting range of random behavior."

One specific topic is first-  passage percolation based on d-dimensional Poisson point processes, with particular   emphasis on results related to the existence and nonexistence of semi-infinite and doubly   infinite geodesics. A second major part of the work concerns a class of voter models in   random environments which exhibit  the intriguing phenomenon of ""chaotic time   dependence."" This is when the model (which is a Markov process in time) has multiple   invariant distributions and the distribution at time t (starting from a randomly selected   initial state) does not converge as t tends to infinity. A smaller, but significant, part of the   research involves continuum scaling limits of minimal spanning trees in the plane.    In the general area of probability theory, an increasingly important role has been   played in recent years by systems in which random effects are observed in the spatial   structure rather than in (or in addition to) the behavior as a function of time (as in models   of equity prices). Some of these models, such as first-passage percolation, have arisen   separately in multiple contexts, such as fluid flow in porous media (which is relevant for   example to modeling of pollutant dispersion in aquifers), polymer structure, and other   parts of materials science. There are also connections to combinatorial optimization (as in   the minimal spanning tree problem, which is a variant of the classical traveling salesman   problem of designing optimal routings) and thus to various parts of theoretical computer   science. The research under this grant concerns the mathematical phenomena that occur in   several representative examples of such stochastic systems with interesting spatial   structure. One particular issue of study is the connection between randomness in the   spatial environment and chaotic depe ndence in time."

Using an isomorphism theorem of Dynkin and extensions that they have obtained they will exploit the interplay between high order Wick power and Wick product Gaussian chaos processes and the renormalized self-intersection local time of a large class of Levy processes, to study the phenomenon of ``near-intersections'' of a Levy process and path properties of local times of Levy processes on lines and curves.  The processes considered include Brownian motion and stable processes in dimensions one two and three, as well as processes in their domains of attraction.  Marcus and Rosen plan to characterize the self-intersection local time functional as the process of zero quadratic variation in the decomposition of an associated Dirichlet process.  Given that the self-intersection local time functional has zero quadratic variation it is natural to ask what is its precise p-variation.  They plan to investigate this question as well. They expect to be able to use techniques developed in an earlier paper based on the theory of random Fourier series to expand the definition of the self-intersection local time functional by replacing measures by distributions.  They will continue their study of continuity properties of high order Gaussian chaos processes and stable moving averages, and level crossings of absolutely continuous infinitely divisible processes.  They will also study the multifractal spectrum of occupation measures and intersections of random walks on a four dimensional lattice.<br/><br/>This research deals with fundamental properties of stochastic processes.  It exposes a deep relationship between two classes of stochastic processes, Markov processes and Gaussian chaos processes that previously were considered to be unrelated.  This relationship leads to increased understanding of the two component processes, an understanding that cannot be obtained by considering the  processes separately.  These results may have long range applications in the transmission, reception and analysis of data, in quantum physics and in the analysis of financial derivatives.<br/>"

The PI, jointly with Zhen-Qing Chen, has recently obtained sharp estimates on the Green function and Poisson kernel of symmetric stable processes on bounded smooth domains.  And these estimates have been applied to study the intrinsic ultracontractivity and conditional gauge theorem for symmetric stable processes on smooth domains.  The PI intends to continue this study of the fine properties of symmetric stable processes first and then to investigate the fine properties of more general Levy processes or Markov processes.  More precisely, he intends to do the following: 1) study the Martin boundary and integral representations of positive superharmonic functions of symmetric stable processes; 2) establish the intrinsic ultracontractivity and conditional gauge theorem for symmetric stable processes on rough domains; 3) establish the boundary Harnack principle for symmetric stable processes on domains rougher than Lipschitz domains; 4) find some nontrivial estimates on the first eigenvalue of the generator of the killed symmetric stable processes; and 5) generalize the results proposed above to more general Levy processes.<br/><br/>One of the most important classes of Markov processes is the Levy processes or processes with independent stationary increments.  And one of the most important classes of Levy processes is the symmetric stable processes.  Brownian motion is the only symmetric stable process with continuous sample paths.  Brownian motion plays a central role in modern probability theory and has been intensively studied.  In the last few years there has been an explosive growth in the study of physical and economic systems that can be successfully modeled with the use of stable processes and other Levy processes.  Stable processes and Levy processes are now widely used in physics, operations research, queueing theory, mathematical finance and  risk estimation.  These widespread applications are the motivation for this investigator to study the fine properties of Levy processes.  The principal investigator expects that this proposed study will make symmetric stable processes and Levy processes applicable to a wider range of practical areas and to more difficult problems.<br/>"

Their evolution is often described at the microscopic level while questions are asked at a much larger or macroscopic scale.  The transition from one scale to another always requires some averaging at the microscopic level and sometimes, as in the non gradient models, getting rid of certain divergences as well.  In the case of hyperbolic scaling, the macroscopic equation is a nonlinear hyperbolic equation that develops shocks.  The characterization of the microscopic profile of the shock is an interesting problem.  Studying the rescaled motion of a single tagged particle that interacts with large number of particles requires a central limit theorem to be proved under very minimal mixing assumptions.<br/><br/>Many complex physical systems consist of a large number of elementary components.  Each of these components interacts in some fashion only with a few neighboring ones.  However, the large system, as a whole, evolves in some complex manner due to the interactions of the individual components.  This project is devoted to the exploration of this phenomenon, in several concrete examples.  The goal is to provide mechanisms for making inferences about the behavior in the large scale based on assumptions on the nature of the interaction in the small scale.<br/>"

One of these problems is essentially combinatorial, having to do   with enumeration of lattice paths and with solving a class of recursions arising in this   problem. The problem arose from an application in computer science, but the applications   of this combinatorial analysis extend to particle systems, and to many other enumeration   problems. The second research area is the theory of random processes on countable   groups.  Many basic processes such as percolation, random walk, and Markov random   fields are symmetric with respect to the action of some group.  When the geometry of the   space is hyperbolic, the group is typically non-amenable, and the symmetry of the process   under the action of such a large group forces the process to be at least somewhat well   behaved.  The PI will attempt to exploit some recently developed mass transport methods   to obtain such results. Finally, he will continue research into random processes on trees,   and in particular, the examination of the rotor model, the contact process, branching   random walk, and invasion percolation.   Often quantities of mathematical and physical interest are encoded in a power   series, which is a very powerful tool for obtaining expressions for the quantities of   interest, provided one can in the end decode the information.  It is known how to do this   for power series in one variable, but relatively little is known when there is more than one   variable.  Even a reasonable approximation is in general unknown.  The results from this   research are expected to include a reliable method for approximating the coefficients of   power series in more than one variable. This will then allow approximate solutions to   problems that range from path enumeration, to queuing problems (computing efficiency of   networks of production), to analysis of the speed of algorithms (the original motivation for    this project)."

For   instance, a model of  noisy propagation on trees has been studied independently in   Statistical Mechanics, in Computer Science and in Genetic Reconstruction. This model is   well understood only when the propagating variables take two values, when it can be   identified with the Ising model. There are two distinct critical temperatures, one for   uniqueness of Gibbs states and another for purity of the Markovian state that corresponds   to free boundary conditions. The second critical temperature is not known for the Potts   model, where the propagating variables can take more than two values. To study large   homogeneous graphs that are not trees, the investigator will apply a new ""mass transport   method"" developed recently with several collaborators. Problems on the geometry of the   planar Brownian path will also be investigated; a key tool will be the intersection   equivalence of the paths with random sets constructed via ""fractal  percolation"".   Mathematical biologists studying the spread of genetic mutations in a family tree,   and computer scientists studying the propagation of errors in a noisy communication   network, were led independently to the same mathematical model that was considered   earlier in statistical mechanics. The principal investigator will attempt to unify and extend   some of the earlier results on these models, by using recent probabilistic techniques; some   of this involves collaboration with computer scientists. Recently, new methods have   emerged to exploit symmetries in the geometry of the underlying network, to obtain   better understanding of random processes on it; the investigator will develop and apply   these methods further.

Much of the data collected and reported on these structures is in the form of log-log plots of some quantity versus a length scale.  This leads to the introduction and refinements of new classes of self-similar spatial/temporal models whose scaling structure is inferred from empirically observed sample realizations.  Thus we seek to calculate certain large-sample (fine scale) limits of statistical estimators of exponents and limit laws governing fluctuations.  In addition, self-similarities and scaling exponents are sought for the cascade and network models.  Then connections between the scaling exponents of the flow processes and those of the cascade and network exponents may be investigated.  The prospect of a theory which computes structure functions, (i.e., multiscaling exponents) for extreme flows from corresponding structure function calculations on the inputs and network defines the frontiers of this research.<br/><br/>A fundamental problem from environmental science is to determine the structure of river flows (e.g. extremes) from a basin given data on the local climate (e.g. rainfall) and topography (river network structure, soil moisture).  In most parts of the world the information available for the planning of dams, flood insurance, military tactics etc. is in the form of remotely sensed local climate and topography.  The mathematical formulation is based on a stochastic system of conservation equations (mass, momentum) which relate the flows to the multiplicative stochastic rainfall inputs and complex network topography via scaling and multiscaling exponents which are estimated from remotely sensed data.  One of the practical aspects of results of this type is to assist hydrologists and engineers in extrapolating localized observations to larger scales, and to regionalize predicted flows.  However, the broad mathematical framework contributes to our understanding of diverse natural stochastic phenomena such as fluid turbulence, stochastic investment yields, renewable natural resource distributions, spin glass magnets etc., which are intrinsically multiplicative in space and/or time.<br/>"

Also considered are   spectral questions for matrix-coefficient transfer operators.  Some of the convergence questions which will be addressed by Wierdl   concern the mean convergence of averages of measurements made on a   stochastic process at a random sequence of times that is chosen in   advance. Other questions concern subsequence ergodic theorems for   subsequences coming from members of Hardy fields, along bases for the   integers, and along sequences with big gaps. Results obtained by Wierdl in the previous grant periods suggest that in the context of Hardy fields, a meaningful characterization of the ``good'' sequences of measurements is possible.         Campbell and Wierdl will jointly consider another group of convergence   questions concerning upcrossings and related oscillatory behavior of   the ergodic averages. This line of research was initiated by Bishop,   Bourgain, Kalikow, B. Weiss and others.  Wierdl and his collaborators   discovered a fundamental connection between Ergodic Theory and   martingales.  This discovery---which often manifests itself as a   squarefunction of the difference between ergodic averages and certain   martingales---allows one to translate many of the results of   Martingale Theory, such as squarefunction, large deviation or   upcrossing inequalities, to ergodic theoretical results.         The so called Ergodic Theorem (ET) is a theoretical description of a   certain statistical behavior of matter.  Loosely speaking, the ET   makes it possible to make a large class of physical measurements in   two entirely different ways, but arrive to the same result.  It is useful to have an illustration: suppose we want to find out the average speed of the water particles in a cup of water.  Well, we would have to measure the speed of each particle separately, and then  take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average speed is called  averaging in *space* since we go to different points (particles) in space to make the measurement.  But the ET says, that we would arrive to the same result if we pick a *single* particle, and start measuring its speed at 1 second, at 2 second, at 3 second, etc, and after a long enough period of time take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average is called averaging in *time*.      So the above is two very different ways of calculating average speed,   and the method to be chosen depends on the circumstance.  Having  two possibilities gives great freedom in experiments.  The problem with the ET is twofold: 1) It does not specify exactly *how many* times are we supposed to   measure the speed of the single particle; the ET just says ""eventually"" the time average gets close to the space average.  2) The measurements in time has to be made *exactly* at 1s, 2s, 3s, etc.  But in practice, one cannot make measurements so promptly.  The ET says nothing if the measurements are made at, say, 1.1s, 2.8s, 3.2s, ...Our proposal addresses the above two problems:   1) we propose various ways to determine how many times does one need   to make measurements in time to get close with prescribed accuracy to   the space average.  2) We examine various randomly generated times at which measurements made will still give an average approaching the space average.  (Note Randomly generated times are much more likely to model practical   situations.)"

The relations between the long time behavior of the process and the   geometry are studied. In the context of finite Markov chains, analytic and geometric tools   are developed to obtain quantitative results concerning ergodicity. The role of Sobolev   type inequalities is investigated. For random walk on finite groups, the relation between   the behavior of the walk and the structure of the group is studied. The behavior of random   walk on infinite Cayley graphs and its relation with isoperimetric inequalities are   investigated. Examples showing exotic behaviors are produced by considering wreath   products and studying the Laplace transform of the number of visited points and other   related functionals. In the context of Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds, the   investigator will study two-sided global heat kernel bounds on manifolds with ends. This   requires hitting time estimates for compact regions and bounds on the Dirichlet heat kernel   of unbounded regions. Some problems concerning Gaussian measures on locally compact   groups will also be investigated.      This research is concerned with basic properties of certain random processes. A   familiar yet typical example is the question of how many times a deck of cards must be   shuffled to be mixed well. Random processes similar to card shuffling are used in   computer programs to perform tasks for which no efficient deterministic algorithm   is known. Understanding how well these stochastic algorithms work is important and calls   for precise mathematical studies. Different generalizations of card shuffling lead to the   study of random processes on different types of mathematical structures. The investigator   will study the long time behavior of these processes."

One important class of structures is that of self-organizing  data structures, which dynamically maintain a file of records in  easily retrievable order while using up little memory space and which  have been investigated by probabilists and computer scientists for  more than 25 years.  Such self-organizing systems have been applied  to problems in very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit simulation,  data compression, communications networks, and genetics.  The research  analyzes more realistically complex probability models than have  heretofore been treated, and in doing so provides a unifying framework  for previous studies.  Trees form another important class of  combinatorial structures.  The investigator analyzes the ""shape"" of  random m-ary search trees, fundamental structures in computer science  that also arise naturally in connection with self-organizing data  structures.  The work involves generalizing and analyzing the already  large class of recursive trees, which have been used to model such  things as the spread of epidemics, family trees of ancient  manuscripts, and pyramid schemes.  The researcher also develops a   continuous-time model for pyramid schemes and derives for it  operational characteristics which have not been obtained under the  corresponding discrete-time model.  Another facet of this  work is a generalization of the analysis of the height  of an incomplete digital search tree, or trie; the generalization has  applications to the election of multiple leaders in a computer  network.  This work relates clearly to the Federal  Strategic Area of high-performance computing and communi cation."

The first topic is devoted to the study of limit theorems for self-normalized processes in general, and for self-normalized partial sums in particular. The normalizing constants in classical limit theorems are usually sequences of real numbers. Moment conditions or other related assumptions are necessary and sufficient for many classical limit theorems. However, the situation becomes very different when the normalizing constants are sequences of random variables. The recent discovery of the self-normalized large deviations shows that no moment conditions are needed for a large deviation type result. A self-normalized law of the iterated logarithm remains valid for all distributions in the domain of attraction of a normal or stable law. This reveals that the self-normalization preserves much better properties than deterministic normalization does. This also suggests many further questions, such as what is the rate of convergence of self-normalized approximation, what are necessary and sufficient conditions for the self-normalized law of the iterated logarithm, finding tail probabilities of self-normalized trimmed and censored sums, and finding self-normalized limit theorems for independent but not necessarily identically distributed random variables. The second topic concerns small ball probabilities for Gaussian processes which serve as models in many applications. Small ball probabilities provide sharp estimates for rare events. A primary focus of this part of research is a better understanding of rare random phenomena related to Gaussian processes.<br/><br/>The self-normalized sums are closely related to the celebrated ``Student t-statistic"" and studentized ``U-statistic"". This part of the research is related to determining when the t-statistic and U-statistic can safely be used. This study will help to understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since t- and U-statistics are their building blocks. The small ball problems often arise in estimating the chances for rare events to occur in areas where such events are of fundamental importance, such as weather, economic indices, and epidemics. The first part of this research may lead to the development of a new limit theory in probability and statistics while the second part of the research may provide significant new knowledge about Gaussian processes as well as about our random environments."

That problem has stymied engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists for years. Two great mathematicians, American, Norbert Wiener and Russian, Andrey Kolmogorov, first approached the problem during World War II. Rather than catching fly balls, Kolmogorov and Wiener were trying, in the days before computers, to develop mathematical algorithms that would help to track enemy aircraft by radar. The research started by Kolmogorov and Wiener has developed into a thriving area of applied mathematics known as Filtering Theory. Filtering, estimation of a signal or an image from noisy data, is the basic component of the data assimilation in target tracking. It is of central importance in navigation, image and signal processing, control theory, automatic tracking systems and other areas of engineering and science. This research is a joint collaborative effort between researchers at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Vilnius, Lithuania, and researchers at the University of Southern California. The project is devoted to applications of stochastic partial differential equations to nonlinear filtering. The focus of the research is twofold: (1) Cauchy- boundary problems for parabolic partial differential equations arising in nonlinear filtering of stochastic processes evolving under some constraints; and (2) nonlinear filtering with distributed observation and applications to tracking of low-observable targets in images. The research will also consider the numerical aspects of nonlinear filtering. It is expected that relatively simple nonlinear filtering algorithms which are not too demanding in computational and memory requirements for on-line implementation and yet are nearly optimal from a statistical viewpoint will be developed for a wide variety of applications. The applications include air traffic control, human-computer interfaces based on motion- capture, and advanced optical and magnetic registration systems."

The goal is to analyze likely and unlikely behavior of large combinatorial structures such as random graphs, trees, permutations, and partitions of sets and integers. This research will develop new approaches based on combinatorial-algebraic principles and ideas and analytical methods of probability and random processes. The connection between combinatorics and probability is well known. It played a major role in the early stages of development of probability theory, and some classical problems of a combinatorial nature are traditionally used to illustrate how the general theorems work in application to combinatorics. Among them are random walks and allocations of particles among cells (boxes), the latter being quite popular in various models of statistical mechanics. During the last 30-35 years, there has been a tremendous outpouring of research in combinatorial probability motivated by new problems in statistical mechanics (percolation theory, for instance), polymerization theory, computer science (probabilistic analysis of combinatorial algorithms), population genetics, etc. The terms random permutations, mappings, graphs, partitions, etc. have become household names for many researchers who have discovered the importance of analysis of random combinatorial structures. The related theory of random graphs, inaugurated by Erdos and Renyi in the early sixties, has been found indispensable in many important applications. Characteristically, the deepest results have come via a combination of fine combinatorial techniques and powerful probabilistic methods. Besides the problems directly related to random graphs, the investigator will study an optimal assignment problem with random costs, a possible connection between the evolving random graph and the Diaconis- Shahshahani algorithm (""card shuffling"") for generating a r andom permutation, and various problems on random partitions of sets and integers. The accent will be made on searching for probabilistic and analytic methods which can be used for other combinatorial structures important in applications."

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) The use of random-cluster representations to study Gibbs uniqueness, dilution and its effect on critical temperatures, disordered models, lattice gases with weak interactions, bounds on critical points, and monotonicity of various quantities as a function of system parameters. (2) Two-dimensional systems (percolation and the Ising model) conditioned so as to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, that is, a macroscopic region enclosed by a long contour, with emphasis on the discrepancy between the actual and ideal shape of this droplet. (3) Confetti percolation, a model which is both isotropic and, in two dimensions, self-dual, and hence is a natural setting in which to study conformal invariance and related phenomena. (4) The use of percolation ideas to create a model which mimics certain features of the freezing of water which contains impurities. (5) The geometry of finite clusters, and its relation to the cluster size distribution, for certain continuum models of percolation. This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reflect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors; and (iv) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small- scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. The systems which Alexander will investigate--percolation, random cluster models, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems--are examples of such abstract systems."
