Two main problems are to be investigated. The first concerns the estimation of parameters occurring in hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations, while the second concerns the construction of estimators for discretized versions of the equations with nonconstant parameters.     The results of this project can be applied to areas such as  economics, oceanography, physical chemistry, and engineering, where stochastic differential equations often represent complex physical systems with random perturbations. The parameters to be estimated play a critical role in the design of technological devices and are often not known with adequate accuracy.  It is desirable to optimize the performance of such devices--both from the standpoint of economy and ecology--for a better utilization of resources."

The metastable states were   studied previously based on the physical level only. It seems   now that there are ways to treat these intermediate states of random   systems rigorously. Concerning the escape time, it is  planned to work   on proving the Aizenman-Lebowitz conjecture, which relates the time in   question with the energy the system needs to create a droplet of   critical size, which droplet then grows and covers the whole space. A   related question is the shape of the critical droplet, and the   aim here is to show that it is given by the Wulff construction.       The research is centered around the questions arising in the field of   systems with random evolution.

The evolution of the first integral leads to a diffusion process on a graph corresponding to the first integral. This allows progress in a number of PDE problems with a small parameter. The two-dimensional Navier-Stocks equation with a large Reynolds number, for exampke, belongs to this class of problems. We study also large deviations for  the diffusion-transmutation processes. These results help to describe the asymptotic behavior of wave fronts and  other patterns in reaction-diffusion equations.   Mathematical models of real processes sometimes,turn out to be too complicated for analysis. But very often some of the parameters included in the model are small (or large) in comparison with the others. This allows us to simplify the model and often to obtain the solution in a form convenient for applications. We study small random perturbations of  dynamical systems, large scale approximation in reaction- diffusion models and other problems related to an interplay between random and deterministic factors."

The investigator and his colleagues propose to investigate some of the probabilistic and analytical properties of this process. This process locally exhibits many features of the solutions to a class of stochastic partial differential equations. As such, our proposed analysis would have ramifications in the study of hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations. Also considered will be the properties of the graph of the Brownian sheet viewed as a non-smooth random surface.  The problems of interest include certain questions involving transport problems on some random erratic fractures and surfaces. Idealized versions of such objects appear in recent investigations in the engineering and  physics literature.    The proposed research involves a systematic study of a class of random processes which arise in several areas of mathematics as well as in physics and engineering. Such problems include but are not limited to transport problems, wave phenomena and turbulence. The underlying common theme in many such problems is a mathematical object called the Brownian sheet.  With only a few exceptions, the geometry of the Brownian sheet is a largely unexplored area; primarily due to the fact that there are not many general methods for its study. Among other works, it is the goal of this proposal to make some attempts at remedying this situation."

Special cases have been proved directly, and by numerical calculations. Another conjecture concerns integral inequalities which extend the well-known van Den Berg-Kesten Conjecture (rumored to have been proved recently) and suggest interesting new applications. Special cases of the new aonjecture have already been established using FKG type and rearrangement inequalities; numerical calculations seem to support these extensions. d) Limit theorems for dependent random variables, with the goal of obtaining convergence rates in terms of meaningful characteristics  of the dependence structures, using Stein's method and classical approaches.    The assumption of statistical independence of sampled measurements is basic to much of classical data analysis. It is relevant when one can assume that the data arises from repeated controlled experiments in which there is no carryover of errors between repetitions. However,  situations with more complex data are ubiquitous. The proposed research centers on the study of certain aspects of samples  which consist of observations (random variables) which are not independent,  and various models for dependence structures. Such structures are also  relevant in various models in physics, and certain issues arising in   percolation theory, for example, are also studied. Another aspect of this  research is relevant to statistical large sample theory. A good portion of  statistical theory is based  on approximations which are valid only for  large samples. Methods for such approximations for dependent data are  investigated, in order to determine the validity of the theory in complex situation. The quality of the approximations is important in deciding how  large samples must be in order for large sample approximations to be valid."

Principal mathematical issues addressed in this research include further investigation of the two dimensional Ising model in the whole of the phase transition region, analysis of Ornstein-Zernike behavior of two-and-higher dimensional correlations and related shape and fluctuation theorems, analysis of limit phenomena for almost Markovian random fields and justification of the Wulff construction in various two and three dimensional models (e.g. SOS, Ising and continuous spin Ising, percolation etc.), based on sharp subvolume order large deviation results.     Long term objectives of this research are twofold. On the one hand, powerful ideas and methods developed over the past decade in mathematical statistical mechanics--such as, for example, the method of polymer expansions, the concept of complete analyticity and the method of induction in volume--may provide both useful insights and approaches to various limit problems in probability and stochastic processes. On the other hand, most of the problems addressed in this research emerge from physical and material science theories of a rigorous reconstruction of thermodynamical and kinetic properties of matter directly from microscopic considerations. Thus, a successful investigation is ultimately aimed at a better understanding of such issues as, for example, equilibrium structure and stability of crystals and dynamics of surface growth."

All these phenomena are governed by nonlinear dynamics with a hierarchy of scales in space and time, which make their analysis and prediction complex and challenging.  Of the three broad topics considered here, Topic 1 is devoted to the problem of contaminant transport in natural media such as aquifers.  The class of Fokker-Planck equations which govern this transport involve multiple spatial scales of heterogeneity. Topic 2  concerns the fine scale structure of a class of random measures which arise in the statistical theories of turbulence and rainfall.  The mathematical theory to be employed for such highly singular phenomena is that of random cascades. Topic 3  is concerned with climatic changes and global change phenomena over much larger scales of time than envisaged under Topic 2.  Here the aim is to analyze interannual climatic events using randomly perturbed dynamical systems.    The main objective of the proposal is the development of nonlinear stochastic dynamical theories for (1) the prediction of the spread of pollutants in the environment with time, (2) making improvements in short-term weather forecasting, and (3) the understanding and eventual prediction of long-term climatic and global change phenomena.  An important example under Topic 1 is the problem of the spread of chemical and other pollutants in natural underground water systems.  Since even slightly different velocity fields of water in these systems often lead to dramatically different rates of spread of the pollution in the long run, careful and precise modeling and analysis are required and proposed here.  With regard to Topic 2, different techniques are needed for the study of the space-time distribution of thunderstorms and rainfall.  These are expected to provide better inputs into the numerical models which are generally used for we ather forecasts, thus improving their predictability. Although scientists have been somewhat successful in such short-term weather forecasting, they have had little success in the understanding and prediction of long-term climatic phenomena.  Since it is impossible to provide an adequate deterministic model for the latter, the main aim under Topic 3 is the analysis of these long-term phenomena using models with random perturbations.  An example considered is the prediction of the advent and intensity of the El Nino--a warming of the Tropical Pacific causing extensive rainfall and flooding--and its  opposite the dry La Nina.  Realistic nonlinear stochastic models are sought here and their analysis is proposed."

The work in area (1) is motivated by some recent universal results on the almost sure behavior of sums of independent random variables. Contrary to the classical results in this direction, these results do not require moment type conditions. The main difficulty is to find suitable norming and centering sequences which are specific to the particular situations under investigation. Among other things, quantile transformations will be used. The work from area (2) is mainly devoted to the limit behavior of local empirical processes which have useful applications in density and regression function estimation. The third part of this proposal finally addresses a number of questions in connection with a recent general law of the iterated logarithm in Banach space.    This proposal addresses a number of questions on limit theorems in probability and empirical processes. Limit theorems in probability such as the central limit theorem, and laws of large numbers provide the basis for many widely used statistical techniques to handle large data sets. Some of these  results, however, can only be applied under relatively restrictive conditions. Over the last decade, powerful methods have been developed in probability. It is proposed to use these new techniques to further extend the applicability of the basic limit theorems, and, at the same time, to gain some insight into situations, where the classical techniques have failed. Some applications to statistical estimation theory will be considered as well, where the main emphasis will be on so-called empirical processes."

A random sequence is said to satisfy a ""strong mixing condition"" if (according to an appropriate criterion) the amount of stochastic ""dependence"" between the ""past"" and  the ""future"" becomes uniformly arbitrarily small as the amount of ""time"" between past and future becomes sufficiently large.  For random fields, the notions of ""strong mixing"" are similar, involving the uniform asymptotic independence between sets of observations as the ""distance"" between them becomes large.  For such random sequences and random fields, both ""structural properties"" and limit theorems are investigated.  In particular, this proposal involves a continuation of some recent work by the principal investigator in which the central limit theorem is proved for a certain class of random fields under strong mixing  assumptions considerably weaker than in earlier similar theorems by other researchers.    This proposal concerns the study of probabilistic models that involve ""weak dependence,"" in which the ""past"" and ""present"" might have considerable influence on the ""near future"" but much less influence on the ""far future."" For example, the average annual national unemployment rate is one of many phenomena which appear to fit such a model; the unemployment rate for the year 1995 could presumably have considerable effect on the rate for the year 1996 or 1997 but not much effect on the rate for the year 2050.  This proposal involves an investigation into various kinds of ""structural properties"" of probabilistic models of weak dependence, and also various long-term ""laws of averages"" that such models might satisfy.  In particular, part of this proposal involves a continuation of some recent work by the principal investigator which considerably enlarges the class of weak dependence models that are known to satisfy a certain important law of averages. This proposal also concerns the study of  similar types of probabilistic models in which observations are separated by location instead of time."

Gaussian isoperimetric inequalities are studied for restricted sets. This leads to sharp estimates and extends the domain of applicability of the isoperimetric tool in a variety of settings. Small ball probabilities provide sharp estimates for rare events and so far there are only a few general methods available. The recent discovery of the connection between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems sheds some light in this area and suggests many fupther questions, in particular, the applications to approximation theory. Many of the probability estimates are motivated by the study of strong limit theorems. The research in limit theorems is centered around the limiting behaviors of Gaussian processes.  The primary focus of this research is a better understanding of rare random phenomena related to Gaussian processes which serve as models in many applications. These types of problems often arise in estimating the chances for rare events to occur in areas where such events are of fundamental importance, such as weather, economic indices, epidemics etc.  This research can lead to significant new knowledge in probability and  provide basic tools for the study of our random environment."

Using an isomorphism theorem of Dynkin and results from the theory of probability in Banach spaces and random Fourier series they will explore relationships between continuous additive functionals of Markov processes and Gaussian processes and chaoses and random Fourier series. In this way they expect to be able to use known results about each of the different processes to obtain new results about the other ones as they did in their work on local times and Gaussian processes. They also plan to use techniques developed in their earlier work to study the number of intersections of random walks, particularly in the critical and super-critical cases. Motivated by the importance of a special class of second order Gaussian chaoses related tm Wick squares in the study of positive continuous additive functionals, they will try to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the continuity of these chaoses. They will also attempt to use self-collision local times of superprocesses to construct a self-interacting measure valued diffusion and study the large deviations of  additive functionals of super Brownian motion.   This research deals with fundamental properties of stochastic processes and has potential application in all areas that deal with random phenomena. The investigators will consider data that evolves in time in a random fashion, such as electrical signals received from distant satellites or dollar values in financial transactions. In particular they will consider the amount of time the data takes specific values or is in a small, heavily weighted, range of values and how this amount of time varies as the set of specific values vary. They plan to do this for a wide class of processes called Levy processes. These processes have often been thought of as models for many important practical applications but, so far, they have b een considered too difficult to analyze very deeply. The authors plan to use several new and powerful methods, recently developed by themselves and others, to accomplish this deep analysis."

These are (1) universal results for the behavior of sums of independent random variables, (2) local empirical processes and (3) the fractal nature of empirical increments. Area (1) concerns the study of the law of the iterated logarithm for partial sums and their increments that hold under little or no assumptions. Area (2) involves the investigation of a new mathematical entity called the local empirical process, which is the random mechanism governing density estimators, regression function estimators and tail index estimators. Area (3) deals with the uncovering of the somewhat unexpected fractal nature of the increments of various random processes.   The proposed research is concerned with the study of the limit behavior of certain random processes and its applications. Very often a random process will exhibit stable properties as it is observed over a long period. The classical example is the random process of tossing a coin. If the coin is fair, the long time average number of heads will with certainty get arbitrarily close to 1/2. This fact is a special case of the law of large numbers. Statisticians take advantage of this law to construct estimators based on a large sample of data that are close with high probability to the population parameter of interest. The areas that will be investigated in this project should have a number of useful applications to the construction of such estimators."

Related procedures  have been applied by engineers to the compression of medical images and human speech.   In each application, a suitable tree must be constructed from  experimental data sets that are typical of the behavior under study. In practice, trees are frequently designed by greedy growing algorithms,  which build a tree iteratively, from the ground up.

The first of these concerns  measure-valued population models.   A particle representation is used to study properties of a general class (including the Dawson-Watanabe and Fleming-Viot) of ""neutral"" processes and their induced genealogical structure.  A major aim of the proposal is to extend this construction, most notably to incorporate selection (equivalently location dependent branching rates in the spatial setting), but also (in the genetics context) to allow for recombination and population substructure.   Motivated by problems in the interpretation of human population genetic data, the investigator and his colleagues study particular subclasses of the general models with a view to understanding the effects on genealogy, and hence on genetic data, of various assumptions about population dynamics, and possible demographic correlations.  A second area of the proposal concerns properties of geographically structured population genetics models. Recent results relating to coalescence times in these models allow explicit calculation of moments of identity measures for mutation structures (beyond infinite alleles) relevant to molecular DNA data. Conversely, an understanding of the models motivates a study of measures of population differentiation (and associated estimators) for molecular genetic data which generalize Wright's F_st coefficient.   The third area of the proposal concerns the application of existing and anticipated theoretical results to statistical questions in the analysis of genetic data.   These include exact likelihood ratios for a wide class of selective models against neutrality (and hence efficient inference procedures), the potential for use of information on the age order of alleles in testing neutrality, the correlation structure of estimates of evolutionary parameters from samples of linked genes, and the (non-)existence of consistent estimators of certain evolutionary parameters from singl e-locus data.   The project is concerned with advancing our understanding of evolutionary processes.  The development of mathematical models allows an examination of the consequences of particular evolutionary mechanisms: one may ask ""if evolution acted in the following way, what sort of patterns would we expect in genetic data?"".  Mathematical modeling is necessary because many evolutionary forces operate over extremely long time scales for which direct observation, or experimentation, is impossible.  Comparisons of model predictions with actual genetic data then provides insight into the extent to which the posited mechanisms are acting.   The investigator studies, at a general level, the consequences of particular assumptions about the structure and demography of populations of interest. Particular aspects of the project relate to models for the evolution of human populations. Various statistical questions which arise in the interpretation of genetic data are also included."

He uses methods from the mathematical fields of combinatorics, dynamical systems, and interacting particle systems in order to prove results that quantify the way boundary conditions temper randomness.  His main objects of study are currently dimer models, which can also be interpreted as random tiling models.    Crystals are ordinarily thought of as the ultimate in orderly arrangement, but at an atomic scale there is often structural disorder with measurable consequences for the bulk properties of matter.  Statistical physicists have made much progress towards modeling these sorts of structure, usually by making some simplifying assumptions.  One of these is the supposition that the structure is two-dimensional (an appropriate assumption if one is studying surfaces of crystals); another is the supposition that the structure has no boundary.  The investigator is relaxing this second assumption and studying what happens in certain standard models of crystalline matter in which there is a boundary of a specified shape having specified structure, and in which all the randomness is confined to the interior."

The theoretical work will involve (a) methods of evaluating model stability and instability, which will include both discrete and continuous time Markov models; (b) development of performance measures for stable models, and specifically comparison of rates at which such models achieve a stable regime; (b) detailed behavior of stochastically ordered or partially stochastically ordered models; and (d) robustness of system design against perturbations in assumptions. One application of these methods will be to MCMC methods, which  are currently revolutionizing Bayesian and computational statistics methods, and under this project it is hoped to develop on-line convergence criteria, methods of evaluating convergence rates, and ways of speeding up these algorithms. The other area of application is in the analysis of  complex network, queueing and storage systems. The specific types of such application envisaged include the currently high-priority area of manufacturing systems, and more general queueing systems with feedback, for which the stability and performance results to be developed are well suited.    In evaluating many complex systems, there are two steps where mathematical models, especially those in probability and statistics, play a critical role. The first step is in describing the system. This research addresses the modeling of ``manufacturing networks'', currently of central importance in the high-technology manufacturing sector. Here the aim is to describe the way in which items such as semiconductor components move around the various machines which work and rework components to get to a final product. As with many models, the mathematics that describes such manufacturing systems also describes other systems, such as the movement  of bits over an information network. The work proposed here will attack the vital question: when is such a system stable, in the sense of running in equilibrium rather than developing problems which cause shutdowns, backlogs or overflows. This modeling step helps define the crucial parameters that describe ranges when systems can be controlled: the second step is then in estimating such parameters, and here it is proposed to work on new simulation methods that enable such estimation to take place. These "" Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  algorithms"" have very wide applicability, but are themselves ""complex systems"", and just as with real systems, they can develop overflows and backlogs in usage: the work here should provide methods of control for MCMC algorithms leading to faster and more accurate methods of simulation. These simulation methods have found application in a huge range of areas, from pattern recognition, to agricultural experiments, to clinical and epidemiological areas, to environmental assessments: the research supported in this proposal therefore propagates to usage in very many areas indeed."

In the presence of conservation laws,  the Markov Process will have several invariant measures. If the  interaction is local then the evolution will take the system  quickly to a local equilibrium  parametrized by the local  averages of the conserved quantities. These parameters that are  functions of space and time will evolve according to some  evolution law after suitable rescaling. There are  several  examples of this phenomenon, known as hydrodynamic scaling:  the  transition from Hamiltonian Equations for particles to Euler  Equations  for a fluid, Nonlinear diffusion equations for the  bulk diffusion of various interacting particle systems etc. The  project investigates rigorously this transition for several  classes of models.     One of the central problems in the use of  mathematical models in the physical as well as social sciences,  is the problem of scaling.  One has a complex system consisting  of a large number of interacting components which is evolving in  time. Its properties are specified at the level of individual  components.

In a similar   vein, the risk one undertakes when buying or selling financial instruments is  typically much larger than predicted by the perfect-market theory (as recent  scandals involving the trading of options confirm).   This project will develop a   theory of risk-hedging in imperfect markets that is more general and at the same  time  more applicable to realistic financial markets than current theory.  ***"

So far, rigorous stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE's) for the mass distribution have been obtained only in very special cases (space dimension one), due to the very singular character of the noise (a result of the independence assumptions on the level of particles).  The P.I. on the American side (P. Kotelenez) recently developed a new approach to  SPDE's  which leads to physically meaningful and mathematically solvable SPDE's in any space dimension.  Since this approach starts with stochastic  ordinary differential equations for the positions and momenta of the particles and then derives the SPDE's as mezoscopic equations from the microscopic equations, the applicability of these equations in the physical sciences is immediate.  Rigorous results    have been obtained for the case of long range interaction and mass    conservation.  Together with the Ukrainian investigators, who have    expertise  in both finite and infinite dimensions, we wil l attempt to    extend this approach to a large class of physically meaningful equations     for interacting and diffusing particle systems with short range     interaction and annihilation.  Another focus of the proposed research is      on so-called anticipating  integration, arising in elliptic equations and     certain integral equations.  Anticipating integration  actually originated in Kiev and has been given much attention in Western Europe (where it is    called the ""Skorokhod integral"") in recent years but much less has been     done in North America.  The research described in this proposal is an attempt to capitalize on the different approaches and strengths in     stochastic analysis and related areas at two institutions: Case Western     Reserve University and the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian     Academy of Sciences in Kiev.  The subject of stochastic analysis is     motivated by the work of Einstein and Smoluchowski, and later Ornstein and Uhlenbeck,  on processes like Brownian motion.

Because many new researchers are isolated  from the statistical community, with little or no contact with junior and  senior colleagues in their field, this meeting provides a unique opportunity for new researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contact with one another. We hope that this conference will assist in the professional development of  new researchers, by helping them become full participants in the statistical  profession, and by providing an opportunity for them to act as peer mentors  for each other as they begin their scientific careers.  The ultimate effect of this process is a strengthening of the research base of the statistical  community in North America.   All those attending the conference are expected to actively participate by presenting their current research---either in a talk or displayed in a poster. There will be no parallel sessions. The program also includes several talks by senior statisticians and probabilists actively  involved in the most up-to-date areas of research. These people will be  invited to share their research ideas and enthusiasm for research, and to  provide tactical suggestions on how to build a thriving research program and  succeed in the academic world and larger statistical community."

Two complementary approaches are indicated.  The first approach involves the use of results about the fluctuation of Gaussian processes to explain the variability of the partition function and the convergence of the free energy of the S-K spin glass.  Preliminary results suggest that this approach is quite useful.  The second approach involves investigating the weak convergence of weighted sums of dependent random variables.  This will have immediate consequences for the understanding of the S-K spin glass model, as its partition function can be represented as the moment generating function of a weighted sum of dependent random variables.    The work of the investigator on this proposal is directed toward finding relatively simple mathematical models which provide an accurate description of the complicated probabilistic behavior of so-called ""spin glass"" models.  Spin glass models provide a theoretical description of those magnetic systems for which the interaction strengths (coupling constants) are random.  These systems are found in structurally disordered materials with behavior depending on a threshold transition temperature.  The randomness of the interaction strengths arises because of impurities within the materials.  The theoretical work proposed here promises to provide a better understanding of the variability in the behavior of these materials when they are synthesized under different temperature regimes.  This research draws on recent advances in the study of random processes."

Perhaps the most celebrated problem in this context is the derivation of the Hydrodynamic and kinetic equations from small scale dynamics governed by the Newton's second law. This problem is still wide open but some variants have been reaently treated. The investigator's research concerns the analysis of particle systems simulating a fluid or a dilute gas. Recently the investigator has derived the Boltzmann equation for the macroscopic particle densities for a class of one dimensional lattice gas models. Roughly speaking one shows that after a suitable scaling the microscopic particle density converges to a solution of the Boltzmann equation. The convergence is expected to be exponentially fast and the exponential rate can be expressed by a variational formula.      Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale? Roughly the reason is that the local conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy impose constraints not immediately visible on the microscopic scale. The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids and gases. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting particles is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of fluids and gases. Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient way of simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases."

Examples of problems that are to be investigated include the  stochastic models of the traveling salesman problem, the minimum  spanning tree problem, and several of  their related  approximations. The more specific objectives of the project  include (1) further development of the  distribution theory for  the traveling salesman problem and minimal spanning tree problem,  (2) more extensive development of Talagrand's theory of  configuration functions, (3) refined understanding of the tail  behavior of the increasing subsequence functional, and (4)  development of the basic limit theory for functionals associated  with non-optimal heuristics. The methods that will be used in  this investigation include Talagrand's isoperimetric theory,   Talagrand's theory of irregularity of distribution, the theory of  subadditive Euclidean functionals, the general efficiency theory  for statistical estimation, and  the theory of vector  quantization.  Each of these tools is of considerable importance  in its own right, and the expectation is that  useful insight  will be gained into the strengths and weaknesses of these tools  through the study of the concrete problems of  probabilistic  combinatorial optimization.     The interface of probability  theory and optimization has experienced remarkable growth over  the last five years, and this development has had substantial  impact on both theoretical computer science and the  practice of  algorithm development. The aim of this project is to build a  deeper understanding of the information and assistance that  probability can provide in some difficult and important problems  of computation. In particular, the project aims to develop  probability theory that helps describe the behavior of several  important quantities in the theory of combinatorial optimization,  a subj ect that studies the minimization and maximization of  functions that are defined very large finite sets. The more  specific objectives of the project include development of a  distribution theory for the length of the shortest path through a  large number of points whose locations are determined by a  probability distribution, and the  development of the basic  probability for some of the most  important approximation methods  of optimization theory."

In these models large systems of particles evolve statistically according to a simple local rule for which there are certain conserved quantities.  The goal is to show that on a macroscopic scale the conserved quantities evolve according to  deterministic conservation laws which usually take the form of nonlinear partial differential equations.  Of particular interest are the transport coefficients and how they arise from the microscopic dynamics, in particular in the nongradient models where there is a net effect of fluctuations.  Several types of nongradient models will be studied:  Models of disordered systems,  models of surfaces and interfaces, and lattice gas models for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.    A fundamental, and still largely open, problem is to understand how large systems of microscopic particles organize themselves to produce the collective macroscopic behavior we see in the world around us.  The investigator is pursuing this goal on models in which the microscopic dynamics has some degree of randomness.  The research includes models of transport in disordered media which come from condensed matter physics, models of surfaces and interfaces, and lattice gas models for incompressible fluid flow.  Besides providing a rigorous justification for the macroscopic conservation laws, other important consequences of these investigations are intrinsic formulas for transport coeffiaients, and precise estimates of the deviations of these microscopic systems from their macroscopic limits."

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) The use of percolation ideas to analyze the behavior of two-dimensional incompressible flows with random potentials. (2) The properties of a new random cluster model which, like the standard FK random cluster model, is closely related to the Ising model. (3) The use of percolation ideas to create a model, defined on a small scale, for large-scale phenomena which occur when water containing impurities freezes. (4) The geometry of finite clusters, and its relation to the cluster size distribution, for certain continuum models of percolation. (5) The interrelation between percolation behavior of the graph and other properties for the ""minimal spanning forest"" of a stationary random labeled graph. (6) The size of the fluctuations in the boundary of the region which can be reached by a fixed time in first-passage percolation. Additionally, Alexander will investigate a string-matching problem related to the reconstruction of DNA sequences from many short overlapping segments. This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand how small-scale randomness is reflected in large-scale, or ""macroscopic,"" properties of various systems in the natural world. A typical example is a piece of iron--each atom has a magnetic field aligned in a particular direction. These directions are random, but nearby atoms tend to align in approximately the same direction, particularly when the temperature is low. In essence, the tendency toward randomness, which increases with temperature, competes with the tendency to align. Clusters of atoms with similar alignments--all ""up,"", all ""down,"" etc.--are formed, and the random geometry of these clusters--what sizes of clusters occur with w hat probabilities--helps determine macroscopic properties of the iron. When the temperature goes below a certain precise ""critical point,"" there is a sudden change in the macroscopic behavior of the iron--the tendency to align wins out, so that a very large cluster of aligned atoms is formed, and the iron can become a magnet. Such ""critical phenomena""--sudden changes in macroscopic behavior when some measurement crosses a critical value--occur in a variety of contexts; recently, for example, there has been concern that the density of manmade junk orbiting the earth is approaching a critical level, above which the frequency of collisions will dramatically increase. Other systems in which small-scale randomness determines macroscopic properties, and critical phenomena may occur, include (i) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (ii) transport of heat by ocean currents in the presence of turbulence, which affects global climate; and (iii) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. Mathematicians and physicists have long understood that many aspects of the relation between small-scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems which Alexander will investigate are examples of such abstract systems."

In one dimension, classical simulated annealing can be modeled in continuous time as a certain diffusion process with drift. Given a function to be minimized, the drift term is the negative of the derivative of that function; and the infinitesimal variance, also called the rate of cooling, is inversely proportional to the logarithm of time. Under mild assumptions, it has been shown that such a diffusion converges in distribution to a random variable whose distribution is concentrated on the global minima of the function to be minimized. The investigator is studying the conjecture that if one uses a symmetric stable process in place of Brownian motion as the source of noise in the model, then one can cool at a rate proportional to time to a certain negative power, which is much faster than the logarithmic cooling required in the classical model. The genetic algorithm, as might be guessed from its name, is based on ideas from genetics. The investigator is investigating the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for the optimum partitioning problem. She is also comparing the performance of the genetic algorithm with deterministic algorithms. Optimization problems occur in almost every human endeavor. Businesses want to maximize profits and minimize cost. Many industrial robots are programmed so that the robot will accomplish its assigned task with a minimum amount of energy within a finite time period. This research studies ways to improve the performance of two widely-used computer-intensive algorithms for optimization: simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm. Simulated annealing has been used, for example, in computer-aided design of integrated circuits, in image processing, and in modeling the structure of proteins. As its name suggests, simulated annealing is an algorithm based on concepts from the physical process of annealing, where a substance is heated and then cooled slowly.. The genetic algorithm imitates the concept of ""survival of the fittest"" from Darwinian evolution."

The first mathematical problem concerns an integral mean inequality which would constitute a sharpening of a known lifetime result for Brownian motion in convex, simply connected planar domains normalized so that the largest disk they contain has radius one (or asymptotically one.) The second problem concerns a packing measure analysis of harmonic measure which would provide an analogue to the results of Makarov which relate a lower bound on the growth of the derivative of a univalent function to the proper Hausdorff measure function for the support of harmonic measure on the boundary of a domain. The education plan includes redesigning the senior/beginning graduate mathematical statistics courses to give the students a feeling for data and teaching a course for undergraduate mathematics majors by a modified Moore method, in order to give our undergraduates insight into the process of doing mathematical and statistical research. This award will fund both research in mathematics and course development in the mathematical sciences. During the award period, it is proposed to redesign an upper level statistics course to include work with actual data instead of focusing entirely on the mathematical theory behind statistics. There are also plans to teach a course for mathematics majors using self-discovery techniques in order to give undergraduates insight into the process of doing mathematical research. Two mathematical questions will be researched during the award period. One problem involves studying the pathological behavior of a certain class of mathematical functions. The techniques employed are related to those used for the study of fractals. The second pr oblem is derived from considering the lifetime of a particle moving randomly inside a region and dying when it touches the boundary of the region. Different regions allow the particle to live different lengths of time. Applications of this research are relevant in applied contexts, such as in studying stress on beams."

The investigators propose to explore a new distributional transformation, coined the ``zero bias transformation,'' and an associated new coupling that may be used in conjunction with Stein's method for obtaining bounds to the normal for sums of random variables having particular dependence structures. The new coupling can be used to shed light on certain questions where previous methods have yielded only an incomplete picture. In addition, when approximating the sum of symmetric dependent random variables, or those having vanishing third moment, the zero bias coupling is natural and promises to yield smaller bounds on the approximation error. The zero bias technique has numerous potential applications to cases of both local and global dependence, for instance, to nonlinear sampling and rank statistics. Moreover, the zero bias transformation may be defined for general random objects such as random measures and diffusions, with applications to Empirical Central Limit Theorems for dependent observations, and a process treatment of the Wald Wolfowitz theorem. The normal curve is used extensively in a variety of statistical applications, such as when sampling a large lot of goods for quality control, or in opinion polling. In real situations the normal curve is often only an idealization of something too difficult to compute. In the context of sampling, better accuracy of the normal approximation comes with larger sample sizes, but sampling is typically expensive or time consuming. Therefore, it is useful to have an idea of how well the normal curve approximates the true situation for small and realistic sample sizes. The normal curve approximation also appears in a variety of other, often more complex, statistical contexts. There exist a number of approaches for assessing the accuracy of the normal approximation, each best suited to a particular need. In adding to these techniques, the investigators are developing a new method which improves on those existing, for some situations. For instance, use of the new method, applied in the sampling context, would result in more reliable statistical conclusions drawn from realistic samples."
