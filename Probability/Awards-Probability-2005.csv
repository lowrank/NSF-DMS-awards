Several related  topics concerning self-avoiding walks, percolation, Ising and random cluster models, and stochastic dynamics of Ising models are proposed.  For the self-avoiding walk, the proposer hopes to answer some fundamental questions of the model on non-amenable graphs. Such questions include: (1) What is the average end-to-end distance of an N-step self-avoiding walk? (2) What is the asymptotic behavior of the number of N-step self-avoiding walks starting from a given point?  The topic in percolation concerns the critical behavior and critical exponents of the model on d-dimensional hyperbolic graphs, which are regular tessellations of the hyperbolic d-dimensional space.  The main project of Ising models on non-amenable graphs concerns problems which are of fundamental importance in physics literature. They  include: (1) How many extremal Gibbs states are there in different temperature region?  What are they? (2) How many translation-invariant Gibbs states are there and what are they?  Problems concerning stochastic dynamics of Ising models on various infinite graphs where spins evolve according to the usual Glauber dynamics are also proposed.<br/><br/>The proposed topics originate from and have a wide range of application in materials science, statistical physics, chemistry, biology and other fields of sciences.  The study of the self-avoiding walk arose in chemical physics as a model for long polymer chains.  It is the simplest mathematical model which characterizes the self-repulsion between monomers in a polymer chain, yet exhibits critical phenomena.  The interest in this model is, however, much broader since it is closely related to other stochastic models such as the Brownian motion and the newly discovered stochastic Loewner evolution.  Percolation is a probabilistic model of studying flow through a disordered system, such as particles flowing through the filter of a gas mask, or fluid seeping through the interstices of a random porous medium.  Ising models capture the basic magnetic properties of materials.  An important goal of this project is to understand how the geometry of the  space affects the nature of macroscopic behavior of these models.  The proposer will continue to make an effort to involve undergraduate students to undertake small pieces of the problems proposed here.  The proposal, if funded, will also support the students to present their findings in undergraduate research/education conferences.<br/>"

The first is to study the convergence properties of certain new finite dimensional geometric approximations to Wiener measure on a Riemannian manifold.  The second is to generalize the classical ""Skeleton"" and ""Taylor isomorphisms"" theorems to path and loop groups. The third is to find refinements to Malliavin's lifting method for deducing information about heat kernels and related Dirichlet forms.  The first two topics are motivated, in part, by the P.I.'s attempt to understand the important problem of quantizing Yang-Mills fields which form a key part of the ""standard model"" of particle physics. (See the Clay Mathematics Institute problem pertaining to quantized Yang-Mills fields for a description.)  The third topic is an attempt to extract useful information from the path integral representations for solutions to elliptic and hypoelliptic type heat equations.  The P.I. hopes to find new gradient inequalities for hypoelliptic diffusions by modifying the standard Bismut and Malliavin vector-field lifting techniques.<br/><br/>Since the 1940's, Feynman ""path integrals"" have played a central role in the description of quantum physics.  Although highly studied, the mathematical footing of path integrals in many contexts is still tenuous at best.  Much of this proposal is devoted to the mathematics of path integrals which in turn may impact our understanding of the description of elementary particles.  The problems to be addressed are aimed at giving mathematically precise meaning to the heuristic expressions and <br/>computations which are used by physicists in the description of elementary particles.  Besides being of foundational importance, this project should shed light on the ""anomalies"" which can appear in the quantization process, i.e. the process of going from a classical mechanical description to a quantum mechanical description of a physical system.  It is also proposed to develop new methods for extracting useful information about the flow of heat in complicated geometrical bodies using the diffusion interpretation of this phenomenon.  This proposal has a significant graduate training component as a number of the problems will be tackled by the P.I.'s students.<br/>"

Thus it can be and has recently been applied to describe phenomena that cannot be described by these two major stochastic processes. To enlarge the scope of application one needs to study the nonlinear  functionals of fractional Brownian motion.  An important and  natural class of such functionals are those given by stochastic differential equations. In addition to studying self-intersection local time, the principal investigator proposes to study general stochastic  differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion.  The  difficulty in such study is caused by the fact that the powerful Picard's iteration approach fails to work.  The principal investigator proposes to combine fractional calculus, anticipative stochastic calculus, and the characteristic theory to investigate such equations.<br/><br/>To describe natural or social phenomena mathematically, people usually use Markov property (the future depends only on today although the whole history until today is known). This is a reasonable simplification, particularly if one considers the sophistication needed to deal with the entire past. However, it becomes more and more demanding to assimilate all the information available to better predict the future.  Fractional Brownian motion is among the simplest statistical model that captures this long memory character.  It has found many applications. To more adequately fit mathematical models to the phenomena under consideration, one should use  fractional Brownian motion as building blocks to obtain more sophisticated random quantities. The principal investigator has focused on this statistical model for a number of years and has achieved significant success. This research will considerably further this progress and is expected to have impact on many other fields. Immediate applications are to be found in finance and bio-informatics.<br/>"

The first problem concerns the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern<br/>theorem. The investigator has proved a generalization of this theorem valid<br/>for an oriented even-dimensional Riemannian vector bundle over a closed<br/>compact manifold, equipped with a metric connection. The investigator would<br/>like to simplify his proof, replacing the use of the Splitting Principle,<br/>which constitutes a key step in his argument, with a more elementary and<br/>transparent stochastic argument. The second problem concerns the derivation<br/>of integration by parts formulae for the law of a diffusion process on a<br/>compact manifold. The investigator has recently found a new method for<br/>obtaining integration by parts formulae in the case where the diffusion is<br/>strictly elliptic. He plans to use his method to study the analogous problem<br/>for degenerate (non-elliptic) diffusions.  He believes he will be able to<br/>prove a dichotomy theorem giving conditions very close to necessary and<br/>sufficient for the existence of integration by parts formulae, for a large<br/>class of vector fields in the degenerate case.   In the third problem, the<br/>investigator in collaboration with Elton Hsu, will use ideas in two papers<br/>of Hsu to give a simplified stochastic proof of the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern<br/>theorem for manifolds with boundary.

Both<br/>areas have close connections with the physical world. For example,<br/>stochastic differential equations, a central theme of the proposal, are<br/>widely used to model physical systems subject to the influence of random<br/>noise.  Examples include the flow of heat in a material, weather systems,<br/>the trajectory of a spacecraft, and the pricing of stock options. Curved<br/>spaces are often the natural setting for these phenomena, e.g. if one wishes<br/>to study the heat at various points on a cylindrical pipe. A deeper<br/>understanding of the mathematics underlying physical systems is often<br/>crucial in developing good mathematical models of these systems. Thus,<br/>although it is of a theoretical nature, the research outlined in this<br/>proposal may prove useful in many areas of applied science and technology.<br/>"

More precisely, one looks at random walks on the <br/>d-dimensional lattice, whose transition probabilities form a random field <br/>indexed by the vertices of the lattice. Not only is the RWRE providing a <br/>serious mathematical challenge, many of the results proved in this field, <br/>especially in the one dimensional case, stand in sharp contrast with the <br/>behavior of classical random walk. For example, in dimension 1, <br/>subdiffusive behavior and aging phenomena are present, whereas in high <br/>dimension one may construct RWRE's with nonzero (averaged) local drift <br/>pointing in one direction while the walk drifts away (with positive speed) <br/>in the opposite direction. Some of the mathematical challenge emanates <br/>from the fact that in the multidimensional case, conditioned on the <br/>transition probabilities random field, the RWRE is not reversible. This <br/>precludes the use of much of the available theory of homogenization, and <br/>requires the development of new techniques, most notably through the use <br/>of regeneration times and of renormalization ideas. In spite of rapid <br/>progress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers <br/>including Bolthausen, Sznitman, Varadhan, Zerner, and the PI, many <br/>fundamental questions remain unanswered. Among these one notes the <br/>existence of 0-1 laws, laws of large numbers in full generality, <br/>transience and recurrence criteria, the relation between quenched and <br/>annealed large deviations behavior, the existence (or non-existence) of <br/>sub-diffusive behavior for high dimension, and the behavior of RWRE's in <br/>mixing (as opposed to i.i.d.) environments.<br/><br/><br/>Random walks are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by <br/>mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as <br/>diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. <br/>Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at <br/>all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a <br/>random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). <br/>Such RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media <br/>in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing <br/>because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the <br/>other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are <br/>not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is <br/>to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow to make <br/>provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that <br/>such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link <br/>naturally to the study of trapping models and reinforced random walks. <br/>While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have <br/>recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and <br/>RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of <br/>contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical <br/>background and tools are in place.<br/>"

A principal goal of research in this area is to understand how the macroscopic behavior of large systems depends on the individual interactions between components.  Two competition models will be studied, a spatial stochastic Lotka-Volterra model and a multitype contact process.

In the former, a particle is driven by its interaction with the non-homogeneous random medium, while in the latter, the particle interacts with other particles present. In the general RWRE model an environment is a collection of transition probabilities between lattice sites, and it is chosen from some mixing shift-invariant distribution. On the other hand, a class of deposition models, introduced by the first PI, not only provides a unified framework for many well-known particle systems, but also gives a broader view on common phenomena arising in such systems. An object of vital importance in particle systems, in spirit similar to a random walker in random environment, is the so-called second class particle. The main goal of these fields is the understanding of the consequences of the randomness in the environment, or caused by particle-particle interactions, respectively. Among the fundamental questions one can consider are the existence of 0-1 laws, law of large numbers, central limit theorems, large deviations, etc. The two fields are very close in spirit and ideas, just as an example, non-reversibility is a major obstacle in both fields to common applications. Sometimes even direct connections can be established between the two fields through different representations of the same system. This research contains an instance where a surface growth process is shown to be the dual of a RWRE model, allowing the flow of results from the latter to the former. Dual connections within the field of interacting systems are known to be a powerful tool.  Analogously, drawing parallels between interacting systems and RWRE's allows for the exchange of methods, insights, and results.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that probabilistic intuition and techniques are often of great relevance to other areas of mathematics, this research has a direct impact on probability theory, combinatorics, statistical physics, and the theory of partial differential equations. The fields of random media and interacting systems also have various industrial, agricultural, sociological, and biological applications. Moreover the methods and problems in these fields are often easy to state, while the solutions involve sophisticated tools. This makes the subject appealing to graduate students and young researchers, generating more interest in probability theory.<br/>"

A coalescent model in which new<br/>particles appear at rate one and clusters merge at a rate<br/>proportional to the product of the masses has previously<br/>been studied, but a qualitatively different phase<br/>transition is conjectured to arise in an alternative<br/>model in which clusters merge at a rate proportional to<br/>the sum of the masses.<br/><br/>Stochastic models of coalescence have a wide range of<br/>applications in other fields of science such as biology,<br/>physical chemistry, and astronomy.

It<br/>should be possible to use the mathematical theory of<br/>coalescence to gain further insight into how beneficial<br/>mutations impact this process.  The project of determining<br/>the amount of time for one individual in a population to<br/>experience several mutations is motivated by simple models<br/>of cancer, in which it is assumed that a cell becomes<br/>cancerous only after several harmful mutations take place.<br/>The study of coalescent processes in which the mass of the<br/>system increases over time is motivated by recent interest<br/>in randomly growing networks.<br/>"

The inclusion of random effects can serve a number of distinct purposes. On one hand, randomness can be used to compensate for elements of a system not fully modeled or for insufficiently resolved scales in the system. This research proposal concentrates on the analysis of how randomness spreads through large dimensional, extended dynamical systems.  One of the central questions is how passing through many nonlinear interactions or scales shapes the randomness. Stochastically forced partial differential equations (SPDEs) such as stochastic fluid equations or stochastically forced reaction diffusion equations will be a focus of the proposed work. These systems are often agitated at one scale and it is of both mathematical and modeling interest to understand the effect of this agitation at other scales. In particular, this proposal hopes to shed light on the transfer of randomness between different scales in turbulent fluid flow. In addition to SPDEs, the proposal will study related questions in large chemical networks arising in cell regulation and nutrient flow in forest environments. The emphasis will be on the pathwise dynamics, novel stochastic numerical methods, and estimation problems.<br/><br/>Quantifying and modeling uncertainty is increasingly important in our attempts to understand and predict our complex and changing world.  From the financial markets, to weather prediction, to environmental engendering, to neuroscience, to aeronautics, models including random influences have become central to the physical sciences, to the social sciences and to engineering.  Of particular significance is understanding how pure randomness is shaped into the structures we observe, especially when the randomness is transferred across disparate spatial scales. This understanding is the key to producing effective models with which to predict complex real systems. This proposal specifically addresses questions central to turbulent water flow and complicated biochemical pathways in cells. More broadly, applied mathematicians are on the leading edge of<br/>our scientific and technological future.  Because of their broad training, they are the best equipped to move into new, non-traditional fields as they appear, build the bridges between classical disciplines, and disseminate the understanding gained in purer mathematical studies to larger scientific and social endeavors. America's leadership in science and technology requires us<br/>to continue producing world-class researchers and students in applied mathematics. This proposal includes an undergraduate research component to encourage interested students to choose a science-related career. It includes outreach to local high schools to expose students at an earlier age to modern mathematics and the myriad of career possibilities it presents.<br/>"

More<br/>        precisely, there are five specific problems of interest the<br/>        investigator would like to solve. The first problem is to use<br/>        Stein's method to prove approximations to the Tracy-Widom<br/>        distribution (whose merit lies in its applications to random<br/>        matrix theory, tiling problems, percolation, queuing theory,<br/>        and much else). The second problem is to continue the<br/>        investigator's work on Stein's method and the spectrum of<br/>        random walks. The third problem is to use Stein's method to<br/>        prove approximations to the semicircle distribution (the free<br/>        probability analog of the normal distribution). The fourth<br/>        problem is to use Stein's method to bound convergence rates of<br/>        Markov chains, building on ideas of Diaconis. The fifth problem is<br/>        to prove chi-squared approximation for contingency tables with<br/>        fixed row and column sums, which would be quite valuable because<br/>        such approximations are frequently used in statistical work even<br/> though their accuracy is poorly understood.<br/><br/>  In making decisions of public policy, it is important<br/>        that one draws correct conclusions from the data available. A<br/>        drawback to many of the statistical methods applied today is that<br/>        the accuracy of the conclusions is unclear. As one example, in<br/>        determining whether there is gender bias in the promotion of<br/>        employees, it is common to use a statistical test called the<br/>        chi-squared test. As a second example, work on DNA sequences of<br/>        interest to biotechnology and health uses Poisson approximations<br/>        from probability theory. As a third example, in physics and<br/>        chemistry one uses Markov chain methods to test theoretical<br/>        models. These methods are routinely applied so it is important to<br/>        quantify their validity. A remarkable technique, introduced by Charles<br/>        Stein at Stanford, offers hope of better quantifying the accuracy<br/>        of such procedures. Stein's method has proven successful in<br/>        applications to DNA sequencing, but the technique is largely<br/>        unexplored. The investigator plans to extend the scope and<br/>        applicability of this method. As a final goal, the investigator<br/>        plans to study the use of Stein's method in Markov chain theory,<br/>        which as mentioned above, is crucial to drawing reliable<br/>        conclusions from computer simulations.<br/><br/>"

This research centers on developing Gaussian methods for the study of both typical behaviors and rare events of the type that positive random quantities take smaller values.  The major objective is to extend the understanding of related topics and build a general theory based on systematic study of various techniques and applications.  The isoperimetric type Gaussian inequalities provide comparisons between dependent (complected) structure and independent (simpler) one which becomes an equality in certain (possibility limiting) cases. They have been used as basic tools in various problems and played a crucial role in deeper understanding of random phenomenon. The recent development of several new techniques for Gaussian and closely related random processes broadened our understanding of small deviation probabilities and their connections with related topics of probability such as Gaussian random matrices, non-intersection exponents and random assignments.  In turn, it suggests many further questions connected to applications in probability theory and geometric functional analysis. The very successful applications to lower tail probabilities, the Brownian pursuit models and the first exit times will be expanded to a detailed study of real zeros of random polynomials and Gaussian chaos.<br/><br/>This research has a broader impact on diverse areas of probability, which is both a fundamental way of viewing the world and a core mathematical discipline.

The particular functionals of the<br/>empirical distribution that he plans to investigate include statistics and<br/>estimators based on distance measures such as the empirical Hellinger distance<br/>and a class of integral functionals of density estimators, which are used to<br/>estimate entropy and the integral of the squared density and its derivative.<br/>This will likely lead to the development of a theory of local U-statistics<br/>processes.

In the former, a particle is driven by its interaction with the non-homogeneous random medium, while in the latter, the particle interacts with other particles present. In the general RWRE model an environment is a collection of transition probabilities between lattice sites, and it is chosen from some mixing shift-invariant distribution. On the other hand, a class of deposition models, introduced by the first PI, not only provides a unified framework for many well-known particle systems, but also gives a broader view on common phenomena arising in such systems. An object of vital importance in particle systems, in spirit similar to a random walker in random environment, is the so-called second class particle. The main goal of these fields is the understanding of the consequences of the randomness in the environment, or caused by particle-particle interactions, respectively. Among the fundamental questions one can consider are the existence of 0-1 laws, law of large numbers, central limit theorems, large deviations, etc. The two fields are very close in spirit and ideas, just as an example, non-reversibility is a major obstacle in both fields to common applications. Sometimes even direct connections can be established between the two fields through different representations of the same system. This research contains an instance where a surface growth process is shown to be the dual of a RWRE model, allowing the flow of results from the latter to the former. Dual connections within the field of interacting systems are known to be a powerful tool.  Analogously, drawing parallels between interacting systems and RWRE's allows for the exchange of methods, insights, and results.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that probabilistic intuition and techniques are often of great relevance to other areas of mathematics, this research has a direct impact on probability theory, combinatorics, statistical physics, and the theory of partial differential equations. The fields of random media and interacting systems also have various industrial, agricultural, sociological, and biological applications. Moreover the methods and problems in these fields are often easy to state, while the solutions involve sophisticated tools. This makes the subject appealing to graduate students and young researchers, generating more interest in probability theory.<br/>"

In the kinetic limit, the phase space distribution of a solution to this equation converges to a linear Boltzmann equation. Beyond the kinetic scale, one expects that the Boltzmann equation is still correct in dimension three or higher provided that the diffusivity is renormalized. The first project aims to study this renormalization for time scales longer than the kinetic scale. The second project concerns the viscosity of the lattice gas models. Recently the PI has established the divergence rate for the diffusion coefficient for the asymmetric simple exclusion process in dimension two. The goal of this project is to extend this result to the dimension one case and to the lattice gas models with the Navier-Stokes equation as the formal limit. <br/> The fundamental question regarding the conductivity of electrons in semiconductors is how conduction occurs. As the technology is reaching the stage that the semi-classical theory no longer applies, the quantum effect will dominate and a mathematical rigorous theory is of fundamental importance. The first project aims to establish the quantum corrections of the standard semi-classical theory based on the Boltzmann equation. This will provide the first rigorous understanding of these quantum dynamical effects. The second project investigates the validity of the lattice gas models for fluids. These models, besides being widely used to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations, are important models for non-equilibrium statistical physics. The goal here is to establish the divergence rate of the viscosity for these models. This will give the first clue concerning how well the Navier-Stokes equation models the two-dimensional fluid. <br/>"

To get an estimate on the lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the SLE boundary, the asymptotic behavior of normalized (pre-)Schwarzian derivatives for the SLE backward flows is employed. The normalized (pre-)Schwarzian derivatives of SLE maps with higher order terms are continuous square integrable martingales with second moment obeying the Duplantier duality and they have correlations that decay exponentially in the hyperbolic distance. This method allows one to make a formal argument for a lower bound. Makarov's law of iterated logarithm makes it possible to compare harmonic measure to a Hausdorff measure associated with a logarithmico-exponential function. The goal of this project is to get the exact estimate for Makarov's law of iterated logarithm for SLE and compare harmonic measure to a Hausdorff measure with a best possible measure function.<br/><br/>Since Stochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE) was introduced by Schramm, a lot of works have been done in this area by mathematicians and physicists in various areas like mathematical physics, probability theory and complex analysis. For example, SLE(6) was used to prove Mandelbrot's conjecture that the outer boundary of a planar Brownian path should have fractal dimension 4/3.  On the other hand, several lattice models from statistical physics have been shown or conjectured to correspond to some SLE's. This project provides mathematical analysis for physicists' predictions like Duplantier's duality conjecture, which is derived by arguments from conformal field theory. It may also build up the methods to approach their mathematical proofs.<br/>"

In particular he investigates the problem called small deviations. The PI is also working on extreme value theory for Gaussian random fields motivated by an application to nonparametric statistics. The problem of small deviations is related to the behavior of the probability that a stochastic process stays in a small neighborhood of the origin. As the neighborhood shrinks, this probability clearly tends to zero --- the question is at what rate? The PI calculates this rate for various processes, including the storage process that is used to model the amount of water available in a dam. Motivation of the other problem comes from nonparametric statistics. One of the main problem in modern nonparametric smoothing is concerned with finding the best smooth curve approximating the data. Chaudhuri & Marron (1999) proposed a tool for data exploration called SiZer. The visual display of SiZer, can be viewed as a summary of a large number (hundreds) of hypothesis test results. For reasonable statistical inference, care needs to be taken about the multiple comparison issue. The current implementations of SiZer is not addressing the issue of multiple testing adequately. To correct this one needs to study the distribution of the maximum of a particular discrete nonstationary Gaussian random field. <br/><br/>The PI works on two major problems, small deviations for stochastic processes and extreme value theory for a particular random field. The area of small deviations is relatively new with major developments starting in the 1990's. The solution of the small deviation problems helps us understand the nature of certain rare events when the variability of a random process is much less then expected. Applications of this theory are currently pursued by many researchers. The investigator develops a new application of small deviation techniques in storage theory. The proposed extreme value problem is directly motivated by a statistical application. It aims at improving the performance of the data analysis tool SiZer. SiZer is currently widely used by many applied scientists. Successful applications of SiZer include internet traffic modeling, climatology and environment, and biology and genetics. Part of this proposal aims at significantly improving the SiZer tool to make it more reliable for applications. <br/><br/><br/>"

Altogether ten specific projects are proposed which can be grouped into four categories. The first category deals with problems of first-order phase transitions. Here the specific objects of study include proofs of phase transitions by comparison to mean-field theory, influence of dilution on symmetry breaking in antiferromagnets, and various effects accompanying phase transitions in systems with continuous spins. The second category is focused on droplet and interface phenomena. The corresponding projects include a study of relaxation to equilibrium in solvent-solute systems and the mesoscopic concept of pressure in systems at phase coexistence. The third category of projects deals with problems related to conformal invariance in 2D critical models. Here the fractal properties of the so-called SLE boundaries will be investigated and a model of random fractal trees will be analyzed. The final category involves problems of small-world phenomena. The specific problem of interest here is the growth of the graph distance in a critical model of Euclidean-based random graphs.<br/><br/>On a broader level, the proposal hopes to address a series of questions that all have their origin in physics, chemistry, engineering and/or social sciences. A particular attention will be paid to the phenomena of phase transitions in which the overall character of the system undergoes a sudden, and often rather drastic, change while the external conditions vary smoothly through a particular, transitional, value.  Examples of such transitions are ample in physical sciences (e.g., freezing or melting in physical chemistry) and engineering (e.g., jams in internet traffic); but they also have their natural counterparts in social sciences (e.g., opinion spreading in social networks). Much of this proposal is spent on studying very specific mathematical problems of these types. For instance, one of the proposed projects deals with the appearance of magnetism in transition-metal compounds, another offers to shed some light on the theoretical aspects of brine-pocket formation in the sea ice, yet another project is devoted to the ""degree of separation"" of two individuals (or computer servers) in a thinly connected (communication) network. The common ground of several of these problems is the need of proper mathematical tools for their successful resolution. One of the goals of the present proposal is to develop such tools and disseminate their main ideas to the scientific community at large.<br/><br/>"

Some fundamental problems in this field were solved during the last three years which opens new directions of research.  These directions will be explored.  In particular, new probabilistic tools will be applied to problems on nonlinear differential equations.

Attention will be paid to the development of stochastic bifurcation theory, namely the study of the qualitative changes in long term behavior which can occur when one or more parameters in the stochastic differential equation are varied. Typically bifurcation occurs when a Lyapunov exponent changes sign. Stochastic averaging methods will be developed to calculate Lyapunov exponents, and rigorous results will relate the behavior of the linearized process to that of the underlying nonlinear system. The concepts of random sinks (depending on the past) and random sources (depending on the future) will be studied. The random sinks and sources may be single points, or sets of some (non-integer) Hausdorff dimension. A phase portrait for a random dynamical system will then consist of a mixture of past and future information. Two physical models will be studied in detail: the stability of the vibrations of a flexible beam under stochastic forcing, and the effects of noise on the phase-locking and bifurcation behavior of the leaky integrate-and-fire oscillators which occur as models of neural activity.<br/><br/>The project will study mathematical models used to describe the behavior of certain physical systems as they evolve in time under the influence of random perturbations.

Particular attention will be paid to descriptions of the long term behavior of such systems, and in particular to situations where a gradual change in some underlying constants can cause a sudden change in the long term behavior of the system. The project will develop a general theory for such systems. It will also study in detail two special cases: the vibrations of a thin flexible beam, and the integrate-and-fire model for activity within a single neuron in the brain."
