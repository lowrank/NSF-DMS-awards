The investigator uses these systems to model several biological phenomena. Many of these models have already been considered in  the mathematical biology and physics literature but very few rigorous results have been proved. So far most of the mathematical theory about interacting particle systems deals with monotone (or attractive) systems. When one deals with epidemics, monotonicity does not hold. To prove results for non-monotone systems is crucial since so many phenomena in our world are not monotone in any (mathematically ) useful way.   Interacting particle systems are very useful in studying epidemics. For instance, The investigator proposes the following model for the spread of an  epidemic. There is a grid of sites and each site is either empty, healthy or infected. Healthy and infected individuals give birth to healthy individuals on empty nearest neighbor sites. Healthy individuals get infected by infected nearest neighbors. Healthy and infected individuals die at different rates. This seems adequate for epidemics like the AIDS epidemic for which infected individuals may give birth to healthy individuals. One of the results proved by The investigator is that, given an infection rate which is large enough, the epidemic will persist if and only if the rate at which infected individuals give birth is high enough. While the model considered is a gross simplification of the real world it does give an interesting idea to test. Namely, is it true that the countries where the AIDS epidemic is the most devastating are the countries where the rate at which infected individuals give birth is the highest?"

The proposed research is related to several areas of probability theory:  the theory of Dirichlet forms and Markov processes, weak convergence theory, stochastic calculus and martingale theory. The investigator is mainly interested in the following problems:    1) Time-dependent Dirichlet form and moving boundary problems;    2) The analysis of the Markov chain models which give approximating solutions for the above problems;     3) The estimate of the rate of weak convergence when a sequence of Markov chains approach a diffusion process. The investigator expects that this proposed study will introduce more applications of the existing results of diffusion process theory thereby enriching the whole theory.      The main purpose of this investigation is to study problems related to the temperature evolution of an object composed of several different materials. Two examples are the melting-freezing process of ice hills on the oceans and temperature control inside a nuclear reactor. For those problems, the real computations are very complicated and sometimes applied scientists do not even know if their computational result is precise enough to the applicable to the real world.  The investigator will use a special mathematical model known as ""diffusion processes"" to simulate the real temperature evolution on those objects. Moreover, the investigator  will study how to realize this process on a computer and how accurate the computer simulation result will be."

The project on U-statistics and  processes follows up on fairly recent work of this investigator,  J. Cuzick and E. Gine as well as some work of Anda Gadidov (who  has just obtained her Ph.D. under the direction of this  investigator). The project on correlation inequalities work has  been under way for some time and several results have already  been obtained. In particular, Schechtman, Schlumprecht and this  investigator obtained the desired inequality for ellipsoids.  The  third project follows up on a recently submitted paper (with  Hitczenko, Kwapien, Li, Schechtman, Schlumprecht) on  hypercontractivity of alternating maxima and minima of  multi-indexed independent, identically distributed random  variables.    Classical empirical processes can and have been  used by statisticians to obtain information about basic  characteristicq of a ``population'' using samples collected from  the population. The modern theory, developed over the last twenty  or so years, allows one to study many such characteristics  simultaneously  A component of both the classical and modern  theory studied by this investigator is U-processes, which are, in  a sense, building blocks for general statistical functionals.   Such investigations will help to better assess the accuracy of  statistical procedures currently used in the study of censored  and/or truncated data in Medicine, Astronomy and other fields.  The modern theory of empirical processes has also made  connections with another field of probability, namely, the study  of Gaussian processes. Inequalities for such processes have  played a major role not only in probability--as well as many  other fields of mathematics, such as harmonic analysis, Banach  space theory and, more recently, operator theory--but also in  Theoretical Physics (Quant um field theory).  The Gaussian  Correlation Conjecture is one such outstanding problem in this  area. Many correlation results in, for example, statistical  mechanics, attack one-sided problems. This particular conjecture  attacks a two-sided barrier problem. One hoped for by-product of  a solution to this problem is to other two-sided problems present  in a variety of fields. One of the approaches to this problem,  led to the third project under study by this investigator,  namely, hypercontractivity. In our context hypercontractivity  allows one to change the original formulation of the problem, to  a problem more amenable to some recent advances in the theory of  inequalities for Gaussian processes.."

In the first area, the objective is to further develop the technique based on quasiderivatives mf solutions of Ito's equations and apply it for processes considered up to the first exit time from a domain.  In the second area, it is to investigate smoothness of solutions of SPDEs arising in filtering problems and population genetics in order to be able to guarantee certain rates of convergence of approximations to their solutions. In the third area, the aim is to get  estimates of the rate of convergence.    The project relates to investigations of probabilistic behavior of certain objects. Part 1 is aimed at better understanding of averaged quantities and is thought of as been important for parts 2 and 3. Part 2 aims at problems directly related to many practical issues such as image reconstruction or high-performance.  It is also vital in dealing with problems like evolution of bacteria populations, which may be important in biotechnology. Part 3 deals with problems of optimal control of random processes which arise, for instance, in finance."

This construction, motivated by a purely probabilistic approach to the problem, has the potential to achieve the best possible overall rate of such approximations. In statistics, the investigator studies three different and unrelated groups of problems. One of these is concerned with the overall asymptotic normality, at the best possible rate of convergence, of certain least squares estimators for the exponent of a regularly varying tail of a distribution function, by means of the quantile-transformation method. The second is the exploration of universal large-sample Gaussian approximations to cumulative-hazard and product-limit processes under random censorship without any conditions on the estimated distribution or the censoring mechanism, where the investigator uses a combination of strong-approximation and martingale-theoretic analyses. The third group of problems is concerned with rounding off a recent theory of nonparametric curve estimation under short- and long-range dependent Gaussian subordination by answering the outstanding questions for random-design regression.   The investigator's Probability project studies an approximation to sums of independent observations, which, unlike the usual approximations in terms of bell-shaped curves-- responsible only for the middle portions of the data -- attempts to incorporate the effects of the extremes as well. In Statistics, the investigator is studying three different groups of problems. The first one is concerned with the robust estimation of measures of ""thickness of the tails"" of data sets. This problem is important in various applied statistical and actuarial situations, such as the assessment of the variability of stock-price changes and the distribution of large claims in insuran ce business, particularly in bankruptcy re-insurance. The second group of statistical problems is to investigate the basic large-sample behavior of estimation when the observed data are incomplete due to the presence of nuisance effects and/or the necessity of an early termination of data collection; situations commonly referred to as random censorship. Here the investigator's anticipated results aim at greatly stretching the limits of concrete applicability of statistical estimation techniques for survival analyses with randomly censored data. These are of great interest in medical follow-up studies and reliability engineering. In the third group of problems in Statistics, the investigator extends his recent theory to cover all major curve-estimation patterns (density estimation, fixed-design and random-design regression) with long-memory data sets. The complete theory will explore the basic distributional properties of commonly used curve-estimation methods in time series analysis when the observations may be long-range dependent, as in many typical applied problems in geophysics and hydrology."

The investigator applies modern approximation and Markov chain techniques to the study of random tree models. The work focuses on exploring the applicability of Chen-Stein techniques for Poisson approximation to obtain distributional results for functionals of random trees. The project also addresses the analysis of self-organizing random trees and the efficacy of using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to generate near-random search trees.  The project has significance for the design and analysis of algorithms, particularly in computer science. Tree models also arise in statistics, physics, chemistry, sociology, and numerous other scientific areas. A first line of investigation into the behavior of such trees is to consider how a ``typical'' tree behaves. Thus a random model is postulated and characteristics of the ``random tree'' are studied. The methods that the investigator considers have previously been applied with success in several other areas of  probability and statistics."

The straightforward way to analyze a position is to examine all of its options and all the options of these options and all the options of the options of these options and all the.... The obvious difficulty is that this exhausting search through the game-tree takes an enormous amount of time even for very simple games (exponential running time in terms of the board-size). Note that the game-matrix approach, the set-up of traditional game theory, is much worse: usually requiring double exponential time. A desperate attempt to make up for the lack  of time is to study the random walk on the game-tree. Now the basic idea of the probabilistic theory of the investigator is that  the probabilistic analysis of the random walk (i.e. the random game)  is often a tractable problem, and also what one has learned from this analysis can often be converted, via potential arguments (like resource counting with loss-probabilities), into deterministic optimal strategies. The probabilistic theory is basically a game-theoretic  adaptation of the so-called Probabilistic Method in Combinatorics  applied to hopelessly complicated games where algebraic and other exact methods fail to work. The surprising thing is that this desperate attempt turns out to be very successful for large, interesting classes of positional games. The main chapters of the proposal are: the foundations of positional games (a surprisingly non-trivial task), game-theoretic Ramsey theory, game-theoretic random graph theory, game-theoretic Lovasz Local Lemma, and applications in algorithms and complexity.  Traditional game theory, i.e. von Neumann's theory, is basically the theory of games of incomplete information. It provides good insights to Economics, and many areas of social science (Management, Military Strategy, etc.). Similarly, one can expect many new applications from a successfu l theory of games of complete information (i.e. positional games). This is exactly what the investigator's proposal is all about. An extremely exciting aspect of studying positional games is that it might give a better understanding of how human intelligence works. It might have some impact on fundamental questions like whether human understanding is a computational or a non-computational process. Note that in Japan there are several ""perfect"" players who, when playing first, can consistently win Go-Moku (5-in-a-row on the 19 by 19 Go board), but nobody can turn these heuristics into precise arguments. Similarly, 6-in-a-row on a sufficiently large board between two reasonably good players is always a boring draw-game, but again we cannot precisely explain why. Or what is the reason that Go-playing computer programs are nowhere close to the best human players? These are just three of many examples where the human mind ""knows"" something beyond rigorous mathematics. One more thing: in contrast to Go, the best Chess-playing computer programs have now reached the level of human Grandmasters. But there is a basic difference. Computer programs examine millions of positions before deciding what to do next. On the other hand, even the best Grandmasters do not search more than 100 positions per move. In human Chess, pattern recognition plays a more important role than search. How to supply this human knowledge to a computer is a puzzle that no one has solved yet. Beside its theoretical importance, the investigator's project could be a crucial step toward the solution of these questions, too."

One of the objects to study, which will be a useful tool in many directions, is the affine connection associated to a stochastic differential equation. This connection provides the geometrical structure to obtain good estimates for the derivative flow of stochastic differential equations.  Those structures arising from degenerate systems are particularly investigated: there are problems of definition and of the existence of singularities. Although the main work is on finite  dimensional systems infinite dimensional ones are also considered. Bismut type  formulae and integration by  parts formulae on path spaces connected to the above are also examined. On a more directly geometrical level the concepts of spectral positivity for curvatures are considered together with its consequences for the geometry of the manifold.   Stochastic flows are typically solutions of stochastic differential equations (equations perturbed by white noise). Properties of  stochastic flows including the stability and  invariance are particularly interesting when considered together with the geometry of the  underlying spaces.  The techniques described in the proposal are used to study nonlinear equations including the blow ups and regularities of the solutions. The investigator also examines properties of local martingales, which finds its applications in mathematical finance."

Due in large part to the recent explosion of DNA  sequence data, two significant trends have emerged in population genetics over the past 20 years.  Firstly, the theory now focuses on sampling distributions  and the inferences that can be drawn from them.  Secondly, the retrospective  view (often referred to as coalescent theory) replaced the former prospective view.  By studying ancestry, much of the unnecessary structure is stripped away and simple flexible models emerge.  Coalescent theory has had much success in analyzing neutral models (i.e., models with no selection); however, the corresponding selective theory has, for the most part, remained out of reach.  Recent progress by one of the PI's has opened up many avenues of research on biologically relevant problems.  It is shown that genealogical information is embedded in the dual processes of certain interacting particle systems.  The investigators propose to extend these techniques to include a variety of models, most notably models involving DNA polymorphism and recombination.  Sampling theory for models with selection will also be developed.  The sampling theory for a large class of models is characterized and is analogous to the exponential family.  Thus the theory of inference, including parameter estimation, information criteria, hypothesis testing, and model selection will be developed rigorously.  Interacting particle systems are ideal for modeling biological systems with spatial structure.  In recent years, tools have been developed for dealing with multitype particle systems. These multitype systems are particularly relevant in ecological models.  A number of multitype models of competition and succession are proposed.  Some of the key features in the proposed model s are the effects of different dispersal ranges and random environments.  The problems in this proposal are motivated by important issues in population genetics and ecology.  Mathematical models are useful for several reasons.  The time scales of interest in many biological settings are often hundreds or thousands of years (e.g., forest succession, evolutionary changes, etc.), and hence it is important to be able to predict long-term effects when certain characteristics of the population are changed.  Another example of a timely issue which precludes a ""wait and see"" approach is the extinction of endangered species.  The models and analysis proposed will allow for qualitative and quantitative predictions, as well as efficient simulation strategies.  Significant contributions to the mathematical underpinnings of these models are also expected.  The proposed work on population genetics will address the effects of natural selection on genealogy.  This is crucial for developing efficient tests for selection, determining how powerful these tests are, deciding which selective models are realistic and what their properties are.  Spatial models in ecology will be approached through ""interacting particle systems.""  Issues such as the spread and control of disease in plant communities, extinction of populations in subdivided habitats, and the effects of inhomogeneous environments will be addressed.  The models proposed are much more complicated than most models in the literature because they take into account the spatial structure that is inherent (and important) in real populations."

Particular attention will  be paid to behaviors that cannot occur in Euclidean state spaces,  such as exponential population growth with eventual extinction in  every compact subset.  Related problems regarding the mixing rate  for various finite state Markov chains will also be investigated,  with the immediate aim of contributing to the understanding of  the so-called ""cutoff phenomenon"".    Random growth processes serve as crude models of population  growth in structured environments, and thus are of natural  interest in population biology.  They are also important as  models in various areas of theoretical physics, in particular,  statistical mechanics.  Problems concerning  mixing rates of   finite-state Markov chains are of practical importance because of  the increasing use of ""Markov chain Monte Carlo"" methods in  simulation studies.  ***"

One problem is to come up with a coupling for diffusions with degenerate generators given by sums of squares of vector which satisfy Hormander's hypoellipticity condition. A related problem is to give a coupling proof of Moser's Harnack inequality. The principal investigator also uses coupling techniques on Brownian motion on Gromov hyperbolic spaces to estimate eigenvalues and gradients of harmonic functions. The principal investigator also studies relativistic Brownian motion. Finally, the investigator is deriving more results on the behavior of processes with dependence on the past.        The work in the current proposal falls into the general area of Stochastic Analysis. This means the analysis of  randomly evolving phenomena. The portions of this proposal on coupling are related to the smoothness of temperature distributions on surfaces, their rate of convergence to a steady state and the dependence of these on the geometry of the surface. The problems on processes whose behavior depends on the past have potential applications to economics (prices e.g.) and to biology (chemotactic phenomena.)  The work on relativistic Brownian motion can have potential applications to cosmology, especially in deciding whether it is possible to observe black holes."

The first set of questions relates to the law of the iterated logarithm for degenerate U-statistics, particularly when the kernel is not square integrable, and to applications of U-processes to the asymptotics of lifetime distributions for truncated and/or censored data. In a second related set of questions the investigator and collaborators approximate spectra of compact integral operators by the spectra of certain random matrices and study several aspects of this approximation. The procedure amounts to discretizing the kernel by means of a random grid instead of the usual deterministic grids. The third main area of research concerns selfnormalized sums of independent identically distributed random variables, which are related to the Student t-statistic, and the aim is to determine the set of distributions for which the t-statistic is asymptotically standard normal, or converges in distribution, or is tight. The investigator also studies the bootstrap in some non-standard situations. These seemingly diverse sets of problems have in common the use of many techniques from limit theory, particularly empirical processes and  Probability in Banach Spaces, some of them previously developed by the researcher in collaboration with others.  One ongoing project of this researcher to study so-called U-statistics and U-processes and to expand the scope of their applicability. Knowing their properties should help us better understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since U-statistics are their building blocks. In particular, some of this research will help to better assess the accuracy of statistical procedures currently used in the study of censored and/or truncated data in Medicine, Astronomy and other fields.  Another project involves approximation of spectra of operators,  which are mathematical objects that describe the behavior of systems such as chemical reactions. The third main topic of proposed research concerns the celebrated 'Student t-statistic,' a classical statistical object familiar to virtually everyone who does data analysis.  This research is related to determining when the t-statistic can be safely used."

Among the phenomena these systems model are: competition of species, epidemics, spread of genetic traits, catalytic chemical reactions, as well as many others.  The investigator will pursue research on several specific problems.  The first project involves the parabolic Anderson model as an interacting diffusion, and associated critical phenomena.  The second project concerns the behavior of one-dimensional interfaces regions.  This continues work on a model for hybrid zones or ""narrow"" coexistence zones of different species.  The third project attempts to model species abundance distributions with an interacting particle system model.  This builds on related work modeling the relationship between species number and area.  The fourth project involves possible extensions of a recently discovered comparison technique for interacting systems.  Since exact calculations are usually difficult or impossible to make, comparison methods are important tools for analyzing new systems.  This proposal involves research on several topics in the theory and application of interacting particle systems. .  Among the phenomena these systems model are: competition of species, epidemics, spread of genetic traits, catalytic chemical reactions, as well as many others.  The goal of this research is to obtain a better qualitative understanding of various complex phenomena that interacting particle systems model well. For example, a simple model for the evolution and extinction of species, to study species abundance questions, fits into this framework.  It is based on the birth, death, movement, and reproduction, with a small mutation rate, of individuals.  The investigator hopes to show that this type of model can explain the data patterns observed in the field.  Part of the proposed research concerns very specific models and questions such as this one, and part of the proposed researc h will aim at developing general mathematical techniques for handling models of this type."

It is hoped to establish the existence of a nontrivial multifractal spectrum for harmonic measure of a Brownian path, where the spectrum is given in terms of certain critical exponents for Brownian motion.  The proposer will also continue the program of investigating nonintersecting Brownian motions with the aim to establish rigorously the predictions of two-dimensional exponents given by nonrigorous conformal field theory.  Random walk analogues will be studied at the same time.  Other geometric properties of paths will be studied, such as the percolation exponent for Brownian motion which quantifies the notion of the thinnest subpath.  Study of the percolation exponent will lead to the study of processes obtained by removing loops from the Brownian path.  The path of a Brownian motion is an example of a random multifractal, a set whose ``dimension'' looks different at different points.  It is the path traversed by a randomly moving particle.  Multifractals have been studied in a number of contexts in science, but there are very few examples where one can establish rigorously the multifractal behavior. The proposer intends to try to analyze rigorously the multifractal behavior for the Brownian motion path.  Related to this project is the attempt to understand ``nonconformal field theory''---a powerful tool in theoretical physics which is not sufficiently understood on a mathematical level to allow for rigorous analysis."

It is of intrinsic interest to probabilists, and of more general interest because of ties to PDE theory, and because it may turn out to be a very important process for modeling purposes and  as a building block from which other measure valued processes can be  constructed. This project is primarily aimed at seeing how well SBM indeed  serves as such a building block, by investigating a number of other infinite dimensional stochastic processes that can be built either from SBM or from simple variants of it. The first example that will be tackled is  a ``super iterated Brownian motion'' that seems to be accessible to this approach and yet is a stochastic process which promises a lot of surprises in its structure and behavior.  As a modeling tool, the random processes that will be studied in this project have applications to a wide diversity of different fields. They provide good models for studying the development of genetic diversity over a large  number of generations, and, indeed, it was as models here that superprocesses originally developed. In this and related projects, the PI and his colleagues will also be using superprocesses to study the dispersion of mass via ocean  currents. It is hoped that the models developed will lead to a better  understanding of the statistical aspects of, for example, the spread of ocean pollutants. Another side benefit will be the study of the spatial  structure of populations of small ocean dwelling organisms such as plankton, a topic of both ecological and defense (radar) interest."

U-statistics are commonly encountered in problems concerning estimation, while multilinear forms arise in research pertaining to  multiple stochastic integration, regression and covariance analysis, and invertibility of matrices. Randomly stopped sums of independent random variables and martingales are found at the core of the studies of sequential analysis, and such diverse areas as queuing theory, inventory theory and reliability theory. The investigator and his colleagues consider fairly general problems involving sums of dependent random variables, including extensions of Wald's equation in the case of martingales, quadratic forms and  double stochastic integrals; approximations of the tail probabilities of multilinear forms; generalization of the principle of conditioning to a wider class of problems; and determination of speeds of convergence of related limit theorems. In tackling the proposed problems, the investigator and his colleagues draw from their recent results which include two fundamental contributions to the theories of sequential analysis, U-statistics and empirical processes.   The investigator and his colleagues deal with several problems whose solution would have a beneficial impact on several areas of probability and statistics. The broad area consists of the study of the properties of phenomena that exhibit high levels of inter-dependence and, hence, are hard to analyze on their own. The difficulty stems from the strong links present with other components. The approach followed by the investigator and his colleagues when dealing with this type of problem consists in introducing a new set of phenomena that closely resembles the original one but which in addition has desirable independence properties. In probabilistic language, one calls this approach to dealing with dependence a de-coupling of t he dependence of a phenomenon. Up to now there are several results developed in this area which typically produce optimal results. The investigator and his colleagues continue to apply this theory to problems in sequential analysis, U-statistics and stochastic integration. The statistical theory of sequential analysis was introduced during World War II as a means of optimizing resources. In sharp contrast with the typical statistical approach of assigning a prefixed sample and analyzing the data only after the sample size has been achieved, the sequential approach permits the optimization of resources by closely following the development of the process at each stage of the experiment. The sequential approach is particularly useful in cases of destructive sampling, as in  equipment and supply lifetime studies in military equipment and industrial applications. In medical studies, its application allows both to optimize resources and to  deal with the ethical issues of terminating early a clinical trial when there is strong indication that the drug under study is harmful or proven to be beneficial, without having to wait until a pre-fixed sample size has been attained in accordance with the classical approach."

Although typically appealing to different groups of researchers, both areas deal with large systems of objects, such as particles or customers, which are connected together by some interaction rule. Interacting particle systems research usually deals with lattice-valued random systems which update according to some local rule. Such systems model various complex random systems and exhibit a wide range of spatial behavior; they frequently occur in the context of mathematical physics and mathematical biology.  One is interested in the long-time behavior of such systems, such as the behavior of the associated equilibria. The investigator intends to work on topics such as the structure of multitype particle systems, systems with annihilation and creation, the equilibria of certain semi-infinite systems, and interface dynamics.  Queueing networks research studies the evolution of queues of individuals under different rules for routing and assigned priorities. As time evolves, individuals enter the system, move from one queue to the next, and, upon completion of service, exit from the system. Depending on specifics, such a system may or may not be stable; the goal of much recent research has been to analyze such behavior.  A recent important tool for such problems is the use of fluid limits, with which problems on stability of networks can be reduced to the stability of the associated fluid models.  The investigator intends to investigate the properties of some of the main classes of fluid models, and apply this analysis to the study of stability questions for networks and to the related topic of heavy traffic limits for networks.      The investigator's research lies primarily in two areas of probability theory, interacting particle systems and queueing networks. The field of interacting particle systems typically deals with large random systems.  The compon ents of these systems can represent, for example, particles, cells, or various organisms.  Such systems model various complex random systems and exhibit a wide range of behavior; they frequently occur in the context of mathematical physics and mathematical biology.  One is typically interested in the long-time behavior of such systems.  The topics the investigator intends to work on include biological models for the diversity and stability of different species, and physical models for the evolution of chemical reactions.  The field of queueing networks studies the behavior of lines of individuals in general settings. These individuals can, for example, be customers waiting to be served, or components involved in some manufacturing process.  As time evolves, individuals enter the system, move from one line to the next, and, upon completion of service, exit from the system. A general unsolved problem is to find which systems are stable, that is, the lengths of their lines do not tend to grow as time increases.  This information can then be used to indicate more efficient algorithms for the service of customers, with the goal of saving time and materials.  A recent important tool for the analysis of queueing networks is the use of fluid models, which are nonrandom simplifications of the original networks. The investigator intends to continue his work in the area by studying and applying the properties of fluid models."

Griffeath exploits this ""symbiosis"" in his theoretical and empirical studies of cellular automaton dynamics and other nonlinear spatial interactions. On the theoretical side, this work is giving rise to an increasingly rich and illuminating rigorous theory of Threshold Growth, a new paradigm for discrete-time parallel updating of lattice configurations. On the empirical side, Griffeath is developing effective, interactive simulation tools for the study of complex spatial systems, designing two platforms in parallel: (a) a high-end simulator based on the new CAM8 cellular automaton machine from MIT, of which he has one of the first few prototypes in the world; and (b) a low-end 32-bit Windows 95 simulator and graphical front end called WinCA. Over the next three years, among the types of dynamical system Griffeath intends to study using this hybrid methodology are various cellular automata, interacting particle systems, and individual-based models that serve as prototypes for such complex phenomena as nucleation, spiral formation in excitable media, the shape theory of crystal growth, flocking, host-parasite interactions, dendritic growth, and phase separation by surface tension.    Mathematical models for growth and competition have played a key role in the development of spatial complex systems theory since the mid 1950's. An extensive body of theory and applications, for both random and deterministic systems, has been developed, especially over the past twenty years. Modeling of such fundamental phenomena as aggregation, emergence of shape, interfacial competition, and droplet interaction sheds new light on many areas of applied science. Griffeath's work during the next funding period will be motivated especially by problems elicited from the spatial mathematical ecology community, as identi fied during an interdisciplinary conference that he organized at the Santa Fe Institute during January, 1996. He expects that the various simulation tools he is developing will be able to provide new insights into questions of genuine interest to that clientele, and that a substantial body of interesting new pure mathematics will result as well."

Work on Markov processes will focus on measure-valued processes related to population genetics and other population models and new types of stochastic equations for Markov processes.  New models for spatial point processes will be developed and corresponding statistical issues addressed.  Previous work on stochastic equations driven by semimartingale random measures will be extended with particular emphasis on infinite systems of equations and models arising in the study of stochastic networks.  Theoretical developments for general stochastic control problems will include approximation methodology and existence theorems for optimal singular controls.       The study of stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions of natural phenomena governed by ""random"" or ""chance"" mechanisms.  Mathematical models of such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or both.  The research to be performed is concerned with developing methods for specifying these mathematical models, approximating complex models by simpler ones, and determining how to influence or ""control"" the evolution of the models and the phenomena they represent.  Several particular types of models will be studied."

In large deviation theory, regeneration and renewal methods will be used to extend the applicability of sub-additivity arguments to Markov additive processes and to infinite memory chains.  This yields quick and direct methods to establish existence of a large deviation principle.  New techniques for identifying the relevant rate functions will be investigated.  Large deviation of the iterates of certain monotone maps related to the infinite order chains will be studies by the above methods.  Electron-photon cascades will be studied as special cases of multi-type branching random walks.  An open question on the balance between electrons and photons above a fixed energy at large depths of an absorber will be studied.  Large deviation theory is the study of the estimation and approximation of very small probabilities.  These arise in the study of transmission errors in information communication, in studying large exceedances in random networks, in estimating failure probabilities in large systems (e.g. insurance companies) and many other settings.  New techniques will be developed and applied to study the rate at which these probabilities decrease as the number of observations increases.  A second subject to be studied is a model for electron-photon cascades, in particular, the ratio of the number of electrons to photons above a given energy level."

This includes the development  of suitable abstract mathematical tools, the identification of  models which lead naturally to interesting large deviation  questions, and the computation of the analytical expression of  specific rate functions.  The scope of the project includes the  following situations:  (i) trajectories of Markov processes (ii)  trajectories of certain classes of semimartingales (iii)  empirical measures under various dependence conditions.  A  fundamental theme in Probability Theory and its applications is  the study of situations in which a sequence of averages  constructed from a stochastic sequence converges in some sense to  a deterministic limit.  Large Deviation theory deals with the  problem of estimating the small probabilities that the averages  will deviate from the ""typical behavior"" represented by the  limit.  Here are two situations to which the proposed research  has direct or potential relevance; (a) Probabilistic models are  increasingly used in analyzing the performance of complex  communication systems and computer networks. Large Deviation  theory (in particular, large deviations of certain Markov  processes) is a powerful tool in the analysis of rare events  (that is, deviations from ""normal behavior"") in large systems of  those types. (b) Large Deviation theory is very useful in the  analysis of rare events associated to thermodynamic limits in  several important models in Statistical Mechanics."

The methods employed are taken from ergodic theory, probability, and statistical physics.   This work consists of four topics:  (i) mathematical properties of neural networks, (ii) extreme value estimation, (iii) continued fraction algorithms, and (iv) random substitution processes.  (i) A neural network is a type of self-programming computer that learns by example, essentially adjusting itself to adapt to its environment.  Neural networks--though not yet well understood, mathematically--are already in commercial use in such areas as handwriting readers, DNA classifiers, and financial forecasters. With greater understanding will come more enlightened use. (ii) The investigator and his colleagues are developing extreme value estimation algorithms to help solve an estimation problem needed in the design of structures such as off-shore oil platforms which require a high probability of withstanding storms.  Typically, there is limited historical data from which to make these estimates.  The algorithms are used to estimate the most powerful storm that is likely to occur in the vicinity of the structure in the next 20 years. (iii) Continued fractions have the property of being the most economical way to approximate a real number by a fraction.  They consist of fractions containing fractions containing fractions, etc., etc. The investigator and his colleagues look at these as dynamical systems to study their properties.  This work ties together ideas from probability theory, group theory, and flows on  surfaces.  (iv) The investigator is studying random substitution schemes as they are natural ways of creating strings of symbols with random properties, using a simple recipe.  This idea may also be used to generate tilings of the plane or space that have properties of randomness and determinism.  The construction begins with a set of tiles (or simple shapes) and decompositions of these tiles so that each piece of each decomposition is a scale replica of one of the original tiles.  This procedure is continued, decomposing to finer and finer scales, zooming the scale.  This may give models of materials in nature, as has been the case for non-random versions of this procedure."

Work in three areas is proposed: quadratic (bilinear) forms having a fixed number of summands, ones having a random number of summands, and improved tail probability approximations for Poissonized sums of independent random variables.  In the first such area it is anticipated that results will be obtained which identify the order of magnitude of the expectation of a function of the absolute value of a bilinear form (and also of a generalized U-statistic) of a fixed number of independent real-valued random variables, for any non-decreasing function of at most polynomial growth without further assumptions on the bilinear form, the generalized U-statistics, the distributions, or the number of independent variates.  The second problem area, worked on if time permits, will attempt to establish similar results regarding the expectation of the maximum absolute value of one specific family of bilinear forms of independent and identically distributed mean zero random variates, maximized up to a stopping time determined by the variates themselves.  Thirdly, the proposer and colleagues will attempt to produce improved and best possible tail probability approximations for Poissonized sums of independent random variables satisfying certain constraints.  Probabilistic issues crop up whenever numbers are important and total knowledge or command of the situation is rendered humanly impossible.  For example, the management of a chain store (e.g. Sears or Macy's) must continually make decisions concerning how much of its capital to allocate to each of a multitude of items.  Yet it does not really know the entire sales picture.  Not only does management not know future trends, it doesn't know what the current sales results are for comparable or competitive items sold by other companies in similar locations -- and management may not have full comprehension of the contributory factors influencing its own sales  pattern.  To make good financial decisions, management needs a fairly comprehensive and continually updated mathematical model of its fiscal situation.  For instance, it needs to know what is the chance that it will have more than d unsold dresses of cost c or more in a given store, as well as throughout the company.  To assess the sensitivity of its profitability to variations in materials and labor costs as well as consumer demand the company may want to compute expectations involving quantities which mathematicians recognize as quadratic forms or generalized U-statistics.  Thus, if their utility were properly recognized, the results to be obtained in this proposal might well be of substantial industrial interest."

In this spirit, one part of the proposal is to develop a new approach to the emergence of the giant component in random graph theory, by representing limit component sizes as excursion lengths in a Brownian-type process. This representation opens up a relation between two well-studied but hitherto apparently unrelated areas of probability theory. Other parts of the proposal include foundational work relating to mixing times for Markov chains, and analysis of specific randomized algorithms.    As background, the study of matter aggregating into clusters is of interest in many areas of science: polymers in physical chemistry, condensation of raindrops in clouds, and formation of galaxies in the early universe, to name just three examples.  Models of clustering incorporating the effects of randomness received some attention from physicists in the early and mid 1980s, but faded out when the mathematical tools then available had been used to their limits.  The main part of this proposal  concerns detailed study of one particular model of this kind via sophisticated modern mathematical tools.  It is hoped that  new tools to be developed under this proposal will be useful in at least some of these scientific areas."

In the past, he helped develop techniques which lead to the derivation of formulae for solutions to certain partial differential equations in terms of integrals over an appropriate path space.  He then used these formulae to obtain quite refined estimates on the solutions represented.  More recently, he has been trying to use related methods to gain insight into differential geometric problems suggested by recent physical considerations.  In particular, he hopes to learn how to construct and analyze diffusions on spaces of loops in a Riemannian manifold.    In the Newtonian picture of the world, physical objects were thought to follow definite paths, and the goal of physics was to predict the path that a particular object would follow.  In the quantum mechanical picture, physical objects are no longer thought to be so constrained.  Instead, they are thought to governed by physical laws which can, at best, predict the probability of their following a particular path.  The Newtonian and quantum picture are reconciled by the fact that, with overwhelming probability, a massive object will follow a path which is close to the one predicted by Newtonian physics.  On the other hand, when dealing with very small objects, the Newtonian prediction can be quite far off, and one can only make predictions by averaging over spaces of paths.  For this reason, it becomes important to understand how to average over paths.  The mathematical theory of averaging over various path spaces has been one of the central themes of  mathematics in this century.  Its applications are numerous and are not restricted to physics.  Indeed, over the past two decades, very sophisticated  path-space models are the basis on which commodities and financial instruments of all sorts have been priced.  Averaging over path spaces is the  central theme of the research proposed in  this project."

Similar difficulties arise in computer science when one seeks to sample randomly from a large combinatorial space whose precise size cannot be ascertained in any reasonable amount of time. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximate sampling approach to such a problem is to construct and run ""for a long time"" a Markov chain with long-run distribution equal to the given distribution.  But determining how long is long enough can be both analytically and empirically difficult. Very recently, researchers have devised an algorithm to use the same Markov chains to produce exact samples from the desired distribution.  However, the running time of the algorithm is unbounded and not independent of the state sampled, so a user with limited patience will introduce systematic bias by aborting a long run.  The investigator assesses the extent of this bias, implements and studies (via a certain ""duality"" theory) the performance of a new algorithm he devises to eliminate the bias, and establishes bounds on the performance of any such Markov-chain-based algorithm.   Physicists are interested in models for ferromagnetism and for phase transitions (such as freezing and thawing).  In such statistical mechanics problems, in image processing (the cleaning up of noisy or blurred images), and in computer science, much can be learned by studying certain probability distributions on sets having enormously large numbers of elements.  The standard ""Monte Carlo"" approach to studying a distribution is to draw a (representative) random sample, but this approach is computationally infeasible for problems of such large size.  To handle such problems, researchers use computers to simulate certain probabilistic processes, called Mar kov chains, which, in a certain precise sense, ""settle down"" to the distribution of interest ""in the long run.""  But determining how long is long enough to run the chain in order to approximate the distribution sufficiently closely can be difficult to assess, both theoretically and empirically.  Very recently, researchers have devised an algorithm to use the same Markov chains to produce exact samples from the desired distribution.  However, the running time of the algorithm is sometimes very large, and the distribution of the output can depend on the running time, so a user with limited patience will introduce systematic bias by aborting a long run. The investigator, a probabilist, assesses the extent of this bias, implements and analyzes the performance of a new algorithm he devises to eliminate the bias, and considers how well any such Markov-chain-based algorithm can perform."

More specifically, the main problems deal with first-passage percolation, ordinary percolation and central limit theorems for optimizing functionals. For the usual first-passage percolation model the proposer wishes to establish some general properties of the asymptotic shape of the set of points which can be reached in a large time; this asymptotic shape should be strictly contained between a romboid and a cube. He also is investigating how the asymptotic shape varies when one allows the passage-time of a vertex to be dependent on how many neighbors have already been reached. In ordinary percolation the investigator (with several colleagues) is investigating the distribution of the size of the largest cluster in a big box, and hopes to establish a number of analogues to known results for the largest cluster on a complete graph in which each edge is present with a certain probability (the Erdos-Renyi random graph). Finally, in a different area, he is attempting to prove central limit theorems for some optimizing functionals which are somewhat similar to minimal spanning trees.   The problems in this proposal are motivated in part by statistical physics and by behavior of certain optimization algorithms. Through the first part of this work one gains insight into the large time behavior of some stochastic growth models, and how variations in the local rules (i.e., rules for the behavior of the system in small neighborhoods) influence the global behavior of the system. The research on optimization algorithms deal with quantities which depend on the distances between a large number of randomly chosen points.  These studies are expected to give us an understanding of the typical behavior of some difficult and important optimization problems for which no good computational methods are known at present."

One of the targets is the boundary theory of superdiffusion on a differentiable manifold  and related problems on the equation Lu=F(u) where L is the second order elliptic differential operator and F is a nonlinear function. Among the problems are the description of all positive solutions and their behavior at the Martin boundary, and criteria for removable boundary singularities in terms of the Martin capacity.  This part of the project has been prepared for by an intensive study, done in the last years,  of the case of a bounded domain with a smooth boundary in a Euclidean space. Another direction iq the investigation of the structure of the most general branching measure-valued process. Previous results have been obtained under an assumption that the second moment of the total mass is finite. There is a hope to remove or to weaken this restriction by using recent progress in the theory of linear additive functionals.  During the last decade branching measure-valued processes  also known as superprocesses  have attracted a great deal of effort from many investigators around the world.  Interest in these processes is motivated by their applications to biology, especially, to population genetics. On the other hand, this class of processes provides new tools for the study of complex physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom."

They apply techniques learned from the study of genetics and random permutations, including couplings, the total variation distance and Wasserstein metric for processes observing some or all of the possible component sizes, size-biased permutations of the components, sampling properties for populations, and Stein's method. The interaction between pure and applied method can be fruitful for both. Techniques motivated by the needs and intuitions from each field can illuminate the other. For example, the applied study of genetics naturally involves sampling from populations, which leads to the notion of a size- biased permutation, which simplifies the understanding of a question from pure math, involving the large prime factors of a random integer. In the other direction, results proved about primes, such as bounds on the ""total variation distance"", anticipated by three decades important work in statistics on the comparison of sampling with and without replacement. The proposed investigation attempts to straddle the boundary between pure and applied math as it relates to genetics, sampling, and prime numbers."
