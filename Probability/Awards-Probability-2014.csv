Phase transitions are one important theme -- vanishing thresholds for homology or homotopy groups as some parameter varies, for example. Also of interest are more geometric notions, such as isoperimetric inequalities and hyperbolicity. Random cell complexes provide high-dimensional analogues of expander graphs, a subject that has been a very active lately, with connections to random matrix theory. The probabilistic method provides a powerful and general framework for generating objects with extremal geometric properties, and progress in this area will lead to intriguing new examples and counterexamples in topological combinatorics and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This research draws on several areas of mathematics to study subtle qualitative features of randomly generated shapes. These interactions are of intrinsic interest within mathematics itself, and the work is also being done with a eye towards practical applications in the emerging area of topological data analysis. The educational activities supported by the grant will be naturally integrated with the research, and the PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate researchers working on projects related to the grant. The PI will continue to be involved with various outreach activities: Colorado Math Olympiad, Canada/USA Mathcamp, math circles, undergraduate math clubs, and problem solving seminars."

Monge in 1781 and rediscovered and crucially developed and applied to areas in economics by L. Kantorovich, eventually earning him the Nobel prize in 1939.  The renaissance of the classical Monge-Kantorovich mass transport topic in the late 1980's is attributed to independent developments by the French mathematician Y. Brenier (studying fluid dynamics),  U.S. mathematician J. Mather in dynamical  systems, and British meteorologist Mike Cullen.  The mathematics of the optimal transport and its extensions has made a tremendous impact on several fields including calculus of variations, functional analysis, geometry, and probability. In recent years the geometry of optimal transport, particularly its link with the so-called Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry, and connections to functional and isoperimetric inequalities  has been extensively investigated resulting in deep and beautiful connections to the above-mentioned topics. The new book by the recent Fields medalist C. Villani is a testament to this explosive development.  What is currently lacking in our understanding, and is actively being sought by various isolated groups,  is the analogous development of the topic in discrete spaces -- developing appropriate ""discrete calculus"" on graphs and finite Markov chains. The PI and his collaborators (including students and postdocs) have identified several concrete directions to make progress, as well as find new applications, in this important and exciting topic.<br/><br/><br/>In recent collaboration, with various collaborators, the PI has initiated a fruitful line of frontier research in developing discrete aspects of the exciting topic of Optimal Transport & Applications. Besides strengthening and refining classical notions, this work identifies several interesting new directions to pursue -- new notions of (Brunn-Minkowski) convexity in graphs, new concentration inequalities (dimension-free, infimum-convolution and transport-entropy inequalities) refining Talagrand's convex distance concentration (and extensions by Marton and others) on non-product spaces, as well as connections to classical sumset inequalities in additive combinatorics. Much of this is motivated by the attempts to understand appropriate metrics and geodesics in optimal transport (of measures) on discrete spaces. Developing the necessary discrete calculus and relating the recently introduced notions of discrete Ricci curvature, displacement convexity and Wasserstein-type metrics in finite graphs and Markov chains, is a technically as well as conceptually challenging objective of the proposal. Connections to other functional inequalities (such as versions Talagrand, Marton transport inequalities) and their equivalent dual formulations provide an important motivation. A second objective is to explore the full extent of applications of the methods developed and the recent theorems proved. While classical theorems (such as the log-Sobolev inequality for the Gaussian measure, Strassen's martingale existence theorem, Talagrand's theorem on the symmetric group) have already been re-derived in the recent initiative of the PI and his collaborators, the full potential needs to be more thoroughly investigated. Concentration inequalities on the noncrossing partition lattice and consequences are a concrete example of new questions that have arisen from this investigation. Another goal of the PI is to compare and constrast the various independent suggested notions of (RiccI) curvature and displacement convexity in discrete spaces."

On the other hand, the analysis of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring and directed polymers will improve out understanding of the universality class.

The examples include, among others, the World Wide Web and the networks of brain neurons. These real-world networks can be effectively modeled by sparse random graphs where the links between the pair of vertices are added under certain stochastic rules. These random graphs have very complex geometry. One way to understand their geometry is to study what are called the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the graphs. For example, by looking at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors one can infer how congested the network is, or identify the different clusters present in the network. A significant part of this proposal is devoted to the study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these sparse random graphs of which very little is known so far. These random graphs with the associated eigenvalues and eigenvectors are also used as a mathematical model to study the propagation of electrons in a disordered medium, that is, a medium with impurities. Some of the questions outlined in this proposal are motivated by the goal of understanding the transport of electromagnetic waves in disordered media. The proposed research will involve active collaborations between the PI and a number of researchers from various US and international universities. <br/><br/><br/>This proposal consists of three directions of research in probability theory, all related to the spectra of sparse random graphs. The first part of this proposal deals with the study of eigenvalue distributions of the adjacency matrices of different models of random graphs with bounded average vertex degrees. In the limit, as the size of the graphs grows to infinity, these eigenvalue distributions exhibit a remarkably complex range of behaviors. The PI will study properties of the eigenvalue distribution for various sparse random graph models, including random graphs with a given degree distribution and percolations on Euclidean lattices, primarily focusing on three key features in the limiting eigenvalue distributions- existence of continuous part, finitely many atoms and gaps in the support. The adjacency matrix of a large sparse random graph can be used as a Hamiltonian for electron hopping on a disordered medium and the study of its eigenvalue distribution is a preliminary step towards understanding whether the medium behaves like a metal or an insulator at different energies. The second part of this proposal deals with a model which was introduced by Hatano and Nelson to study the motion of magnetic flux lines in semiconductors. This can be thought as a non-Hermitian analogue of the famous Anderson model in one dimension. Hatano and Nelson observed contrasting localization behaviors of the eigenvectors associated with the real and the complex eigenvalues. The PI proposes to investigate this phenomenon rigorously and try to understand so-called 'delocalization transition' of the eigenvectors. The final part of this proposal involves a couple of combinatorial optimization problems on sparse random graphs. Each of these problems deals with a combinatorial structure that is connected to the spectra of the underlying graph, but they are interesting on their own. One of them is to understand the behavior of the minimum weight perfect matching on the Euclidean lattices. The variants of this optimization problem has received a lot of attention in the literature. Overall, this proposal consists of a wide range of problems whose solutions will include a combination of a diverse set of tools and ideas from random matrix theory, random Schrodinger operators, graph theory, statistical physics, additive combinatorics and probability."

We are interested in the description of the different behaviors of such systems, when the parameters are vanishing, and of the interplay between different limiting regimes. In particular, we will study new mathematical problems which are important for applications, as well as new effects in classical problems. The treatment of these problems for systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom is a relatively new field of investigation, which has already stirred up a vivid interest in many fields, also because these are very complex objects and any effort that goes in the direction of their simplification is important for a deeper understanding of the main features of the models and for a better effectiveness in applications. Our analysis requires the development of new methods and the substantial introduction of new techniques which have to range over many fields in mathematics.<br/> <br/>Our goal in this proposal is studying small deterministic and stochastic perturbations of a wide class of  systems described by stochastic partial differential equations. As a matter of fact, small perturbations, which are negligible on one time scale, can become crucial on a larger time scale. The long-time influence of small perturbations has been considered in a number of our previous papers, and the present project has to be  considered as a continuation of this program. Limit theorems, especially the large deviation theory, the averaging principle and the interplay between them, as well as several generalizations of the Smoluchowskii-Kramers approximation are our main tools. Systems with many/infinite degrees of freedom often have perturbations of different origin  and different order. Long-time behavior of such perturbed systems should be described by a hierarchy of approximations. On the other hand, long-time behavior of pure deterministic systems with instabilities, under certain conditions, should be described by a stochastic process. Therefore, the natural generality for the problem is in considering both deterministic and stochastic perturbations of stochastic systems (not necessarily deterministic dynamical systems)."

In particular, this research will provide a better understanding of Gaussian-type measures on infinite-dimensional curved spaces. The proposed research is motivated by physics. For example, infinite-dimensional spaces such as loop groups and path spaces appear in quantum field theory (QFT). The PI proposes to formalize and study some of the notions used in physics, such as measures on certain infinite-dimensional spaces. For example, it is common to see computations in QFT literature involving integrals over infinite-dimensional spaces with respect to a fictitious infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure with a Gaussian density normalized by a constant which is infinite. Mathematically this measure can be interpreted as a Wiener measure on a flat space, or as a heat kernel measure on an infinite-dimensional curved space. In addition, this research will connect diverse fields: stochastic analysis, geometric analysis, representation theory and mathematical physics.<br/> <br/>This project is focused on elliptic and subelliptic diffusions in infinite-dimensional curved spaces, such as infinite-dimensional groups, loop groups and path spaces. The questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions of the SDEs and smoothness of solutions will be studied. In general these infinite-dimensional spaces do not have an analogue of the Lebesgue measure or a Haar measure in the group case. In addition, geometry of these spaces will be studied in connection with smoothness properties of heat kernel measures in both elliptic (Riemannian) and subelliptic (sub-Riemannian) settings. The smoothness is interpreted as a Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance. It is an interesting question in itself, and in addition it can give rise to unitary representations of the infinite-dimensional groups. One part of the proposal is devoted to studying of Brownian and energy representations of path groups. In addition, smoothness of finite-dimensional hypo-elliptic heat kernels will be studied. This project will use new techniques coming from harmonic analysis on such spaces. The educational component of the proposal is manifold: a number of projects involve graduate students of the PI; in addition the PI is involved in mentoring and educational activities from the middle school to postdoc levels."

The Midwest Probability Colloquium (MPC) is an annual conference series on probability theory and related topics held every year during the second weekend (Thursday to Saturday) of October at Northwestern University. It has been financially supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation for the past 35 years.  Northwestern University is the other major sponsor by providing the meeting venue and staff support.  Each year October is the time just before the hiring season for mathematics Ph.D's and postdoctors gets earnestly under way. For this reason the conference has always been eagerly anticipated by graduate students and young researchers all over the country. It provides them with a great opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians and to broaden their employment prospects. Among the conferences of similar nature, the MPC stands out for its unique format in dividing its program into tutorial and research programs. The speakers of these programs are selected by a scientific committee elected at the previous year's conference. They are chosen not only for their outstanding research records but also for their excellent lecturing style. <br/><br/>Probability theory is a major branch of modern mathematics. It aims at a rigorous mathematical investigation of collective behavior of random phenomena and is one of the most applicable branches of mathematics. Mathematical models established with the aid of probability theory have been successfully applied in diverse areas such as applied physics, biological science, and finance. Probabilistic models can be roughly classified into two major classes: continuous and discrete. The most important representative of the first class is Brownian motion and general diffusion processes. The second class includes random walks and percolation models. Besides its wide applications in applied sciences and social sciences, the last few decades have also seen probabilistic methods making its sometime unexpected way into other branches of pure mathematics such as differential geometry, number theory, partial differential equations, mathematical physics. The common underlying theme for such applications is that probability theory puts a measure on a space (often a function space or a configuration space) much larger than original problems dictate, thus providing much richer structures and selections of tools to solve original problems. Mathematicians working in probability and related fields are scattered around the country in universities. It is very important for them to have a regular forum at which they can exchange ideas and results and keep informed with the latest development in their respective special areas and to broaden their research prospects. The annual Midwest Probability Colloquium provides such a forum and is one of the most successful and longest running annual meetings of probabilists around the country.<br/><br/>The conference website is at http://www.math.northwestern.edu/mwp/"

First, the PI will study solutions to stochastic differential equations which undergo rare, random transitions between two or more regions of the state space.  The goal of this work is to understand the statistics of these transitions, especially in the small-noise regime: what are the typical pathways by which the transitions occur? what is the typical time required for a transition?  These issues are very relevant to problems in chemistry and molecular dynamics, as well as many other physical systems exhibiting metastable behavior. The second type of stochastic dynamics which the PI will study has to do with stochastic interacting particle systems.  Specific systems to be studied involve random motion, growth, and selection, as in models of evolution, population genetics, adaptive dynamics. The PI will study continuum limits and large-time limits for such systems. In particular, this will illuminate new relations between interacting particle systems and continuum free boundary problems.<br/><br/><br/>When viewed at a certain scale, many physical and biological systems seem to behave randomly or are influenced by small random fluctuations. Mathematical models of such systems involve probability theory.  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to use these mathematical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over a long period of time or over a large spatial region.  Therefore, a fundamental scientific and mathematical problem is to understand how random dynamics or interactions at one spatial or temporal scale influence a system at another spatial or temporal scale. This research project develops mathematical tools for predicting and describing the macroscopic behavior of certain systems which behave randomly at a microscopic level.  The specific systems to be studied are motivated by problems in chemistry and by models of biological evolution. One common feature in these systems is the appearance of random, perhaps rare, transitions: a chemical reaction occurs or a cell produces a mutation. The educational component of the project includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of probability, analysis, and applications, preparing them for careers in STEM-related disciplines."

The proposed activity aims at investigating the evolution of systems with complex interactions, such as  particles moving in a disordered environment, cars navigating their way through traffic, the surface of  a growing crystal, or the boundary of an infected tissue. Complexity is captured by the randomness in the model, both in the environment in which the particles interact or the crystal grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim of the project is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To have a very simple example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of Heads in a large number of tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of getting Heads in one toss. (The mathematical law behind this basic phenomenon is known as the Law of Large Numbers.)  Besides its impact on probability theory and mathematics in general, the proposed activity is expected to have a direct impact on the understanding of many physical systems involving random motion in random or disordered media. Understanding complex interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for society.<br/><br/>The proposed activity is on the subject of random motion in random media. Models in this field have been  intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers. Their importance arises from rigorous mathematical connections to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, and the KPZ universality class.  The PI has already established energy-entropy duality and produced solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions. In particular, the PI proved almost sure existence of Busemann functions for the growth model with general weight distribution. The PI will next generalize this existence result to  positive temperature polymers, as well as higher dimensional models. As a result, KPZ fluctuation exponents become at last accessible for general models, allowing to establish some universal properties for models beyond the narrow set of explicitly solvable cases. This also opens the  door to establishing existence of Busemann functions in the continuum setting of the stochastic heat equation, enabling one to deduce global existence of a solution to the stochastic Burgers equation, as well as access KPZ fluctuation results directly rather than through approximation schemes via discrete models."

The goal of this proposal is to analyze such systems where the interactions have high-dimensional dependence structures and where the extremes (network hubs, low energy configurations, optimal trajectories) play a significant role. As well as being important to probability theory, the results obtained in this proposal will be relevant and applied to many branches of science, as most of the questions were introduced to understand the behavior of various optimization problems in physics, computer science, theoretical biology, and social networks. <br/><br/>More specifically, the proposal involves projects on first-passage percolation (an example of fluid flow in a porous medium) and on mean field spin glass models (example of disordered magnets with frustrated interactions).  The major questions are tied to the complexity of the models, that is, the presence of a large number of extremes and their location in space. In particular the proposer plans to investigate the role played by the functional order parameters in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, mixed p-spin and bipartite models and its relation with the number and location of extremes of the corresponding Hamiltonians. The proposal further addresses fundamental questions on growing interfaces and fluctuations of long chemical chains in a random potential (polymer models). Predictions from physics indicate that, in many of these models, fluctuations should scale sub-linearly with limiting laws that deviate from the standard Gaussian (for instance, which relate to the Tracy-Widom distribution from random matrix theory). This proposal continues and expands the research of the PI on these systems outside the scope of integrable models. In particular, this proposal aims to investigate the universal behavior of scaling exponents, the nature of the limit shape and the geometry of geodesics."

Randomness has long played an important role in the construction of sophisticated mathematical objects and randomness plays a central role in many algorithms in computer science.   Part of this research focuses on objects that are generated by a sequence of dependent random choices.  Such processes can be good models for the dynamics of real-world phenomenon, like the spread of a disease in a network, the evolution of social networks such as facebook or twitter, or phase transitions in materials.  We are particularly interested in the solution of challenging computational problems in the context of random structures, and this work will hopefully be useful in drawing back the shadow of the negative results of complexity theory.<br/><br/><br/>The study of random combinatorial structures has emerged as an important component of Discrete Mathematics.  This research project focuses on various structural properties of random graphs and hypergraphs. One area of emphasis is the study of the existence of Hamilton cycles in various sparse random graph models. It is natural to conjecture that any suitably random model that ensures that a graph has minimum degree 3 will have a Hamilton cycle with high probability.  While this has been established in a few setting, a number of very natural open questions remain, and the development of a unified theory of Hamiltonicity of sparse random graphs is a long range goal of this research.  This project also includes the study of algorithmic questions.  For example, we will put significant effort into the study of Cuckoo hashing.  Here the main question is whether or not the insertion of a new item into the hash table takes constant expected time. Our approach here will be to show that an associated graph has a fast mixing time, applying the theory of mixing times for Markov chains."

Examples of such systems include random stepped surfaces in three-dimensional space which, in particular, model melting crystals; square-ice model which is a mathematical two-dimensional approximation for a thin layer of ice; and interacting particle systems used for modeling (e.g., a one-lane highway, the growth of plankton in the ocean). Our aim is to extract macroscopic properties of very large systems starting from their microscopic definitions, with main accents on the appearance of the universal random fields and distributions.<br/><br/>There are two main distinctions of the systems we study. First is that we concentrate on and explore 2d structures which generalize many classical 1d probabilistic models such as eigenvalues of a random matrix. The two-dimensional extensions that we consider give new and often more natural interpretations of earlier one-dimensional results and also pave the way to prove new interesting asymptotic results about well-known one-dimensional models. Second, most models in this research enjoy a rich algebraic structure, which usually means that expectations of many observables can be computed in a concise manner. The techniques include usage of symmetric functions of representation-theoretic origin, eigenfunctions of difference operators, orthogonal polynomials, etc. This exact solvability provides tools for delicate asymptotic analysis and gives access to the properties of the universal objects appearing in the limit, such as Tracy-Widom distributions, the GUE-eigenvalues distribution, the GUE-corners process (its two-dimensional extension), and the Gaussian Free Field. The results obtained for the exactly solvable models are generally believed to extend to a large variety of similar stochastic systems."

The CLT's main conclusion is that aggregated data follows the so-called Gaussian law, also known as the normal or ""bell"" curve. But scientists in many fields from seismology to computer science to quantitative finance are finding that their data series have long-range correlations, which means that the CLT may or may not be a valid way of looking at how such data aggregates. The PI's work on correlated data sequences, and related questions, would show that the Gaussian-law behavior afforded by the CLT persists up to very long correlation lengths, with some quantitative differences with the standard CLT, such as an increase in how spread out averages tend to get. For instance, one of the PI's theoretical conjectures is that if correlation is long enough, it would take too much data in practice to be able to observe a CLT-type aggregation. The PI will study the effect of even longer-range correlations, showing that instead of bell-curve behavior, data could involve much higher levels of uncertainty (a.k.a. heavy tails), with an extremely slow rate of aggregation. This could be of some significance when applied to financial risk in the housing market: tools could be developed for sellers of institutional mortgage insurance products for highly correlated mortgages; they would help avoid errors in risk calculations, such as those made by the American International Group (AIG) in the years preceding the world financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in a taxpayer-funded bailout upwards of $ 180 billion. The PI also plans to study the implications of long-range correlations in so-called spin models which are useful in the physics of random media, where, unlike the example of mortgage-based financial derivatives, long-range correlations and heavy tails could have little or no influence on the average large-scale behavior. The PI's Ph.D. students will take part in both theoretical and applied aspects of the research, working with the PI to prove theorems and test their results in practice using numerics. Involving students in fundamental research with real-world applications will broadly disseminate scientific understanding. The PI systematically encourages students from underrepresented groups to join the research program.<br/><br/>   The PI proposes a three-year research program in stochastic analysis, with two groups of topics. First, the complexity of asymptotic laws for variations of Gaussian processes with long-range correlations will be evidenced by searching for conditions implying normal, non-normal, and conditionally normal limits in general situations, including sharp convergence rates. Second, the PI will analyze densities, tails, and convex functionals, spin systems, and hitting probabilities, for general Malliavin-differentiable non-Gaussian processes and fields. A main set of tools is the new use of the Malliavin calculus for quantitative estimates of various distances between laws of random variables on Wiener space. This includes the PI's formula for the density of general random variables on Wiener space, proved with I. Nourdin in 2009. Another tool is the PI's comparison of convex functionals for random vectors and fields on Wiener space, proved in 2013 with I. Nourdin and G. Peccati. Yet another is the first sharp estimates of distances to the normal law on Wiener space, proved in 2012 and 2013 by Bierme, Bonami, Nourdin, and Peccati. The PI will forego power-scale model assumptions such as self-similarity and/or stationarity whenever possible, using instead assumptions which are intrinsic to general covariance structures. One of the consequence of the work will be to show that well-known behaviors in so-called critical cases for power variations can be artefacts of the chosen model classes. Another will be to find out the extend of the so-called Sherrington-Kirkpatrick universality class for spin systems in random media, and to determine behaviors when heavy tails and long-range correlations cause spin systems to exit this class. A third consequence should be to understand the critical cases for hitting probabilities of fractional Brownian motion."

This proposal aims to further develop the theory of such processes, with three concrete application areas in mind.   The first area concerns random networks that arise in biology, manufacturing, and other service systems when they operate near capacity.  The performance of these networks can often be described by diffusions that are constrained to have nonnegative components.  A second area is in mathematical finance, where the advent of electronic exchanges driven purely by the flow of orders has revolutionized the method by which prices are formed.  The price process in a model of strategic agents who place buy and sell limit orders can be better understood by studying a class of constrained processes.  The third area involves the study of scaling limits of random matrices, which arise in many areas, including physics and engineering.  The gaps between the eigenvalues of some classes of high-dimensional random matrices, when properly scaled, can be shown to be approximated by constrained multi-dimensional diffusions with singular drift.  The proposal seeks to develop a unified theory for the construction and study of these processes, and to examine their implications for the described applications.   Another theme of the proposal involves the study of planar obliquely reflected diffusions.  Planar stochastic processes have been the focus of active research over the last two decades.  Finally, the proposal also has a substantial educational component that includes training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students, as well as new course development.  It also entails a broader effort that coordinates several graduate students in outreach activities aimed at communicating mathematics to a broader audience.<br/><br/>This is an interdisciplinary proposal that focuses on several problems in probability that require substantial use of analytical techniques.   The first theme concerns various aspects of obliquely reflected diffusions, including the construction and properties of obliquely reflected Brownian motions in bounded planar domains, and also excursion reflected Brownian motion which arises in the boundary theory of Markov processes.  It also involves the development of a common framework for the analysis of diffusions with both reflection and singular drift, large deviations of semimartingale reflected Brownian motions and a free boundary problem related to a two-dimensional reflected Brownian motion.  These are motivated by applications in queuing networks, biology, and mathematical finance.   The tools that will be used intersect with several areas of mathematics including analysis (in particular, complex analysis, conformal mappings, harmonic analysis, functional analysis,  partial differential equations and free-boundary problems).  There are also implications of this work for mathematical physics, specifically the study of repulsive particle models associated with random matrices."

The rules of the sandpile are simple: given a configuration of ""chips"" on an infinite chessboard (i.e., the integer lattice), one can ""topple"" any square with at least 4 chips, by sending one chip from this square to each of its four neighboring squares.  When begun from a single large stack of chips and continued until no square has more than 3 chips, the result is a striking fractal configuration.  Studying this process has lead to the discovery of surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics, and this project aims to leverage these new connections both for the sake of a deeper understanding of the sandpile process, and to enrich our understandings of these other areas as well.  This area of mathematics has connections with phase transitions and conformal field theory in physics as well.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project concerns the so-called Abelian sandpile model of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld.  By identifying new connections between integer superharmonic functions, Apollonian circle packings, and certain regular tilings of the Euclidean plane, we are now able to characterize the scaling limit of the sandpile and analyze its local fractal structure. This project has two primary goals.  The first is to extend our knowledge of the sandpile: for example, we would like to strengthen the kind of convergence we can prove the sandpile process admits, characterize solutions to long-studied instances of the Dirichlet problem for the sandpile, and extend our knowledge of the scaling limit of the sandpile process beyond the universe of the square lattice.  On the other hand, we would like to bring new perspectives developed for our analysis of the sandpile to bear on other areas, with the possibility of confirming number-theoretic conjectures regarding Apollonian circle packings, or characterizing tilings of the plane with certain symmetry properties."

This research project first concerns the local universality of such statistics, enlarging the class of models presenting the random matrices type of interactions; this includes the study of the so-called beta-ensembles, proving that the local interactions of the energy levels of many random Hamiltonian systems only depend on the their invariance type, and the analysis of universality for bidimensional spectra, appearing in non-Hermitian random matrix theory.

Analogously to the Gaussian distribution, describing the fluctuations of many systems with underlying independence, random matrix theory statistics appear universally for many strongly correlated systems.

The main goal is the analysis of steady statistical patterns in stochastic processes associated with random media such as random Lagrangian systems, directed polymers, random growth models, and models of stochastic hydrodynamics. Ergodicity is a form of stochastic stability that means that the long-term statistical properties of the system are not sensitive to the initial state. In particular, it makes measurements related to complex systems meaningful. Long-term statistical patterns in deterministic and random dynamical systems can be described via stationary distributions, and it is the description of these stationary regimes that the project aims at. It builds around the momentum that has been created by recent progress by the PI in ergodic theory of the Burgers equation and related systems. The central role of the Burgers equation is due to the fact that it is fundamental in modeling a variety of phenomena from traffic to the formation of large scale structure of the Universe. It is simultaneously a fluid dynamics model, a growth model, a conservation law, and is tightly related to stochastic control, directed polymers, and an important KPZ universality class of models of statistical mechanics. The proposed program will extend the understanding  of statistical patterns for the Burgers equation and related complex random dynamical systems in noncompact settings.<br/><br/>Studying ergodic properties of stochastic partial differential equations or similar models in unbounded domains calls for development of new mathematical techniques. The project will use and enhance modern methods of mathematical statistical mechanics, probability theory, and dynamics, techniques developed for first-passage percolation and last passage percolation models, lattice animals, concentration inequalities, stochastic control, thermodynamic limits for Gibbs ensembles and hydrodynamic limits for interacting particle systems, along with variational approach and analysis techniques such as inequalities and embeddings,  typical for partial differential equations.

The proposal further addresses fundamental questions on growing interfaces and fluctuations of long chemical chains in a random potential (polymer models). Predictions from physics indicate that, in many of these models, fluctuations should scale sub-linearly with limiting laws that deviate from the standard Gaussian (for instance, which relate to the Tracy-Widom distribution from random matrix theory). This proposal continues and expands the research of the PI on these systems outside the scope of integrable models.

The Northeast Probability Seminar is a two-day conference to be held annually during the month of November. The goal of the conference is to have talks by both well established and promising probabilists. The organizers will continue to invite women to speak and to seek speakers from other underrepresented groups. The meetings will have four featured talks, two on Thursday morning and two on Friday morning. Thursday and Friday afternoons will be set aside for informal sessions where participants will be encouraged to give ten-minute presentations of their recent work or to discuss open problems.<br/><br/>Specialized mathematical meetings like this are very important. They give people an opportunity to exchange ideas and try out new theories. They also give young people an opportunity to question experienced mathematicians. Regional meetings are especially important because it is easy to follow up on significant conversations. They also foster the sense of belonging to a group of active researchers--in this case the Northeast Probability group.The conference website is: http://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/probability/NortheastProbabilitySeminar/"

The meeting is organized under the auspices of the Bernoulli Society of the International Statistics Institute, and co-sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. SPA conferences traditionally cover a wide range of current research topics in theoretical and applied probability, stochastic processes and statistical mechanics. The core of the present edition consists of scaling limits for random processes in discrete space, like interacting particle systems and models from Statistical Physics. Models such as exclusion processes, percolation and Ising give rise to continuum objects governed by PDEs or SPDEs, with the KPZ equation and the SLE emerging as the most relevant limiting objects. More applied topics as neuroscience and mathematic models for adaptive dynamics are also well represented, as well as Boltzmann equations, aging, hydrodynamic limits and spin glasses. In addition to plenary lectures by distinguished speakers there will time for young researchers, post docs and graduate students to present their results and interact with each other and with the experts.<br/><br/>Stochastic modeling has become ubiquitous these says.  Realistic modeling is done at the smallest scale where it is easy to understand the physical process. But questions are often asked about what happens in a much larger scale. The transition involves a scaling limit and in this process certain universal behavior emerges. Different models at the micro level exhibit similar qualitative behavior at the macro scale. This notion of universality is important to understand from a mathematical point of view. The noise or randomness present at the micro level, while it is often suppressed in large scales, sometimes persists.  When it does, the statistics of this noise shows a universal behavior, and it is important to understand what to expect in a given situation.  There has been considerable progress recently along these lines and this has created a buzz. The conference will provide a forum for learning and exchanging   ideas about them.<br/><br/>Meeting web site: mate.dm.uba.ar/~probab/spa2014/about.html"

The main goal is the analysis of steady statistical patterns in stochastic processes associated with random media such as random Lagrangian systems, directed polymers, random growth models, and models of stochastic hydrodynamics. Ergodicity is a form of stochastic stability that means that the long-term statistical properties of the system are not sensitive to the initial state. In particular, it makes measurements related to complex systems meaningful. Long-term statistical patterns in deterministic and random dynamical systems can be described via stationary distributions, and it is the description of these stationary regimes that the project aims at. It builds around the momentum that has been created by recent progress by the PI in ergodic theory of the Burgers equation and related systems. The central role of the Burgers equation is due to the fact that it is fundamental in modeling a variety of phenomena from traffic to the formation of large scale structure of the Universe. It is simultaneously a fluid dynamics model, a growth model, a conservation law, and is tightly related to stochastic control, directed polymers, and an important KPZ universality class of models of statistical mechanics. The proposed program will extend the understanding  of statistical patterns for the Burgers equation and related complex random dynamical systems in noncompact settings.<br/><br/>Studying ergodic properties of stochastic partial differential equations or similar models in unbounded domains calls for development of new mathematical techniques. The project will use and enhance modern methods of mathematical statistical mechanics, probability theory, and dynamics, techniques developed for first-passage percolation and last passage percolation models, lattice animals, concentration inequalities, stochastic control, thermodynamic limits for Gibbs ensembles and hydrodynamic limits for interacting particle systems, along with variational approach and analysis techniques such as inequalities and embeddings,  typical for partial differential equations. The description and analysis of stationary distributions will be obtained via sample measures, one force one solution principles, random one-sided Lagrangian minimizers and their polymer counterparts."

For example a fluid is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale?  As another example, how fast the clotting (coagulation) should occur for a liquid (such as blood) to turn to a gel? The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting particles is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of our microscopic world. The investigator also emphasizes on applying geometric and probabilistic ideas in order to develop new insights into complex dynamics of fluids.<br/> <br/>The proposal addresses the scaling and collective behavior of various stochastic and deterministic models that are of interest in statistical mechanics and differential geometry. These models are either formulated as interacting particle systems, partial differential equations or variational problems. In particular, the proposal suggests applying geometric and probabilistic ideas to study fluid equations. Also, Optimal Transport type problems are proposed for symplectic and contact forms that could play a role in understanding fluid equations. As another application of probabilistic ideas in differential geometry, we propose to study the set of fixed points for stochastic symplectic maps that appear as the flows associated with models in celestial mechanics. The proposal also formulates precise conjectures for particle systems modeling the phenomena of coagulation and formation of gels."

One such question we will address involves analysing algorithms for detecting sub-communities within a social network by investigating the graph of friendship relations. The proposal addresses questions from combinatorics and computer science about when random combinatorial and computational problems have solutions, such as when there is a colouring in a random graph.  Ideas from statistical physics give predictions for these thresholds which we will mathematically prove.  It also studies questions of how long it takes random processes on networks, such as the Glauber dynamics Markov chain, to reach their equilibrium distribution and how this depends on their initial starting position.  Such processes are used as algorithms for sampling high dimensional distributions.  The proposal focuses on development of mathematical theory with a view to better understanding these problems.  Finally the proposal will support the development of new graduate courses in discrete probability and stochastic process on random graphs as well as providing research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications across a range of stochastic processes on networks. One aspect involves studying phase transitions of Gibbs measures on random graphs, particularly random constraint satisfaction problems.  Here we hope to establish conjectures from statistical physics for a range of models such as the chromatic and independence numbers on random graphs.  A second theme is the development of new tools for establishing rough isometries and other geometric notions of closeness between random metric spaces.  In particular we will consider whether independent copies of Poisson processes, percolation clusters and SLE curves are rough isometries or quasi-symmetries.  Finally the proposal will consider Markov random fields such as the Ising model on lattices.  At high temperatures it will consider the question of universality of the cutoff phenomena as well as the effect of different initial conditions on the mixing time.  At low temperatures it will pursue a better understanding of Ising interfaces in order to establish rapid mixing results."

This is important for theoretical reasons as it helps validate the use of phenomenological theories whenever small-scale phenomena are not expected to be of relevance, but has also practical consequences as one also needs a recipe for computing various material constants that enter the governing phenomenological equations. The present proposal goes some way towards these goals by analyzing specific systems where large scale phenomena give rise to a new degree of regularity. These systems are of interest for material theory and statistical mechanics in general.<br/><br/>The specific problems proposed to be studied divide into five specific subareas: (1) Random metric structures on the line associated with long-range percolation, (2) Fluctuation theory and homogenization in random resistor networks, (3) Extreme points of the two-dimensional discrete Gaussian Free Field, (4) Stationary Diffusion-Limited Aggregation, (5) Isoperimetric Wulff problems in random environment. A common feature of these problems is that, in the limit when a natural parameter related to size tends to infinity, a limiting structure emerges. This structure can be deterministic, e.g., a limit shape in question (5), or random, e.g., a Poisson process with random fractal intensity measure in question (3) above. The questions to be studied have bearing on several subject areas of probability and statistical mechanics, e.g., disordered systems, growth processes, extreme-order statistics, random geometry. Methods and tools will be borrowed from other parts of mathematics as well, e.g., harmonic analysis, differential equations, homogenization theory and geometric measure theory."

On the probability side,  the problems are formulated in terms of the behavior of stochastic processes which extend in a natural way Brownian motion. These processes, called Levy processes after the French mathematician Paul Levy, play an important role in many areas of mathematics.  They have applications in fields as diverse as life and physical sciences and economics.  They have been particularly useful in the modeling of financial markets. On the partial differential equations and spectral theory side, they involved extensions of classical theories to operators which are used to model phenomena involving fractional diffusions.   <br/><br/>Mathematically the problems are as follows. (1) Trace asymptotics for Schrodinger operators on Euclidean spaces for  the generator of rotationally symmetric stable processes (fractional Laplacian) with smooth  potentials.  In the case of the Laplacian this produces the famous heat invariants for potentials which are used in inverse scattering and other problems in spectral theory arising in areas of mathematical physics.  Questions of scattering and resonances for stable processes  and connections  <br/>to  heat invariants for the fractional Laplacian will be explored. (2)  A two-term  Weyl's asymptotic law for domains on Euclidean spaces.  The probabilistic techniques introduced by Mark Kac in the early 50's to prove the celebrated ""Weyl's First Law"" on the growth of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian (Brownian motion) in terms of the volume of the domain can be used to extend this result to the eigenvalues of many other Levy processes. These probabilistic/heat equation methods fail to give ""Weyl's Second Law? which is a much deeper result and which was proved in 1980 for the Laplacian by Ivrii and shortly thereafter by Melrose.  On the other hand, the analysis techniques of Ivrii and Melrose also fail primarily due to the boundary conditions needed to deal with processes with jumps. The failure of both the current probabilistic and analytic methods makes these problems extremely challenging. In order to make progress on these  questions, brand new techniques will have to be developed. Such techniques will likely impact several fields in mathematics, including probability and spectral theory. These projects will involve the training of graduate students.  The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the web.  As in previous NSF grants awarded to the PI, serious efforts will be made to involve students and young Ph.D.'s from underrepresented groups on this research."

First discovered in the description of the largest eigenvalues for certain large random matrices, these laws are now understood to serve the role of the ""bell curve"" (or provide the appropriate central limit theorem) for a wide area of modern nonlinear phenomena. The main objective of the proposed research is to advance our understanding of these and other probability laws introduced through the study of random matrices.

These extensions have the advantage of embedding the more familiar triple(s) of limit laws (tied to the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry classes) into a one-parameter family of distributions defined via random differential operators. The first goal is to extend universality results for these distributions using the random operator approach. A second goal is to establish non-communative versions of certain Brownian functional identities (for instance, the Dufresne identities) of current interest given their role in the KPZ universality class. The final project is to prove universal local limit theorems for a class of solvable logarithmic gas ensembles of multiple charges which interpolate among the classical orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles."

They have recently been called to focus on matters traditionally away from their realm, for instance on questions arising from socio-economic investigations.  This situation presents a new opportunity for growth of the fields.  This set of meetings provides a venue for a range of scientific communities to discuss these sometimes-controversial topics, toward development of a common and well-grounded scientific understanding.

Spatial probability is concerned with the investigation of large-scale random structures extended in space-time.  Disordered systems are a natural setting to describe phenomena with multiple equilibrium states, a situation that now appears to be the norm rather than an exception.  Regarding applications to socio-economic systems, the main theme will be strongly interacting agent based models, which are extensions of the McFadden Discrete Choice theory (Nobel Prize in Economy, 2000).  Specific models to be discussed include: Polymer models and self-interacting walks; random walks in a (dynamically evolving) random environment; two-dimensional models scaling to stochastic Loewner evolution; random graphs, from the simple Poissonian degree distribution to the scale-free; the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model; the Edwards-Anderson model; branching/coagulation processes; directed polymers in random environment in 1+1 dimensions; and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.<br/><br/>The program website is http://www.ihp.fr/en/CEB/T1-2015"

Despite their importance and usefulness in engineering and science, a complete theory establishing properties of solutions of these equations continues to be elusive. With applications to physical and biological sciences and aeronautical and naval engineering, the mechanism for energy transfer and dissipation governing fluid motions remain carefully concealed from the current methods to analyze these equations. The dramatic improvements in efficiency attained in aircraft, naval and automotive design, serve as testimony of the economic and societal impact of improved control of basic processes modeled by these equations.<br/><br/>In recent years problems in the study of differential equations in general, and in particularly of the Navier-Stokes equations, have given rise to interesting probabilisticstructures. The current project aims to elucidate the relation between properties of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with properties of a class of branching Markov chains naturally associated to these equations.   As well-illustrated by considering self-similar solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, regularity properties as well as uniqueness of solutions corresponds to properties of a specific branching Markov chain in which the branching nodes have a law determined by the invariance of the Navier-Stokes equations under spatial dilation (with a corresponding time scale change) and rotations.  This intrinsic branching structure motivates the formulation of an explosion problem that it is of interest in its own right from the probability point of view. It involves new considerations of the location of the left most particle of the branching process. Furthermore, the branching structure establishes a striking connection between nonlinear PDE's and branching processes that is the object of study in this proposal. A further specific objective of this proposal is to explore the consequences on the branching structure imposed by the incompressible character of the velocity field.  Specifically, the Fourier transform of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations can be represented as an expected value of a multiplicative functional defined on the nodes of the alluded branching Markov chain that reflects the incompressibility of the velocity field.  An objective of this proposal is to develop the implications for energy depletion as a consequence of the algebraic structure defined by the indicated multiplication operation. Likewise, regularity and large time behavior of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation can also be gleaned from this representation.  The proposal  also involves methods of graph theory, with the use of semi-algebraic sets in the classification of nodes of random trees.  Ultimately, this proposal seeks to elucidate the role of incompressibility in the multiplicative stochastic processes associated with equations of fluid flow."

The theories of random dynamical systems and stochastic differential equations provide fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling, analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena. The associated research, ranging from pure to applied, is extremely broad, with many active groups in the U.S. and abroad. The summer school will treat key topics related to the theory and application of stochastic differential equations, in particular, to turbulent flow simulations: Malliavin calculus,  Monte Carlo methods, multiscale models, molecular dynamics, stochastic methods for turbulent flows, porous media, weather prediction, and uncertainty quantification. The summer school will serve as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research among different research groups.

The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena."

The purpose of this project is to make significant progress towards developing a theory of the exact solvability of the KPZ equation. In particular, this theory should lead to exact formulas for the probability distributions of the solution to the KPZ equation when started with various important types of initial data. This project will involve a number of fields of mathematics and this direction has already produced results of independent interest to these fields, which include: Macdonald symmetric function theory, tropical combinatorics and Whittaker functions, and certain quantum integrable systems.<br/> <br/>Since its discovery two hundred years ago the Gaussian distribution (bell curve) has come to represent one of mathematics greatest societal and scientific contributions ? a robust theory explaining and analyzing much of the randomness inherent in the world. Physical and mathematical systems accurately described in terms of Gaussian statistics are said to be in the Gaussian universality class. This class, however, is not all encompassing. For example, classical extreme value statistics or Poisson statistics better capture the randomness and severity of events ranging from natural disasters to emergency room visits. More recently, significant research efforts have been focused on understanding systems which are not well-described in terms of any of the classically developed statistics. The failure of these systems to conform to classical descriptions is generally due to a non-linear relationship between natural observables and underlying sources of random inputs and noise. A variety of models for complex systems such as growth processes, polymer chains, mass transport, traffic flow, queueing theory, driven gases, and turbulence have been actively studied for over forty years in mathematics, physics, material science, chemistry and biology. All of these systems fail to conform with classical Gaussian statistics, as has been observed through experimental evidence involving turbulent liquid crystals, crystal growth on a thin film, facet boundaries, bacteria colony growth, paper wetting, crack formation, and burning fronts. Surprisingly, despite their differences, all of the systems fall into a new statistical universality class whose properties are described in terms of a single model called the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The purpose of this project is to develop a statistical understand of the KPZ equation and its universality class."

The study of card shuffling  procedures provides an entertaining yet complex and mathematically interesting example. It also serves as a model for the many important mixing phenomena. We use randomness to understand complex phenomena, from the behavior of polymer molecules and DNA analysis, to image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, and the behavior of financial markets. Random processes are also used as important tools for efficient computations. In all these cases, there are strong structural constraints underlying the behavior of the relevant random process. These constraints are expressed in terms of the environment of the process which often has a complex combinatorial or geometric  structure. This proposal focuses on the study of the fundamental properties of such stochastic processes and on how they relate to the global structure of their environment.<br/><br/>Many basic Markov processes evolve on a state space carrying a related geometric structure. Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold,  random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups and  finite Markov chains on complex combinatorial structures such as trees or matchings are significant examples. This proposal focuses on the relationships between the behavior of such  processes and the properties of the underlying geometric structure. It involves problems at the interface between analysis, geometry and probability with a major role played by groups and their actions. Potential theory, i.e., the study of harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation, is also at the center of many of these considerations."

Despite their importance and usefulness in engineering and science, a complete theory establishing properties of solutions of these equations continues to be elusive. With applications to physical and biological sciences and aeronautical and naval engineering, the mechanism for energy transfer and dissipation governing fluid motions remain carefully concealed from the current methods to analyze these equations. The dramatic improvements in efficiency attained in aircraft, naval and automotive design, serve as testimony of the economic and societal impact of improved control of basic processes modeled by these equations.<br/><br/>In recent years problems in the study of differential equations in general, and in particularly of the Navier-Stokes equations, have given rise to interesting probabilisticstructures. The current project aims to elucidate the relation between properties of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with properties of a class of branching Markov chains naturally associated to these equations.   As well-illustrated by considering self-similar solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, regularity properties as well as uniqueness of solutions corresponds to properties of a specific branching Markov chain in which the branching nodes have a law determined by the invariance of the Navier-Stokes equations under spatial dilation (with a corresponding time scale change) and rotations.  This intrinsic branching structure motivates the formulation of an explosion problem that it is of interest in its own right from the probability point of view. It involves new considerations of the location of the left most particle of the branching process. Furthermore, the branching structure establishes a striking connection between nonlinear PDE's and branching processes that is the object of study in this proposal. A further specific objective of this proposal is to explore the consequences on the branching structure imposed by the incompressible character of the velocity field.  Specifically, the Fourier transform of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations can be represented as an expected value of a multiplicative functional defined on the nodes of the alluded branching Markov chain that reflects the incompressibility of the velocity field.  An objective of this proposal is to develop the implications for energy depletion as a consequence of the algebraic structure defined by the indicated multiplication operation. Likewise, regularity and large time behavior of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation can also be gleaned from this representation.  The proposal  also involves methods of graph theory, with the use of semi-algebraic sets in the classification of nodes of random trees.  Ultimately, this proposal seeks to elucidate the role of incompressibility in the multiplicative stochastic processes associated with equations of fluid flow."

Such data sets typically arise in applied and foundational probability theory and are the starting point for questions in (topological) data analysis,  network theory, as well as surface estimation.   How does one use a data set to infer properties about a deterministic surface? How does one use a data set to draw conclusions about the objects generating the data? What is the size, dimension, and entropy of the object producing the data?  Does the data have `extreme' points and  outliers, and if so, how many?   What are the geometric properties of random networks which model real world phenomena?  Are the networks connected and are they `efficient'?  Up to now, the study of large data sets has largely assumed spatial independence of the underlying point sets, where already the questions in this setting are as challenging as they are important.  We propose to study such models, but also the  more realistic models where points are not assumed independent.   This would encompass  structures frequently encountered in physics,  computer science,  and operations research. <br/><br/>Questions arising in stochastic geometry and applied geometric probability  are often understood in terms of  the behavior of statistics of large random geometric structures, where `large' means that the randomness involves a  growing  number of random variables.  Problems involving these  structures involve understanding the behavior of spatially dependent terms having short range interactions, but complicated long range dependence.  Random geometric structures arise in diverse settings and include these fundamental examples: <br/>(i)  Point processes of dependent points, including those with determinantal, Gibbsian, or Markov random field structure, zeros of Gaussian analytic functions and zeros of solutions of the stochastic Burgers' equation, <br/>(ii)  Simplicial complexes in topological data analysis, <br/>(iii) Geometric networks and geometric graphs on random vertex sets, including those arising in data fusion networks  and nearest neighbor graphs  used in discerning intrinsic dimension and entropy of data clouds, <br/>(iv) Random surfaces which consistently estimate a target surface, <br/>(v)  Random polytopes generated by random data.

Statistical physicists and probabilists often try to understand the macroscopic behavior of systems consisting of many microscopic random inputs, which can give rise to interfaces between two phases at a critical temperature, such as water and ice at zero degree Celsius. This can be modeled via the scaling limit behavior (macroscopic behavior) of discrete lattice models (microscopic inputs) in critical cases. Oded Schramm's SLE (Stochastic Loewner Evolution) processes have led mathematicians and physicists to a clean and novel understanding of the scaling limits of the interfaces in discrete models in two dimensions. And CLE (Conformal Loop Ensemble) is the generalization of SLE which is predicted to be the scaling limit of the collection of all interfaces in discrete models. This research focuses on CLE and its relation between Gaussian Free Field, Liouville Quantum Gravity, and Random Maps.<br/><br/>Precisely, the research considers the following two problems.<br/>(1) The conformally invariant metric on CLE. Since the introduction of SLE and CLE, CLE(4) has been proved to be the scaling limit of the collection of level lines of discrete Gaussian Free Field. In the previous work of the principal investigator, a time parameter is constructed for CLE(4) loop configurations, and a coupling between Gaussian Free Field and CLE(4) with time parameter is given. The research aims to show that the time parameter defined on CLE(4) is in fact a deterministic function of the loop configuration. This result would deepen understanding of the relation between Gaussian Free Field and CLE.<br/>(2) CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity. Liouville Quantum Gravity is conjectured to be the scaling limit of random maps. The research project first aims to understand CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and then to explore the relation between CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and loop-decorated random maps."
