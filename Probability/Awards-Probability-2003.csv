We propose to study stochastic partial differential equations with a Gaussian random potential. There are many examples of such equations, and usually they are treated on a case-by-case basis. On the other hand, in many cases the solution can be expanded in terms of multiple stochastic integrals with respect to the noise. There are many tools available to study such equations, including Wiener space analysis and the Feynman-Kac formula. We intend to use these tools to study qualitative properties of solutions, such as asymptotic growth, and the critical parameters for existence of solutions. For certain parameter values, we expect solutions taking values in the space of Schwartz distributions. Of course, this is a broad program, and many such equations have been considered before. However, much less is known for the case of correlated Gaussian noise than for white noise. Here, we are referring to specific phenomena, which might occur only for certain correlation functions of the Gaussian noise. Also, the stochastic heat equation has received much more attention than other cases. <br/> In the physical sciences, engineering, and increasingly in biology, the most useful tool is a partial differential equation. Solving the equation gives us a quantitative understanding of the physical situation, allowing us to make predictions and to control the system. However, in the real world, all systems are affected by random noise, and our models must also include randomness. The field of stochastic partial differential equations attempts to address this situation. This field is much newer than partial differential equations, and our mathematical understanding is much less. This proposal focuses on equations with a potential term. Such equations model many natural phenomena. In quantum mechanics, potential terms represent the interaction between particles and forces acting on the system. Potential terms can also arise in the equations for the spread of epidemics, and in other situations in population biology. We will study the effect of a random potential. The goal is to increase our understanding of the mathematical tools, so that scientists and engineers can use them more skillfully. <br/>"

More precisely, one looks at random walks on the d-dimensional lattice, whose transition probabilities form a random field indexed by the vertices of the lattice. Not only is the RWRE providing a serious mathematical challenge, many of the results proved in this field, especially in the one dimensional case, stand in sharp contrast with the behavior of classical random walk. For example, in dimension 1, subdiffusive behavior and aging phenomena are present, whereas in high dimension one may construct RWREs with nonzero (averaged) local drift pointing in one direction while the walk drifts away (with positive speed) in the opposite direction. Some of the mathematical challenge emanates from the fact that in the multidimensional case, conditioned on the transition probabilities random field, the RWRE is not reversible. This precludes the use of much of the available theory of homogenization, and requires the development of new techniques, most notably through the use of regeneration times and of renormalization ideas. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers including Sznitman, Varadhan, and Zerner, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Among these one notes the existence of 0-1 laws, laws of large numbers in full generality, transience and recurrence criteria, the relation between quenched and annealed large deviations behavior, the existence (or non-existence) of sub-diffusive behavior for high dimension, and the behavior of RWREs in mixing (as opposed to i.i.d.) environments. <br/> Random walks are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such RWREs can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow one to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWREs can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place. <br/>"

The first is concerned with Harnack inequalities. A Harnack inequality asserts that nonnegative solutions to a partial differential equation satisfy certain boundedness estimates at points, and thus allow one to obtain pointwise estimates from global information. They are used in partial differential equations to obtain estimates on heat kernels and to prove regularity properties of solutions. They are used in probability to obtain transition density estimates and regularity properties of certain stochastic processes. The principal investigator will investigate when one can obtain Harnack inequalities for functions related to non-local operators. The operators in question have an integral term and correspond to processes with jumps. The second area of research concerns uniqueness for the solutions of stochastic differential equations arising from population models in mathematical biology. These equations describe the limit of branching diffusion processes as the number of particles increases, the mass of each particle decreases, and the branching rate increases. The branching rate and the diffusion mechanism for a particle are allowed to depend on all other particles in the system. Branching diffusions are used as models of population dynamics for a large variety of species. The equations that result are typically either infinite dimensional, degenerate, or both. The principal investigator will continue his work on proving uniqueness for these equations. <br/> It has been known for a long time that many systems in the physical and biological sciences can be modeled by stochastic processes. More recently it has been discovered that many financial and economic systems can also be so modeled. To investigate more complex systems, new types of random processes have arisen. To give an example, stock prices are often viewed as depending on a continuous random process, Brownian motion. Yet the fluctuations of stock prices often have sudden jumps, resulting from wars, new discoveries, etc. Thus it is essential to also study stochastic processes with jumps. When studying population models, one expects that the behavior of the population will be qualitatively different depending on whether the population is large or whether it is small. The research of the principal investigator is primarily concerned with two types of stochastic processes, ones with jumps, as in the stock market example, and ones concerning systems that can degenerate, as in the population example. Some of the questions that are being investigated are whether there is only one solution to the equation and whether the solution has sufficient regularity to be useful in providing new information for the model. <br/>"

The questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions of the SDEs and smoothness<br/>of solutions will be studied. Then the solutions will be used to construct and study heat kernel measures (a noncommutative analogue of Gaussian or Wiener measure) on the infinite-dimensional manifolds. In general these infinite-dimensional groups are not locally compact and therefore do not have a Haar measure. The PI intends to study Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance of these measures. It is an interesting questions in itself, but it also can give rise to unitary representations of the infinite-dimensional groups.  It is proposed to study properties of square-integrable holomorphic functions. For example, quasi-invariance can be used to prove weak Cauchy-Riemann equations for holomorphic functions. Besides the classical infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis the PI intends to study noncommutative SDEs.<br/><br/> The proposed research is motivated by several subjects. Infinite-dimensional spaces such as loop groups and path spaces appear in physics, for example, in quantum field theory and string theory.

Since the complexity and heterogeneity of these networks usually preclude exact analysis, the focus here is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation are considered: first order (functional law of large numbers) approximations called fluid models, and second order (functional central limit theorem) approximations, which are frequently diffusion models. The interplay between these two levels is an important subtheme throughout. Three main topics are addressed: (i) Dynamic scheduling for stochastic processing networks, (ii) Analysis of processor sharing networks, (iii) Congestion control for modern communication networks. The stochastic network models considered under these topics are considerably more general than conventional multiclass queueing networks operating under a head-of-the-line (HL) service discipline. Although there is a fairly well developed theory of stability and heavy traffic diffusion approximation for the latter, there are many challenging open problems associated with the control and analysis of the more general stochastic network models being studied here. Some of the stochastic process aspects are that topic (i) involves the analysis and interpretation of the solution of an approximating constrained diffusion control problem, topic (ii) uses measure-valued processes to keep track of residual service times of all jobs in the network, and topic (iii) involves reflected Levy processes when document sizes have heavy tails. <br/> This grant funds research on mathematical problems motivated by applications in the disciplines of operations research, computer science and electrical engineering. Specifically, problems associated with the control and analysis of stochastic networks are being studied. Such networks are used as models for complex manufacturing, telecommunications and computer systems. Two fundamental problems for such networks are (a) to understand the effects of common policies on congestion and delay, and (b) to design 'good' controllers for these systems. The networks under study are substantially more general than those that have been rigorously studied to date. Through their complexity and heterogeneity, these networks present challenging mathematical problems. The project involves the development of new theory for stochastic processes and uses techniques from a variety of mathematical disciplines. Collaborations with researchers familiar with areas of application and the training of graduate student researchers are integral parts of the project. <br/>"

Study of nonequilibrium stationary states for systems in classical mechanics coupled to heat reservoirs, - in particular the study of stochastic partial differential equations arising from a model of semilinear wave equations coupled to one or several reservoirs described by linear wave equations at positive temperature. The goal is to prove existence and uniqueness of the stationary state, determine the rate of convergence and study the transport properties of the system. 2. Development of probabilistic methods to study the ergodic properties of open quantum systems coupled to reservoirs of bosons and fermions - in particular investigating and developing tools to study the ergodic properties of quantum Markov semigroups and quantum stochastic differential equations and combining them with spectral methods to prove ergodic properties for open quantum systems. 3. Develop the study of large deviations in quantum statistical mechanics - in particular prove the large deviation principle for the Gibbs-KMS states of quantum systems on a lattice (quantum spin systems, fermionic and bosonic lattice gases). <br/> Statistical mechanics is the physical and mathematical theory, which attempts to link the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. At the microscopic level, atoms or elementary particles are described by the time reversible laws of Newtonian or Quantum mechanics, which involve a huge number of equations. At the macroscopic level, materials are, in their normal state, described, by a few parameters or equations, such as pressure, temperature, electrical and thermal conductivity, etc. Some fundamental problems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics remain poorly understood, both at the conceptual and mathematical level: for example the characterization of nonequilibrium stationary states of open systems and the derivation of phenomenological transport laws from microscopic mechanical models (for example, the Ohm's law of electric and Fourier's law of heat conduction). The proposal addresses some of these questions, which are related for example to material sciences. Also a new field, loosely speaking ``quantum probability'', has emerged in the last few years, driven by applications such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing. The proposal is also devoted to the study of several mathematical tools in this field. <br/>"

In the kinetic limit, the phase space distribution of a solution to this equation converges to a linear Boltzmann equation. Beyond the kinetic scale, one expects that the Boltzmann equation is still correct in dimension three or higher provided that the diffusivity is renormalized. The first project aims to study this renormalization for time scales longer than the kinetic scale. The second project concerns the viscosity of the lattice gas models. Recently the PI has established the divergence rate for the diffusion coefficient for the asymmetric simple exclusion process in dimension two. The goal of this project is to extend this result to the dimension one case and to the lattice gas models with the Navier-Stokes equation as the formal limit. <br/> The fundamental question regarding the conductivity of electrons in semiconductors is how conduction occurs. As the technology is reaching the stage that the semi-classical theory no longer applies, the quantum effect will dominate and a mathematical rigorous theory is of fundamental importance. The first project aims to establish the quantum corrections of the standard semi-classical theory based on the Boltzmann equation. This will provide the first rigorous understanding of these quantum dynamical effects. The second project investigates the validity of the lattice gas models for fluids. These models, besides being widely used to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations, are important models for non-equilibrium statistical physics. The goal here is to establish the divergence rate of the viscosity for these models. This will give the first clue concerning how well the Navier-Stokes equation models the two-dimensional fluid. <br/>"

The goal of the proposed research is to look at certain complicated systems with the above features. The investigation is roughly divided into three components. One part of the investigation will focus on the interaction of discontinuities with the above ideas.

The first is the large deviations analysis of occupancy models.  Occupancy models provide a simple, generic probabilistic construct that has found use in many fields.  The proposed large deviations approach is different from and complementary to much of the previous analysis of such models.  Motivated by problems from both wired and wireless communications, the research program will develop explicitly computable large deviation asymptotic approximations, and will also develop methods such as importance sampling to provide accurate results even in the non-asymptotic regime.  The second topic is the design of stochastic adaptive algorithms for mobile communication.  This area of application is narrower in scope, being of particular interest to engineers of next generation, high-rate wireless access systems. However, within that scope, the activities are general and fundamental in nature. The emphasis here is on the development of methods for the analysis of scheduling algorithms in wireless, and on the development of new algorithms.<br/>  This project will develop mathematical methods for two important areas in modern telecommunication, with an emphasis on a broad university/industrial training of graduate students.  A key component of the research program is the joint supervision of graduate students between Bell Labs and Brown University.  For the graduate students that are involved, there will be summer internships at Lucent Technologies, which will supplement the more traditional training in a number of ways.  Both research areas of focus, namely occupancy models and wireless scheduling, are challenging intellectual problems that are motivated by developing commercial technology.  In addition to working with specific industrial mentors, the students also have the opportunity to attend talks, seminars and generally benefit from exposure to a wide variety of current problems and solution methods whose development is in progress.  The proposed collaborative research and associated seminar series will help to strengthen the ties between Bell Labs and Brown University, invigorating the intellectual climate at both institutions.  The goal of the proposed research is to provide solid, fundamental mathematical foundations for solving problems of current interest, in a framework that will likely be applicable to problems of the future. <br/> <br/>"

The investigator's research concerns stochastic models associated with the evolution of dilute gases, coagulation-fragmentation phenomenon and the formation of solids. As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. In the case of a dilute gas, one shows that after a suitable scaling, the particle density converges to a solution of the Boltzmann equation. In the case of the coagulation-fragmentation phenomenon, the rescaled microscopic particle density converges to a solution of the Smoluchowski equation. As a model of a crystal, one may consider an inhomogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation with viscosity. After a suitable scaling, the solutions converge to solutions of homogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Probabilistically, such a convergence is a law of large numbers and its corresponding central limit theorem and large deviation principle provide us with some vital information about the microscopic model under the study. <br/> Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move erratically without any particular aim. However these molecules manage to organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale. The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids, gases and solids. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting particles is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of fluids and gases. Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient way of simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases. <br/>"

In the area of asymptotic enumeration, he will obtain approximations to coefficients of multivariate meromorphic generating functions that are asymptotically valid as the multi-index goes to infinity in any possible way.  The ultimate goal is to automate this procedure, at least for the class of (multivariate) rational generating functions with nonnegative coefficients. Previous results indicate this may be feasible, or at least may be carried out to some extent.  These results are to be applied to several combinatorial problems in probability theory, including asymptotics for random tilings for the so-called Aztec Diamond configurations and other related tiling ensembles conjectured to produce polynomial phase boundaries.  In the area of random processes with reinforcement, he will investigate the rate at which processes of stochastic approximation type converge to their ultimate limiting behavior.  In particular, the slow convergence of vertex-reinforced random walks and uniformly reinforced social network models to their limits is to be explained by giving quantitative bounds on the probabilities of deviating from this behavior at finite times.  It is hoped that this will both explain simulation data and give a theoretical basis for the use of these models.  Among the other miscellaneous problems are several problems in economic game theory and one concerning asymptotics of solutions to functional equations.<br/><br/> Recent progress in computer algebra has made many types of computation automated which once were done only by skilled practitioners.  Nowadays, a few messy equations are no barrier at all to a complete theoretical and practical understanding of a problem.  The most tangible result of the asymptotic enumeration project will be the transformation of a formerly difficult type of computation into a straightforward, though messy, series of steps.  Applications reach far beyond the motivating examples of random tilings, and include queuing theory, signal processing and combinatorial enumeration.  Reinforcement processes arise most commonly in three application areas:  formal models of learning, population biology, and economic behavior. In each of these areas, the results of the project will shed light on when and why the theoretically predicted limiting behaviors are not observed in the timeframes of real applications.<br/>"

These include: (1) Problems concerning `hot-spots' properties for the survival time probabilities of Brownian motion which is killed on part of the boundary of a domain and reflected on the rest; (2) Problems concerning the `fine' spectral theoretic properties of symmetric stable processes, such as variational characterization for eigenvalues, properties of nodal lines, geometric, analytic and probabilistic properties of finite dimensional distributions as a function of the starting point; and (3) Optimal problems that arise from studying the Beurling-Ahlfors singular integral operator using space-time Brownian motion. Solutions to the 'hot-spots' problems will lead to further progress on the celebrated 'hot-spots' conjecture of J. Rauch which asserts that the maximum and minimum of ground state Neumann eigenfunctions are attained only at boundary points. Many of the proposed problems for stable processes are motivated by their well known counterparts for Brownian motion. However, some of the questions for stable processes in turn lead to problems which will provide new information even for Brownian motion. Since the techniques for the Brownian motion results do not apply, new techniques must be developed for these problems. Such techniques are likely to lead to new and unexpected applications in other areas particularly for other stochastic processes with jumps but whose transition probabilities still retain certain rotational invariance properties. Martingales have played an important role in the study of singular integral operators in general and in the study of Beurling-Ahlfors operator in particular. A new probabilistic approach, based on heat martingales, is proposed. This will give a better understanding of a celebrated conjecture of T. Iwaniec on the size of the norm of this operator. <br/> A remarkable aspect of contemporary mathematics is the unexpected yet deep connections between previously very different fields. The problems in the proposed project are all interdisciplinary in nature and as such have the potential to impact different fields in mathematics, engineering, science and economics. Symmetric stable processes have been used to model many physical and economic phenomena, particularly for certain stocks where the Brownian motion models are not adequate. Estimates on the Beurling-Ahlfors operator have many applications to nonlinear problems in elasticity. The 'hot-spots' conjecture, when formulated in terms of the theory of heat conduction, asserts that if one begins with an initial heat distribution on a plate which is insulated around its boundary and waits for the initial transients to settle down, then the hottest and coldest regions will be found on the boundary of the plate. Since the mathematical description of heat is given by a second order partial differential operator, introduced by the Marquis Pierre-Simon De Laplace (1749-1827) more than 200 years ago, the conjecture has been of interest to researchers in mathematics, physics and chemistry. The connection to probability arises from the description by Norbert Wiener (1894-1964) of heat flow in terms of Brownian motion. <br/>"

The rigorous study of these models is still in its infancy, and the main goal of this proposal is to pursue it. Two of the specific goals are to obtain a better understanding of the low-temperature phase of the p-spin interaction model, and to start the study of the new Hamiltonians introduced by F. Guerra in his broken replica-symmetry bound for the Sherrington Kirkpatrick model. <br/> One of the central themes of probability theory is the emergence of a kind of order out of large number of random events. This is expressed by classical theorems, such as the law of large numbers. These classical results relate to situations where the random events are independent, that is, the outcome of one does not influence the outcome of the others. Such an assumption is unrealistic in practice. We investigate the emergence of new types of collective behavior in large collections of random events, where each event can, and will, influence the outcome of the others. The specific mathematical models have been motivated by the behavior of magnetized particles, and are known as ""spin glasses"". <br/>"

The main targets in this research are the ergodic behavior and the relaxation patterns of several interacting particle systems, including Ising models, contact processes and other lattice spin systems. Percolation theory is also a major component of this research, because of its close relations to the processes indicated above and its simplicity, which makes it a paradigm in the study of probabilistic models with many components. Part of the research addresses the study of the above mentioned processes on arbitrary graphs -- an important current trend in the area. Several of the problems have their motivation in phenomena observed in nature as, for example, phase transitions, critical behavior, metastable behavior of systems in the vicinity of phase transition regions and domain formation and growth.<br/> On an informal and broad level one can see the objects of interest in this research in the following fashion. A system contains a large number of similar components and each component interacts in a simple way with a few other ones, which are near to it in some sense. For instance one can think of the atoms in a crystal interacting when they are close enough, or individuals in a large population which may suffer or not from some infection with contamination occurring between neighbors. The local interaction may involve a substantial amount of randomness, but since the system as a whole is large, one expects and indeed observes a much more predictable behavior at the global level. A great deal of interest in such systems stems from the fact that the qualitative behavior of the whole system may depend in non-trivial ways on parameters which are built into the local interactions, but which only affect those in a smooth way (e.g., the rate of infection between neighboring individuals in our second example above). The general issues of interest are then the understanding of which sort of equilibria can be reached by such types of stochastic dynamics, how an equilibrium state is reached, and how the parameters which affect the local rules may affect the answers to these questions. <br/>"

One collection of problems involves the stationary distributions for exclusion processes with drift in both one and higher dimensions. Recent work of the investigator showed the existence of stationary blocking measures in one dimension under weak assumptions. The next set of problems concerns the existence of nonblocking stationary profile measures in one dimension and of nonreversible stationary blocking measures in higher dimensions -- in neither case are there any known examples. Other problems involve (a) connections between the symmetric exclusion process and negative dependence, (b) the extent to which the known theory of the symmetric exclusion process extends to processes with a few asymmetries, (c) the analysis of some infinite systems motivated by the investigator's recent work on a class of models in sociology, and (d) the computation of the critical values for a family of reversible growth models on homogeneous trees. <br/> Many problems in the natural and social sciences involve the behavior of large numbers of individuals (people, molecules, cars, viruses, etc.) that interact in unpredictable ways. This lack of predictability is modeled by randomness. One of the fundamental contributions of probability theory in the past century is the realization that large populations display a significant amount of predictability and order in spite of the lack of predictability of the actions of the individuals in the population. This project is aimed at gaining a better understanding of several models of this general type. Among them are: (a) the exclusion process, which models particle motion, traffic flow, and the behavior of ribosomes in biology, (b) certain growth models that are partly motivated by tumor growth and conflicts between competing populations, and (c) models from sociology, in which relationships among individuals are altered by the exchange of gifts or rewards. In each case, the objective is to determine the long time behavior of the system. <br/>"

There are six individual projects, all of which they have already analyzed to some degree. The first project concerns an approach to a general theory of discontinuous phase transitions. For a certain class of nearest neighbor attractive systems on the usual d-dimensional cubic lattices they can show that whenever the associated mean field theory predicts a discontinuous phase transition, the actual system also undergoes a discontinuous transition whenever the dimension d is large. The second project is a proposal to study a model which emulates, through a deterministic evolution of a random environment, the celebrated SOC sandpile models. Third, they study systems at points of phase coexistence in a statistical ensemble fixing the excess of the minority phase in the system. It appears that, in a correct scaling, there is a sharp value of minority-phase volume where a droplet of the minority phase spontaneously emerges. Fourth, they will investigate certain percolation systems which locally appear similar to percolation on the complete graph but contain an underlying geometrical structure that is absent in the usual complete graph systems. In the fifth project, they will study a variety of interacting random walks with both attractive and repulsive (and mixed) interactions. The final project concerns the correct definition of thermodynamic limit of the free energy in polydisperse systems, e.g., systems with a continuum of particle species. <br/> The Principal Investigators will be examining a number of problems (six in the proposal with more on the horizon) in the area of Statistical Mechanics or closely related fields. The essence of these problems concerns systems consisting of simple constituents which interact in a simple manner. However, since there are a myriad of these constituents it turns out that such systems are capable of highly complex behavior. Of particular interest is the phenomena of phase transitions in which the entire collective character of the system undergoes a drastic change. This notion is either at the heart of or just behind the scenes in all of the systems that are proposed for study. One project concerns a demonstration that ""most"" systems undergo a more catastrophic sort of transition sometimes known as a phase change of the first kind. A second line of investigation concerns the formation of droplets (e.g. raindrops) which, as it turns out, takes place on a submacroscopic scale known as a mesoscopic scale. Third, under investigation is the infiltration of ""disturbances"" in a system which -- from one perspective -- models a social network. Fourth, there will be investigations of systems in which the above mentioned elementary constituents are all of different (but closely related) character. The remainder of the investigations concern the so called percolation and random walk systems. While these models have their origins in the study of chemical polymers, the applications cover a large range of topics, one of which, in modern terms, is the dissemination of information in communications networks. <br/>"

There are three directions in the proposed research: Wiener Chaos decomposition for linear and nonlinear equation, analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in domains, and statistical inference for stochastic partial differential equations. Wiener Chaos decomposition is a stochastic analog of the classical Fourier method and is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic equations, from both analytical and numerical points of view. In particular, Wiener Chaos decomposition is the key component of several new numerical algorithms for nonlinear filtering and of an efficient computational procedure for statistical moments of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in domains is necessary for development of a complete theory, similar to the one for deterministic partial differential equations. In addition to purely theoretical results about existence and uniqueness of solutions, this analysis leads to new numerical methods for such equations. Methods of statistical inference make it possible to relate an abstract equation to a concrete problem from applications. Unlike finite-dimensional systems, a consistent estimation in a stochastic partial differential equation is possible even when both the observation time and the amplitude of noise are fixed.<br/> Stochastic partial differential equations are both an interesting mathematical object and an effective modeling tool in various branches of applied science, such as ecology, finance, meteorology, and navigation. Equations studied in this project can describe, for example, the term structure of interest rates, the propagation of an oil spill in the ocean, and the motion of the target on the radar screen. The research objectives of the project are to study mathematical properties of stochastic partial differential equations and to develop effective computational and statistical methods for relating an equation to a model. The educational objective of the project is to increase understanding of stochastic partial differential equations among the students and researchers both inside and outside of the mathematical community. This educational objective will be achieved by developing several basic and special topics courses and by organizing a research seminar on applications of stochastic partial differential equations."
