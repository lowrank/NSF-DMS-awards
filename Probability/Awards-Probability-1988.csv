The first problem involves the statistical inference                of a quantity called the extremal index, which is of importance                 to the statistical theory of extremes of dependent data.  The                   second problem involves the study of properties of a two-                       dimensional random measure which records the excursions of high                 levels by a continuous-time stationary process.  The third topic                involves the extremes of a shot noise process.  Applications to                 results will be considered.                                                          This investigator works in the field of probability, in the                area of extreme value theory.  He proposes to study three topics                which have been studied by many other researchers in this area.                 A successful completion of any of these projects will have                      positive impact on areas of application such as engineering and                 statistics."

The research in this project               centers on analogues of the hypergeometric functions in which the               argument is a matrix, rather than a real or complex number. The                 representation theory of the general linear group plays a major                 role in this investigation, because the generalized                             hypergeometric functions can be thought of as having for their                  domain of definition a certain quotient of that group.

The principal investigator                  will develop a general unifying theory based on semi-martingale                 integrators.  It is hoped that in the process, the traditional                  assumption of asymptotic quasi-left continuity can be dropped.                  This will make the theory much more applicable.  A particular                   application of interest is in finance theory for the extension of               the Black-Scholes model.                                                             The second part of the project will deal with defining                     stochastic integrals with anticipating integrands.  In                          traditional definition of stochastic integrals, the integrand                   (non-anticipating) is assumed to be dependent only on the past of               the process with respect to which the integral is carried out.                  This makes the convergence properties of the integrals easy to                  prove.  However, in many applications, such as in Volterra                      equations in Physics, the integrand cannot be assumed to be non-                anticipating.  The work will use many technical results that the                principal investigator has developed in the past."

The major motivation for the project is to create                  models to fit the hypothesis and then to use the acceptable                     models to predict the future behavior.  The classes of stochastic               processes to be studied have been shown as appropriate models for               analysis of allelic frequency data.  Measure-valued branching                   processes trace not only the numbers of particles but also their                distributions over the time.  Thus the measure-valued aspect of                 the processes make them particularly attractive models in                       epidemiological spread of communicable disease or economic wealth               of various populations.  Mathematically, the stochastic measure                 diffusion process is the continuous analogue of an infinite                     particle branching Markov system.  The project will address three               specific aspects of these processes: properties of the                          topological support of the associated random measure, including                 the coherence or dispersiveness, clustered nature or                            scatteredness, and singularity or absolute continuity of such                   random measures."
