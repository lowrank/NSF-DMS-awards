The first focusses on extremal problems involving (generalized)                 moment inequalities for sums of independent, symmetric random                   variables with an eye toward obtaining best constants.  The                     research builds on the classic inequalities of Khintchine and                   Rosenthal.  The from of the final inequalities should give some                 insight into the nature of cancellation phenomena and may suggest               extensions to more general dependence relations.  This work is                  ongoing and is joint work with T. Figiel, P. Hitczenko and W. B.                Johnson.  The second project concerns structural problems for U-                statistics and U-processes.  Gine and the principal investigator                have found very little information concerning necessity in the                  context of U-statistics.  Together with J. Cuzik, they have made                some progress on a very special case, but there is much more work               required to understand the general question of cancellation in                  this context.  Two other projects deal with trying to find usable               necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of functions to                 be uniform Donsker (with E. Gine) and studying questions                        concerning convergence rates in the context of bootstrapping                    empirical measures (with F. Gotze).                                                  The principal investigator is working on several projects                  whose primary focus is a better understanding of cancellation                   phenomena for sums of independent random variables.  These types                of problems often arise in statistics."

The first topic focusses primarily on instrumental variable                     estimation in generalized linear and nonlinear measurement error                regression models.  Inference methods to be studied include                     maximum likelihood, conditional likelihood and quasilikelihood                  estimation based on approximate data models.  The second topic                  involves comparison methods for tangent sequences of martingale                 differences.  Special attention will be given to problems                       involving domination of martingales by martingales with                         conditionally independent increments.

This research is focussed on two different topics.  The                    first area involves problems of inference and data analysis when                data are not measured precisely.  The second topic is concerned                 with comparison methods for sums of random variables.

He intends to address this problem via a method of                   time-reversal for diffusions.                                                        The principal investigator is studying certain properties of               stochastic differential equations (sde's), a type of equation                   which arises from the dynamics of a physical system which is                    subject to random fluctuations.  (A typical example of such a                   system is the position of an aircraft, whose motion is influenced               by erratic atmospheric conditions.)  Building on some of his                    previous work in this area, the reviewer intends to study the so                called quasi-invariance properties of solutions to sde's.  The                  quasi-invariance problem is related to quantum field theory and                 as such is also of interest to mathematical physicists."

These include: (a)                  development of the statistical applications of metrics and                      related orderings on permutations; (b) new and more efficient                   isotonic regression algorithms for partially ordered spaces; and                (c) various techniques for types of ordinal data analyses.

Among these are nonlinear                          autoregressive (-moving average) processes of much interest in                  time series analysis, and random perturbations of dynamical                     systems and flows which exhibit various phase transitions as a                  parameter changes.  The interplay between Markov processes and                  dynamical systems that this proposal explores has significant                   consequences to both fields.  For those Markov processes which                  approach a unique steady state as time progresses, a further                    object of study is the central limit theorem and its refinement                 by asymptotic expansions.  These refinements have applications in               diverse areas such as bootstrapping in time series, and singular                perturbation expansions of large time solutions of a class of                   partial differential equations which arise in the prediction of                 the spread of contaminants in an aquifer.                                            Random processes which occur in nature may often be regarded               as a deterministic system perturbed by random noise.  Just as the               nature of the deterministic part greatly influences the behavior                of the random process, the statistical behavior of the random                   process may also be used in predicting the large time behavior of               the deterministic system itself.  This latter study is                          particularly useful in analyzing complex deterministic systems                  such as those arising in the study of turbulence.  The present                  proposal seeks to explore this interplay between deterministic                  and random processes.  Another object is the refinement of                      precise statistical laws governing the long-run average behavior                of many important random phenomena.  Among diverse potential                    applications are bootstrapping in time series and the prediction                of the spread of contaminants in an aquifer."

Professor Dai's research will mainly                  focus on queueing networks, which arise from computer networks                  and manufacturing systems.  It includes justification of the                    Brownian approximation for multiclass queueing networks,                        understanding network performance when it is heavily loaded, and                computation of stationary distribution of a reflected Brownian                  motion.  The ultimate goal is to develop a robust set of computer               software tools that can accurately and efficiently predict the                  performance of a wide class of queueing networks.  Professor                    Hill's research includes: optimal stopping problems, especially                 order selection and minimax rules; partitioning or fair-division                problems in probability and statistics; one-sided limit laws and                probability bounds, especially for means and quantiles; and                     fusions of probabilities and their relationship to dilation,                    convex domination and martingales.                                                   The principal investigators will carry out research in both                theoretical and applied aspects of probability.  The more applied               topics include investigating the performance of queueing networks               (inter-connected service facilities populated by randomly                       arriving customers with random amounts of service requirements)                 which arise from computer networks and manufacturing systems, and               investigating optimal stopping theory (sequential analysis of                   time dependent random processes such as pollution levels in a                   city or stock prices).  At one extreme, this research is aimed at               developing practical computer software tools that can accurately                and efficiently predict the performance of a wide class of random               systems, and at the other extreme it is aimed at discovering new                basic mathematical theorems in abstract spaces and settings."

In                particular kernel estimation and related areas of nonparametric                 and density estimation applications will be studied, and the                    smoothing parameter selection problem addressed.  Problems to be                considered include those of discontinuities or rough density                    functions, selection for ridge regression, and the effect of                    discretization.  The modelling part of this project involves new                developments of the theory and applications of Markov models in                 both discrete and continuous time.  The investigator will                       concentrate on rates of convergence results and on state and                    history dependent criteria for such stability.  These results                   will be incorporated into a new approach to Markov decisions                    processes where the state space is extended to include the                      decision set into the overall Markovian structure.

Probabilistic modelling and statistical estimation                         techniques encompass two separate parts of the same activity.                   The first part endeavors to describe, in manageable terms, models               of real and often complex systems in such a way that the inherent               randomness in the system is properly represented.  The second                   endeavors to use these models, and data gathered to describe real               systems, in such a way that one can estimate the parameters that                actually describe what is happening in practice.  In the                        modelling part of this project the investigators will study                     important models in operations research, time series, and finance               and economics, with a focus on developing methods for stability                 of such systems.

Current research is directed towards                    understanding the stochastic behavior of matching functionals.                  This involves finding tight non-asymptotic bounds, limiting                     distributions, and exponential type moment bounds.  This would                  add to the understanding of several combinatorial optimization                  problems as well as empirical discrepancy problems, notably                     finding the rate of convergence of the empirical to the true                    distribution.  Results of this type are useful in stochastic                    bin-packing as well as statistical physics.  Concerning                         discrepancy problems in mathematical statistics, research is also               directed towards further enlarging the collection of known                      Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) classes of sets.  This involves                        establishing general connections between VC classes of positivity               sets, quantifier elimination theorems, and semi-algebraic                       geometry.                                                                            The proposed research will focus heavily on the theoretical                and mathematical aspects of the well-known transportation problem               as well as some of its generalizations.  This problem has                       received wide attention over the years and it is recognized that                a full understanding of its mathematical complexities will lead                 to more efficient and perhaps simpler ways to solve optimization                problems ranging from the shipping of goods, to the routing of                  airplanes and the study of statistical mechanics. In its simplest               and most elementary form the problem may be stated as follows.                  Suppose that one is given n oil wells and n refineries and wishes               to efficiently pair off wells and refineries, so as to minimize                 the sum of the matching distances.  It is easy to see that there                are n| different possible matchings.  The transportation problem                is to determine the most efficient matching, i.e., to determine                 that matching which will minimize the sum of the distances. The                 proposed research will consider variations on this and related                  problems."

Related problems               can be proposed for either this model or its appropriate                        variations such as simple exclusions with speed change or the                   Ginzburg-Landau model.

An important task in statistical mechanics is to derive the                evolution of a fluid from its molecular structure.  At the                      molecular level, a fluid consists of a large number of molecules                moving according to physical laws.  Microscopically, molecules                  collide incessantly and move somewhat erratically in a random                   like fashion.  Due to conservation laws of mass, momentum and                   entropy, molecules manage to organize themselves in such a way as               to form a flow pattern on a large scale.  Various Caricature                    models of a fluid will be studied to derive their macroscopic                   evolution from their microscopic structure in a mathematically                  rigorous fashion."

One problem will be to find a                    relationship between the size of the largest step of a random                   walk and the recurrence of the random walk.  Another will be to                 try to extend the asymptotic likelihood theory of Hoffman-                      Jorgensen to nonparametric and semiparametric problems.                              This award provides support for graduate students.  The                    award will help develop the infrastructure of basic mathematical                research in the area of statistics and probability."

Some of the aspects of gene amplification to be                      considered are integration of extrachromosomal fragments, unequal               chromatid exchange, and variable length of repeats in telomeres                 at the ends of chromosomes.  The mathematical models to be used                 will include branching processes and random walks.  The models                  will be used to estimate the probabilities and transition rates                 of the events.
