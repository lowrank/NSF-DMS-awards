He will study existence,                        uniqueness and regularity problems for compact and noncompact                   complete hypersurfaces with prescribed curvature functions. The                 emphasis is placed on the analytic approach based on a study of                 corresponding questions for Monge-Ampere equations. As a part of                this research variational problems for nonlinear elliptic                       equations will also be investigated.

These involve the application of the theory of dynamical                systems to digital circuits and a study of the dynamical systems                on finite state spaces which arise from approximations of                       continuous systems. Richard Moeckel's work will be concerned with               an investigation of collisions and of rejection to infinity in                  the three body problem, a study of central configurations in the                n-body problem, and an investigation of normal forms near                       elliptic fixed points of mechanical systems.                                         The research on finite approximation of continuous dynamical               systems recognises the fact that computer experiments can                       necessarily only reveal approximations of the original continuous               system. The focus of attention will be on questions asking                      whether the properties of attractors of the original system are                 faithfully exhibited on the video screen. McGehee's other project               is to study the mathematical idealizations of the digital and                   analog levels of hardware and develop a theory of how digital                   devices can be derived from analog circuits.                                         Moeckel's work will continue studies of periodic points and                invariant curves of area preserving maps, of homoclinic phenomena               and of normal forms. These investigations are all aimed towards                 an understanding of the possible qualitative behaviors of three                 point masses. The study of central configurations is important in               the context of escape to infinity, multiple collisions, and the                 topology of energy surfaces."

The first                   concerns the development of Krasnosel'skii - type (Helly - type)                theorems which determine whether a set S is finitely starlike,                  while the second concerns the development of theorems which                     reveal the measures of the F - stars in S for F any finite subset               of S.                                                                                   This is a very basic area of geometric research.  It is                 expected that graduate students working in this area will be                    prepared for work in many other areas of research as well,                      building on the fine program in geometry already in place at                    Oklahoma."

He will attempt to extend the                   theory of Riemann surfaces with nodes to surfaces of infinite                   Poincare area. This is connected with the study of infinite                     dimensional deformation spaces and moduli spaces which are                      currently of interest to string theorists.

The objective is to deform this                  metric in such way as to obtain one of positive sectional                       curvature.

These                    concern oscillatory integrals in Fourier analysis and the                       connections between string theory and Riemann surfaces. The                     former comprises an investigation of the role of geometry in the                study of singular kernels. The latter will be a continuation of                 earlier work in which Phong, together with collaborators, has                   identified the scattering amplitudes of strings with the Weil-                  Peterson measure on the moduli space.

This is a topic which has rapidly moved                  into the forefront of research into the calculus of variations.                 Its applications range from conservation laws of partial                        differential equations to Riemannian structures and variational                 problems in differential geometry.                                                   The variational bicomplex is a bicomplex of differential                   forms which derives its name from the fact that one of its                      differentials may be identified with the Euler-Lagrange operator                from the calculus of variations. Anderson's work will focus                     principally on the calculation of the cohomology of the                         variational bicomplex. When applied to systems of differential                  equations the importance of this cohomology arises from the fact                that it is generated, in part, by the conservation laws of the                  equations. In this context Anderson will investigate the case of                over-determined systems of equations. Group actions on a fiber                  bundle also give rise to the problem of calculating equivariant                 cohomology.

Simon's research will                    proceed in three broad directions. The first of these involves                  problems relating to the singular set of minimal surfaces. The                  second concerns entire and exterior solutions of the minimal                    surface equation for the graph of a function.

The basic questions regarding singular sets of minimal                     surfaces are concerned with the behaviour of such surfaces on                   approach to a singular point. Simon has already obtained strong                 results in the case where the singularity is isolated and will                  now investigate more general situations. The investigations of                  the minimal surface equation will center around the asymptotic                  behaviour of entire and exterior solutions. Here the emphasis                   will be on investigations in a high dimensional setting. The                    Willmore functional is a certain average of the mean curvature.                 The questions here relate to minimizing this functional over                    surfaces of a certain genus.                                                          White will investigate the dimension of the singular set of               area minimizing integral currents. This may lead to the discovery               of such sets of fractional dimension. A related problem is to                   find conditions under which almost every boundary gives rise to                 regular area minimizing disks. He will also investigate the                     existence of compact minimal submanifolds in Riemannian                         manifolds.

He also                    wants to proceed with his analysis of rigidity phenomena of                     metric foliations, i.e. locally everywhere equidistant                          partitions, in nonnegatively curved manifolds, which has turned                 out to be a crucial and delicate aspect of the global geometry of               such spaces.  In the area of submanifold theory he will work on                 various extensions  of recent global results concerning isometric               deformation of euclidean submanifolds, as well as explore the new               theory of minimal real Kaehler submanifolds, a special but ample                class of particularly interesting minimal submanifolds that                     surfaced in that context.  Ebin plans to work in three areas all                of which involve free boundary value problems.  The first is the                study of the motion of a thin membrane.  The second is the study                of dynamics of a liquid drop, and the third is the liquid drop                  model for a large nucleus.  The second and third areas are both                 studied as examples of dynamical systems constrained to                         submanifolds of function spaces.  A key step in this analysis is                the study of their relative curvature.

Its origins lie in the theoretical formulation for                   classical statistical mechanics at the end of the nineteenth                    century.  The modern point of view derives from the profound                    mathematical theory of recurrence and ergodicity, as developed by               Poincare, Birkhoff, von Neumann and other giants earlier in this                century.  As the subject has evolved and sophistication                         continually increased, ergodic theory has acquired close                        relationships with other branches of mathematics, such as                       dynamical systems, probability theory, functional analysis,                     number theory, differential topology, and differential geometry,                and with applications as far ranging as mathematical physics,                   information theory, and computer design.   The principal objects                of study in ergodic theory are transformations of an underlying                 set or space.  If for example, the transformation results from a                differential equation, is time dependent, or more generally                     evolves according to a more extensive process than time, one                    speaks of a flow on the underlying geometry.  This is the context               of the modern theory of dynamical systems, in which a                           fundamentalcritical question is the classification of flows on                  homogenous spaces.                                                                      Professor Ratner is one of the world leaders in the study of            certain geometric flows and their dynamics.  Her work on                        ""rigidity"" -- the classification of flows in terms of minimal                   data -- of horocycle flows is one of the top recent achievements                in ergodic theory and dynamical systems.  It comprises the most                 significant work to date in the classification of flows on                      homogeneous manifolds.  Her work has produced examples and                      counterexamples, and it has brought an important geometrical                    point of view to the subject.  In the current proposal she plans                to study more general, so-called unipotent, flows.  She hopes to                classify all Borel probability measures preserved by unipotent                  tranformations on finite volume homogeneous spaces; to                          investigate the rigidity properties of such transformations; and                to establish exponential mixing for ergodic flows on unit tangent               bundles of compact surfaces of variable negative curvature."

In the current project attention will be focussed on more general surfaces. Many of the important unresolved problems in this area depend on an understanding of the analytic properties of the Gauss map. In particular it is important to investigate which meromorphic functions on the unit disc arise as Gauss maps of complete minimal surfaces. One of the principal motivations for this work arises from Efimov's result that any complete surface in three dimensional space which has negative Gauss curvature must have points where this curvature is arbitrarily close to zero. This in turn is related to the conjecture of Caratheodory that every compact surface in three dimensional space which has positive Gauss curvature must have at least two umbilic points. Smyth and Xavier have already made substantial progress towards this conjecture and will continue their efforts in this direction. Other problems which will be investigated include the question as to whether there are bounded non-compact complete surfaces with negative Gauss curvature."

Its origins lie in the study of mathematical physics and partial differential equations in the early twentieth century. Thus, it was seen that numerous physical problems in the theory of equilibria, vibration, quantum theory, etc. could be studied productively via the integral equations that model the phenomena. So it has been, that from the fertile minds of Hilbert, von Neumann, and other giants that the subject of operator theory has grown to a central position in such investigations, and in core mathematics as well. Also central to Modern Analysis is the related discipline of operator algebras in which one studies collections of operators simultaneously. As the mathematical construct which best transfers the concepts of probability, measure theory, topology, and more recently geometry to noncommutative contexts, operator algebras relate to a rich, effective, and important array of applications. Professors Bunce, Paschke, Salinas, and Upmeier are all leaders in the areas of operator theory and operator algebras, and their research group at Kansas is one of the strongest and most versatile at any university in the United States. Collectively, this group covers a broad span of these disciplines. Professor Bunce has been a major contributor to the C*-algebra version of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, to abstract operator theory proper, and to applications in systems theory. Professor Salinas has made important contributions to C*-algebraic K-theory applied to single operator theory and several complex variables. Professor Paschke has made fundamental contributions to the study of concrete C*-algebras in the context of noncommutative algebraic topology. Professor Upmeier has a deep and penetrating understanding of bounded symmetric domains. He has been a major figure in the study of Toeplitz and Hankel operators on these domains. In the current proposal, Bunce will study dilation problems in operator theory, Bishop's theorem, and operator means and inequalities. Paschke will work on C*-algebras associated with discrete groups and will pursue problems dealing with irrational rotation C*-algebras. Salinas will continue his research on the joint behavior of n-tuples of operaors, gaining insight into the interplay between the spectral and C*-algebraic properties of the canonical n-tuple for classes of kernel functions. Upmeier will investigate a symbol calculus and index theory for multivariable Toeplitz operaors on pseudoconvex domains in complex n-space. He will also study non-type I Toeplitz C*-algebras related to automorphic functions and quantum mechanics. There are three postdoctoral mathematicians working with this group in a mentorial relationship. Their interests spread across Lie group C*-algebras, symplectic geometry, singular foliations, holomorphic curves in the Grassmanian, and noncommutative integration."
