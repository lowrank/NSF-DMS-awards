This duality has been successfully investigated for a long time, especially in the setting of closed systems, but many of its important manifestations are poorly understood, especially in the settings of open and mixed systems which are the principal investigator's focus. In open systems the method of complex scaling studied by the principal investigator appears in numerical analysis as the method of perfectly matched layers, where it has been useful in the engineering of nanostructures and microelectromechanical systems. Mixed systems like the ones studied by the principal investigator are important in electromagnetics, communications, optics, quantum waveguides, and semiconductors.<br/><br/>The main dynamical object studied by the principal investigator is the trapped set; this is the set of particle trajectories which remain in a bounded set for all time. The geometry of this set is of central importance in determining salient features of wave evolution, such as regularity, decay, and asymptotics. The principal investigator will study these features in the important but still comparatively mysterious situations of heavy trapping, rough coefficients, and noncompact trapped sets."

Manifolds and their geometric properties are not only central to various branches of mathematics but also are ubiquitous as mathematical models in the sciences. Perhaps the greatest example of this is in general relativity, where one of Einstein's great breakthroughs was the discovery that gravity is modeled by the mathematical notion of curvature. This research project focuses on curvature of Riemannian manifolds.  Specific emphasis will be placed on manifolds with density, which can be envisioned as Riemannian manifolds composed of a material with variable, as opposed to uniform, density.  Despite the appearance of manifolds with density in various areas of mathematics and applications, including proof of the Poincare conjecture, they are not yet well understood. This project addresses this gap by helping to develop a geometric theory of manifolds with density.  The project also uses geometry as a theme for a coherent program of educational activities that include: (1) professional development workshops in teaching and learning for in-service secondary education teachers, which will help support teachers in transition to recently developed K-12 standards; (2) innovation in introductory differential geometry curricula at the undergraduate and graduate level that, by emphasizing applications, will also foster new interaction between mathematics and science researchers; and (3) training of mathematics graduate students in best strategies for engaging students in introductory calculus courses.<br/> <br/>Ricci curvature for manifolds with density has been an active area of recent research.  This includes Ricci solitons, which are both fixed points of the Ricci flow and examples of spaces with constant weighted Ricci curvature, and the study of weighted Ricci curvature bounds. The investigator will continue study of the classification of shrinking Ricci solitons in dimension four and higher.  In addition to playing a key role in development of monotonic functionals for the Ricci flow, weighted Ricci curvature bounds also appear in the theory of optimal transport, isoperimetric inequalities, and general relativity and cosmology.   Despite the vast amount of research in Ricci curvature of manifolds with density, there was no corresponding theory of weighted sectional curvature until recently; another goal of this project is to further develop the theory of weighted sectional curvature bounds, including investigating applications and connections to other areas of mathematics.  Recent collaborative work of the investigator also introduces a new geometric approach to manifolds with density that places a certain torsion free affine connection as the fundamental object of study.   This approach not only provides new insight into the weighted Ricci and sectional curvatures but also suggests new natural structures that promise novel results, such as a weighted holonomy group, which will be investigated."

The overarching goal is to develop and relate the analysis and topology of singular geometric objects.

Often one can recast the questions in a manner adapted to the manifold with corners and subsequently apply a toolbox of strong techniques known as ""geometric microlocal analysis."" One aspect of this project is to contribute to the development and application of these techniques to a large class of singular spaces (stratified spaces), allowing analytic tools to be brought to bear on algebraic and topological questions. Another aspect of the project is to promote the entry of new investigators into this active area of research. The investigator will further develop a research monograph on the subject and organize courses and conferences to disseminate these techniques and results.<br/> <br/>An important example of a question at the confluence of geometric analysis, topology, and mathematical physics is to understand the signature of stratified spaces, such as those arising as the zeros of polynomials in several variables.

In this project explicit formulae will be established for the signature and its twisted analogues. The project also aims to develop a topological surgery theory for singular spaces and show that the signature operator naturally defines maps from this sequence. Other projects involve understanding an invariant of representations of the fundamental group of a locally symmetric space by changing the usual algebraic perspective to a geometric one."

The subject also has deep links with many areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations, representation theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry and topology. However, most research in gauge theory and almost all applications so far have focused on dimensions two, three and four.   In this project, the PI intends to push the boundary of our understanding of gauge theory in higher dimensions.  The PI's results are expected to have wide implications for geometric analysis, because the fundamental system of equations that define gauge theory (the Yang-Mills equations) poses additional challenges, in terms of controlling the solutions, that are not present in lower dimensions.  The PI's work will also have impact through integrated research and training, as the PI plans to involve undergraduates in research opportunities related to his project.<br/><br/>The PI's research project consists of three parts.  The first part of the project will extend this dictionary between gauge theory and complex algebraic geometry to the context of Hermitian-Yang Mills connections with singularities, and specifically understand the fine structure at the singularities in terms of the complex algebraic geometry of the corresponding reflexive sheaves. In the second part of this project, the PI will develop a deformation theory for a certain class of Yang-Mills connections called G2-instantons with one-dimensional singular set, and use this to construct concrete examples of singular G2-instantons from algebro-geometric input. The third part of the PI's research project will further explore the role that generalized Seiberg-Witten equations (specifically the ones discovered in joint work of Andriy Haydys and the PI) play in gauge theory in higher dimensions.  As alluded to above, the main obstacle to progress in gauge theory in higher dimension is our lack of understanding of the non-compactness issues arising from the fact that the Yang-Mills equations become super-critical starting in dimension five and leading to the formation of non-removable singularities and bubbling phenomena.  <br/>"

In joint work with his collaborators, he has recently developed a new geometric technique of ""abelianization"" -- so called because it reduces nonabelian problems (involving operations for which the order in which we do the operations matters) to simpler abelian ones (where the order does not matter). The PI, together with his collaborators and graduate students, will work on several new applications of abelianization. One application is a new approach to solving certain differential equations, including the Schrodinger equation which governs the physics of some quantum systems. A second application is a new way of measuring the topology of 3-dimensional spaces. The results of this work will be disseminated broadly both in the mathematics and high-energy physics communities, helping to bring these two areas closer together. The work will also contribute to the training of graduate students in both fields.<br/><br/>The PI's recent joint work with collaborators introduced a new ingredient to the theory of flat connections: a way of ""abelianizing"" flat connections on a rank N complex vector bundle over a surface, replacing them by almost-flat connections on a line bundle over an N-fold branched covering surface. The full scope of this new theory is not yet known: it appears that there are many more uses of abelianization yet to be discovered. The PI aims to develop some of these.  First, he will study a family of special connections on surfaces called ""opers,"" which can be abelianized in a canonical way.  On the one hand, this is a warmup for the abelianization of the twistor lines in the Hitchin system. On the other hand, it gives a new way of understanding the locus of opers and thus a new perspective on many related issues, from the classical theory of linear scalar differential operators to nonperturbative extensions of topological string theory. Second, he will consider abelianization on a 3-manifold instead of a surface. One immediate application is the development of new formulas for classical complex Chern-Simons invariants. Third, the PI aims to develop a new relation between abelianization and Floer theory on cotangent bundles."

But the corresponding question is completely open for 4-dimensional spaces.  Moreover, this dimension stands out among others, since certain 4-dimensional spaces can support infinitely many different smooth structures, which may admit geometries with radically different properties. These facts make 4-dimensional geometry in many ways unpredictable, and a fertile field for interdisciplinary research, as the subject has grown in many directions and branched into other areas of mathematics and physics.  This research project is based on interactions between fields including geometry, topology, and analysis.  The investigator will undertake an in-depth analysis of a class of unbounded 4-dimensional spaces that are important from the perspective of general relativity, that carry a geometry modeled on the complex numbers, and whose geometry is mildly uniform. In another direction, the investigator will examine closed 4-dimensional spaces whose curvature is similarly uniform. <br/> <br/>In more detail, the investigator will undertake a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotically locally Euclidean Kähler manifolds. This is a special class of non-compact 4-dimensional manifolds that generalizes the gravitational instantons from theoretical physics. The project has far-reaching applications in understanding the global structure of closed constant scalar curvature Kähler or almost-Kähler manifolds. A second group of projects focuses on the study of the Riemannian properties of 4-manifolds in conjunction with techniques coming from Seiberg-Witten theory. In particular, the investigator will analyze the moduli space of Einstein metrics or constant scalar curvature metrics and their compactifications in Gromov-Hausdorff topology. The techniques employed come from gauge theory, global analysis, algebraic geometry, and differential topology."

In this way, it provides a great platform to promote research and advance knowledge in the fields of geometry and topology. The Lehigh-Harvard conference also makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from the region and around the country to learn the most recent developments, to meet with each other and to share mathematics. Through the participation of the conference, graduate students, post-doctoral scholars and members of under-represented groups are exposed to exciting research in geometry and topology and have the chance to interact with experts in the fields. When the conference is held at Lehigh, in addition to invited talks, considerable time is set aside for 40-minute contributed talks (in parallel sessions) by the participants, and a large percentage of such talks in the past have been presented by graduate students, postdocs and women mathematicians. The invited speakers and other senior researchers also attend these contributed talks, and they provide excellent feedback to the speakers, especially for junior faculty and graduate students. In this way, the Lehigh conference provides an excellent opportunity for graduate students and recent PhDs to present their own research.<br/><br/>The 2017 Conference on Geometry and Topology will take place at Harvard University from April 28 to May 2, 2017. It will feature a total of 33 invited talks by leading experts in many diverse areas of geometry, topology, and related fields: differential and symplectic geometry, algebraic and complex geometry, geometric analysis and geometric flows, geometric topology, mathematical physics, theoretical physics, etc. The conference will highlight some of the most exciting progress in geometry and topology in recent years. The scope and the large number of distinguished speakers makes this conference unique. Participation is open, and there is no registration fee. Graduate students, recent PhDs, and members from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.

Moreover, the project addresses the effect of regularity on the algebraic structure of finitely generated subgroups of homeomorphism groups on compact manifolds, and will construct groups which can act with prescribed levels of regularity but which are not smoothable to higher levels of regularity.

To realize these goals, junior researchers (including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) and researchers from various under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply and will be given priority for financial support from the organizing committee.<br/><br/>The workshop will bring leading experts from all over the world to present the new results and/or surveys of current progresses in geometric analysis, in particular, from the following subfields: (1) Analysis of geometric PDE including curvature flows (e.g., power of Gauss curvature flow, Ricci flow, gradient Ricci solitons, and manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bound); (2) Kahler-Einstein metrics and the Kahler-Ricci flow (e.g., singular Kahler metrics, the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Kahler manifolds, the regularity and weak solutions of Kahler-Ricci flow, and Kahler-Ricci solitons); (3) Minimal submanifolds and mean curvature flow (e.g., special Lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry, min-max theory from the proof of Willmore conjecture, and the formation of singularities of mean curvature flow); and (4) Mathematical general relativity (e.g., space-like hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature, the center of mass, and the nonlinear gluing approach). Since 2010 PIMS Workshop on Geometric Analysis, there are many exciting new results and new techniques in these fields, and the conference will have about 25 speakers discussing these advances. The abstract of talks and videos from the workshop will be posted on the conference webpage http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/170724-ccga"

The Poisson Geometry Conference series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers alike. The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians inspired by problems arising in physics, and physicists searching for new mathematical tools.  The meetings  also serve as a unique forum for junior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson geometry and to disseminate their own research results in the field. <br/><br/>Poisson geometry originated as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history began with classical work by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the work of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The ""Gone Fishing"" workshops provide an excellent opportunity for members of various groups working on related areas from different perspectives to exchange new ideas and stimulate collaboration.  The goal of each workshop is to address important questions and future directions of the subject. <br/><br/>Conference website: http://www3.nd.edu/~conf/pgc2017/"

If we think of the surface as a drumhead which vibrates freely at certain frequencies, then, roughly speaking, the more complicated a geometry we have the smaller will be its fundamental frequencies.  This suggests the problem of looking for geometries which maximize the fundamental frequency for their area. This extremal question is a difficult and much studied problem. It turns out that the geometries which arise are related to surfaces of least area (soap films). The principal investigator will investigate such extremal configurations for surfaces with boundary. The other main area of investigation concerns the Einstein equations of general relativity. These equations describe the gravitational field for massive bodies in the universe. The theory is purely geometric and is a wave theory with an initial value formulation. The proposer is planning to investigate the geometry of solutions to give conditions under which gravitational collapse takes place and black holes are formed. Such questions lead to important geometric questions involving gravitational energy and curvature of spacetime.  The proposed research is at the interface between differential geometry, general relativity, and partial differential equations.<br/><br/>A main theme of the research in geometry will be the study of spectral geometry.  One project aims to construct metrics on surfaces and certain higher dimensional manifolds subject to an area or boundary length constraint which maximize the first eigenvalue. This is a nonstandard type of variational problem since it involves maximizing and minimizing over infinite dimensional spaces of competitors.  The principal investigator will study the geometry of such maximizing metrics to determine the optimal shapes with largest fundamental frequency. Work in relativity will continue investigations into the construction proposed by Bartnik of mass minimizing extensions of compact domains and static vacuum metrics.  The principal investigator also intends to study geometric properties of initial data sets to address the question of whether they can contain non-compact stable trapped surfaces. The principal investigator intends to investigate global properties of the moduli space of solutions of the constraint equations which define the possible initial data for the Einstein equations. A range of questions will be pursued concerning minimal submanifolds satisfying free boundary conditions and connections to eigenvalue problems. In a continuing study of minimal Lagrangian and special Lagrangian submanifolds of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds the principal investigator will attempt to prove a conjecture concerning the invariance of the subgroup of the integral homology of a Calabi-Yau manifold which is generated by minimal Lagrangian cycles when one deforms the ambient Calabi-Yau structure."

A ""geometric structure"" means a set of coordinate systems where the coordinates live in a space with a ""classical geometry:"" examples include Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, projective geometry, affine geometry or conformal geometry. Since the mid 19th century, considerations of symmetry emphasize the viewpoint that a classical geometry is just the study of properties which are unchanged under the transitive action of a Lie group.  Closely related is the importance of symmetry in modern physics, and many of objects in this investigation have physical motivations. Classification of geometric structures on a fixed topology means putting the more rigid geometric measurements on a loosely organized collection of points, which is the topology.  A simple example is the fact that the sphere cannot support  Euclidean geometry.  This is just the mathematical abstraction of the fact that there is no metrically accurate world atlas. At least one page of the world atlas will distort distance.   On the other hand the torus (the surface of a doughnut, bagel or inner tube) does admit Euclidean structures. In fact the different ways of putting Euclidean geometry on a torus has a rich geometry of its own. Technology plays a key tool both in this investigation and its dissemination to the public. Many mathematicians are involved in this project, including colleagues, postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students and even high school students. The objects of study are often two- and three-dimensional and can be visualized with the use of computers. All the software developed in the project is publicly available and invites further education and experimentation in this research project.<br/><br/><br/>While the traditional methods of classification of geometric  structures involve a quotient space, frequently the moduli spaces are pathological. Simple examples lead to quotients of nice spaces by chaotic group actions. The PI adopts the viewpoint that classification of geometric structures is really a  dynamical system. Many well known interesting dynamical systems arise from this context. In particular the extension of the Teichmuller geodesic flow  to the universal character variety over the  Riemann moduli space has rich dynamics, impacting low-dimensional geometry, topology and mathematical physics.  The PI will study this dynamical system as the fusion of  the well-developed subject of Teichmuller dynamics and his previous work on mapping class group dynamics on character varieties and  moduli spaces of geometric structures."

The project also aims to bring in research and teaching innovation in mathematics from various disciplines and have an immediate beneficial effect on undergraduate and graduate students at Rutgers as well as in the regional mathematical community. The principal investigator will continue to organize and participate in the integrated research/education programs and activities that will promote the education level of the nation. Furthermore, the principal investigator plans to disseminate the exciting frontier research at the interface of analysis and geometry to a broad audience through lectures and survey papers.<br/><br/>These projects will investigate canonical metrics of Einstein type on Kahler varieties with mild singularities. In particular, the principal investigator will study the Riemannian geometric properties of such singular metrics and analytic moduli problems for Kahler-Einstein manifolds. The PI will continue to make progress in the analytic minimal model program with Ricci flow by studying both the finite time and long time formation of singularities of the Kahler-Ricci flow on algebraic varieties. Such singularity formation is reflected by canonical geometric surgeries equivalent to birational transformations and should be understood through global and local metric uniformization. The PI willy employ new theories and techniques from L^2-theory, nonlinear PDEs and Cheeger-Colding theory.

Despite its classical origins, this research area has recently experienced an explosion of progress centered on the study of quantum invariants defined using geometric objects known as holomorphic curves.  These quantum invariants have appeared not only in geometric analysis but also in low-dimensional topology, which studies three-dimensional space as well as four-dimensional space-time, and in certain models in high-energy physics.  The investigator will study fundamental questions about these quantum invariants, including their behavior under mathematical operations known as surgery and symmetry reduction.   Applications will be of interest in topology and physics. The investigator will also continue his outreach activities for middle-school geometry teachers.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project studies the behavior of quantum invariants such as the Fukaya category and quantum K-theory under operations such as flips, blow-ups, and symplectic reduction.  In the first part of the project, the investigator will construct generators of the Fukaya category associated to surgeries on the symplectic manifold that arise naturally as the symplectic structure is varied.   Each of these gives rise to a collection of objects in the Fukaya category, and conjecturally a factor in the quantum cohomology.  The main technique here involves the Abouzaid-Ganatra generation criterion and a restricted version of symplectic field theory for the Fukaya category developed using stabilizing divisors.  In the second part of the project, the investigator and collaborators will construct a homotopy version of Kirwan's map from the quasimap Fukaya category of a Hamiltonian group action to the Fukaya category of the symplectic quotient.  This study will have applications to the disk potentials of Lagrangians in symplectic quotients.   In a third collaborative project, the investigator will study the behavior of K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants under wall-crossing and aims to prove that the potentials are unchanged, generically, in the case of crepant birational transformations associated to variation of symplectic quotient."

In classical mechanics, the state of a physical system at any given time is described by n position coordinates and n momentum coordinates. These 2n coordinates specify a point in a 2n-dimensional phase space. The phase space has the structure of a symplectic manifold, and understanding the geometry of this symplectic manifold is crucial to understanding how the physical system evolves in time.  This project will investigate closely related notions of ""space"" and ""time"" in symplectic geometry. The ""space"" notion to be studied is that of a symplectic embedding: this is a change of coordinates which preserves the symplectic structure but may make the equations of motion easier to solve. The ""time"" notion to be investigated is that of a Reeb orbit: this describes behavior which repeats in time, such as a planet orbiting around a star.<br/><br/>In order to study symplectic embeddings and Reeb orbits, new technology in various forms of contact homology will be developed. In particular, foundational work will be carried out on cylindrical contact homology and its more generally defined counterpart, positive circle-equivariant symplectic homology. This will lead to new symplectic embedding obstructions. Also, new infrastructure in embedded contact homology (ECH) will be constructed. In particular, a filtration on ECH determined by a transverse knot in a contact three-manifold will be studied, with applications to the dynamics of area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms. The ""J-zero"" index on ECH will be further studied with applications to proving the existence of infinitely many Reeb orbits in more cases.  With the help of this machinery, a circle of questions surrounding Viterbo's conjecture, on the uniqueness of normalized symplectic capacities for convex sets, will be investigated. Known symplectic capacities will be compared, and the symplectic significance of convexity will be elaborated. New algorithms for computing symplectic capacities will be developed, in order to enable computer-assisted searches for counterexamples to Viterbo's and related conjectures. Applications of other versions of contact homology to questions in quantitative symplectic geometry will also be explored. These other versions of contact homology include rational symplectic field theory, and possible analogues of ECH in higher dimensions."

This research project will broaden our understanding of a class of such ""shape space"" problems in which the geometric objects are surfaces (i.e. flat or curved two-dimensional shapes) or closely related spaces built from higher-dimensional pieces assembled in a two-dimensional pattern. These are natural examples to study because of the frequent appearance of surface geometry in a wide variety of mathematical problems and applications.  In addition to contributing to mathematical knowledge, the computational and visualization components of this project will produce striking images of mathematical objects that exhibit their intricate structure and complexity in a way that can be appreciated by scientists and non-scientists alike.<br/><br/>A locally homogeneous geometric structure on a compact manifold determines a holonomy representation, which is a homomorphism from the fundamental group of the manifold into a Lie group.  The resulting map from the space of geometric structures to the space of group representations is always a local homeomorphism, but apart from a few classical examples (such as constant curvature geometries), the global behavior of the holonomy correspondence is not well understood.  The investigator will contribute to our understanding of this basic problem by studying cases in which analytic methods can be brought to bear.  For example, families of Anosov representations of surface groups in complex Lie groups are amenable to study through Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory, and through the application of tools from complex-analytic Teichmueller theory.  In other cases, such as real projective structures on compact surfaces and generalizations thereof, geometric structures can be understood in terms of the solutions of a system of partial differential equations on the underlying manifold, allowing geometric questions to be attacked through techniques such as asymptotic analysis, barriers, and maximum principles."

Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness. Its importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by the French mathematician Poincare, during his investigation of the laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to Newton's laws.  In the past twenty years, topology has seen applications in questions such as the knotting of and proteins DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The topology of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher dimension, is of particular subtlety. Graph theory also has a long history. It is the mathematical theory of networks and their connections, and sees application in many aspects computer science, algorithms and optimization. By viewing networks as embedded in three-dimensional space, this project aims to use techniques from topology to study questions in graph theory. The topological techniques will be drawn from many sources, but particularly from gauge theory, a field having its origins in fundamental physics. The project will deepen our understanding of topology and its interaction with other areas of mathematics and science. At the same time, the project will train graduate students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.<br/><br/>The project activity will be in the following specific areas. In collaboration with T. S. Mrowka, the PI will develop properties of an instanton homology for spatial trivalent graphs. This instanton homology was constructed in previous work using a gauge theory related to representations of the fundamental group of the graph's complement in the group of rotations, SO(3). The PI will investigate the dimension of the SO(3) instanton homology for general planar trivalent graphs. It is expected that the dimension is always related to the number of three-edge-colorings of the graph. As a stepping stone towards the proof, an variant of the instanton homlogy will be constructed using the larger group SU(3), and fixed-point theory will be used to compare the two versions. If the previous two goals are achieved, it will follow from this and other work that every bridgeless, planar trivalent graph admits at least one three-edge-coloring, a major result in the field, as it is equivalent to the four-color theorem, which is the statement that the regions of any planar map can be colored using only four colors. The four-color theorem has been proved previously only with computer assistance, and it is hoped that this project might therefore lead the way to the first human-readable proof."

D. students and junior researchers from different countries. Its objectives are to present and discuss the latest results on the geometric aspects and dynamics of resonances, share points of view and ideas, and to strengthen or promote interactions.  The conference will give Ph.D. students and young scientists the opportunity to meet some of the prominent researchers in the fields related to resonances and to exchange ideas with them. To make the more specialized talks accessible to the participants, some experts will give tutorial and survey talks. Moreover, two afternoons will be devoted to talks of junior participants. This will give the Ph.D. students and the postdocs the possibility of presenting their work, which is an essential step for entering in the world of research and for building scientific collaborations. <br/><br/>The notion of resonance was introduced in quantum mechanics to study metastable states of a system, that is long-lived states from which the system deviates only with sufficiently strong disturbances. Mathematically, resonances appear either as discrete eigenvalues of the quantization of a classical Hamiltonian or as the eigenvalues of the transfer operator of the classical flow. Their study, initially aimed at Schroedinger operators on R^n, was extended to more geometric situations. Because of the role they play in various physical contexts there has been a considerable progress in understanding the geometry and the analysis of classical and quantum resonances in the last years. Nevertheless, many important and basic questions are still open. Many difficulties preventing to use classical arguments arise because of the non-self-adjoint nature of resonances. Also, in the geometric case of (locally) symmetric spaces, very little is known when the rank of the spaces is bigger than 1. Partial advances have been obtained, with several different approaches, using either harmonic analysis and representation theory, or microlocal analysis and techniques from scattering theory such as complex scaling. To study resonances in higher dimensional and higher rank geometric situations, a joint effort of different mathematical communities is therefore needed, and young researchers should have contacts with experts from the various aspects of the theory to make significant progress.

Now group theorists are interested not just in decidability of various problems but in specific low-complexity estimates. Various data compression techniques (such as straight-line programs, power circuits, etc.) have found amazing applications to group-theoretic decision problems. In turn, geometric group theory has repaid in kind and produced powerful ideas that have found applications in computer science and computability theory. Thus, the notion of ""generic-case complexity"" as a way of capturing the practical behavior of an algorithm on ""most"" inputs (and distinct from average-case complexity) was born in geometric group theory. This notion has led to the development of the theory of coarse and generic computability in computational complexity, which is now transforming that subject. The ideas of CAT(0) cubical geometry, coming from geometric group theory, are finding useful applications in computational topology, robotics, and computer science. The conference aims to take stock of these developments and map possible future venues of interaction between geometric group theory, computer science and computability theory. <br/><br/>More detailed information can be found at the conference website, http://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Schupp/"

An expected educational impact is the fostering of new opportunities for research training for undergraduates.  In this area the PI plans to continue his efforts, which have led to two publications by undergraduates in peer-reviewed journals in the last several years.  The PI also plans to continue his commitment to reach broader segments of the public, for example through participation in prison education initiatives and through outreach to local high schools. In a different direction, the PI plans to continue conversations with researchers in other fields of science to find new collaborative opportunities. The PI will disseminate the results of the project as broadly as possible, for example through organizing conferences and through effective use of online tools. <br/><br/>To elaborate on the scientific merit of the project, previous work of the PI used a special kind of contact homology, called embedded contact homology (ECH), to show that any vector field of Reeb type on a closed three-manifold has at least two distinct periodic orbits.  In fact, evidence suggests that stronger results hold, and in the current project the PI and collaborators plan to show in many cases that a Reeb vector field with more than two closed orbits has infinitely many.  Insights into Reeb dynamics also come from the closely related field of symplectic embedding problems, and this project will pursue several lines of inquiry in this direction, for example one thread involves better understanding the number theoretic aspects of four-dimensional embedding problems while another involves finding new obstructions to symplectic embeddings in higher dimensions.  New combinatorial tools are expected to be useful for these investigations, so the PI plans to continue developing an irrational version of the classical Ehrhart theory familiar from the theory of lattice point enumeration.  More speculative directions of the project involve establishing new formulas for the asymptotics of the ECH spectrum and further developing the foundations of embedded contact homology by applying new tools for regularizing moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves."

Their classification is the far-reaching problem in this field, and this project aims to answer a few central questions in this framework. After the ground-breaking work of B. Riemann in dimension one, the theory of higher dimensional algebraic and analytic varieties developed impressively fast under the impetus of differential geometry and global analysis methods. The concept of positivity, with its twofold incarnations - in algebraic terms (positivity of divisors and algebraic cycles), or in analytic terms (plurisubharmonicity, positive curvature) - played a key role in such development.  These investigations will pursue further this circle of ideas by treating problems arising from algebraic geometry via analytic techniques. The main motivation is to show that the methods developed in analysis can offer a very powerful complement to the purely algebraic methods. A successful implementation of this project would lead to important progress towards classification problems in both algebraic and analytic geometry.<br/><br/>These projects are structured in three main parts. The first concerns generalizations of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi theorem on analytic extensions, with connections to questions arising in the minimal model program of algebraic geometry.  The second line of investigation concerns regularity properties of degenerate Monge-Ampere equations and planned applications to certain relative canonical bundles.  Given an algebraic fiber space, one of the main objects of study is its corresponding relative canonical bundle. In many instances, this bundle carries some positivity, and the project is to use the Monge-Ampere theory in order to quantify the amount of positivity this bundle has.  The third research direction is an analysis of the positivity properties of the canonical bundle of rank one holomorphic foliations defined on the jet spaces corresponding to a projective variety.  This is in connection to the notion of Kobayashi hyperbolicity, where such foliations appear naturally."

Over the last few decades, M-theory, a ""theory of everything"",  has emerged as a candidate for such a unification of these forces.  This project is about manifolds with special holonomy, spaces whose infinitesimal symmetries allow them to play a crucial role in M-theory 'compactifications'---that is, they model the tiny 'curled up' dimensions lurking at every point of spacetime.   In this project, the principal investigator will focus in particular on 6-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds (which play the analogous role of the curled-up dimensions of superstring theory) and spaces of dimension 7 and 8 whose symmetries fill out the special holonomy groups known as G2 and Spin(7), respectively.  Despite extensive research on Calabi-Yau manifolds, the geometric properties of G2 and Spin(7) manifolds are not well understood, and the problem of the existence of calibrated (i.e., volume minimizing) submanifolds is still wide open.  One goal of this project is to develop techniques that are robust enough to handle these difficult existence questions. Another goal is to study the deformation spaces of calibrated submanifolds, as understanding these spaces will ultimately be useful for M-theory compactifications.  The PI also believes that manifolds with special holonomy is an excellent topic for graduate research, and intends to continue to supervise PhD students.  She plans to encourage women and members of other under-represented groups to take up graduate study and continue to research careers in differential geometry, through activities that include advising, organizing seminars, special sessions, conference and ""Women in Math"" workshops.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI plans to continue her work on Ricci-flat manifolds, their calibrated geometries and the compactifications of moduli spaces. In recent joint work with F. Arikan and H. Cho, she showed that every G2 manifold is an almost contact manifold. Studying the relations between contact and G2 structures can be useful to find the existence conditions of a G2 metric  on 7-manifolds (similar to the existence conditions of the Calabi-Yau metric). In another joint work with Cho and A.J. Todd, she investigated the properties of G2 manifolds from a symplectic point of view. Using contact and symplectic structures, the PI plans to construct Lagrangian and Legendrian type submanifolds  of G2 and Spin(7) manifolds. Also, in joint work with C. Robles, she applied the Cartan-Kahler theory to associative and Cayley embeddings into G2 and Spin(7) manifolds, and she plans to use these techniques to construct new examples of G2 and Spin(7) manifolds and study their contact and symplectic structures. In other joint work with D. Joyce, the PI studied deformations of asymptotically cylindrical coassociative submanifolds and their topological quantum field theories, and with Todd she also proved similar results for asymptotically cylindrical special Lagrangian submanifolds. The PI plans to apply these techniques on special Lagrangian moduli spaces inside Calabi-Yau manifolds to obtain a framework for the Floer homology program. Understanding the moduli spaces of these submanifolds will provide a better understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomenon."

Surprising connections between these two very different areas of research have been observed in recent years: the principal investigator has been involved in the study of these relationships between high-energy physics and number theory, and she is currently developing new mathematical approaches towards a better understanding of this mysterious connection.  The goal of this project is to extend this connection beyond its original occurrence in quantum field theory to other areas, including statistical physics, string theory, and quantum information. <br/><br/>This project comprises several related investigations. The Feynman diagram calculations used in high-energy physics to describe events in particle physics experiments have a rich and not yet fully understood mathematical structure, involving motives and periods of algebraic varieties, which are objects of study in algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and number theory.  This project aims to develop new techniques to improve understanding of these arithmetic structures in quantum field theory. Similar mathematical structures based on periods and motives of algebraic varieties occur in models of modified gravity developed for applications to cosmology; this new, unexpected development will be investigated in depth as part of the research. The project will also study a framework for a discretization of the ""holographic correspondence"" of string theory, between gravity on a bulk space and conformal field theory on the boundary, built in number-theoretic terms using p-adic numbers. The project aims to develop this p-adic form of the AdS/CFT correspondence into a larger theoretical framework, with a view to explaining in arithmetic terms the emergence of spacetime geometry from information. The work will also continue development of another novel approach to the relation between geometry and information, a construction of anyon models of topological quantum computation based on special solutions (gravitational instantons) of the Einstein equations, with singularities along two-dimensional surfaces. The investigator is also pursuing new number theoretic approaches to quantum statistical mechanics, where the properties of the quantum systems correspond to properties of certain classes of zeta functions studied in analytic number theory, and the equilibrium states of the systems capture Galois symmetries. Finally, the investigator is developing a new approach to distributed computing in theoretical computer science, based on the technique of dynamical triangulations developed in physics as a model of quantum gravity."

It centers around questions about the structures and symmetries of a symplectic manifold--an even-dimensional space that locally looks like the phase space containing the position and momentum of a moving particle.  Modern physics has led to the discoveries of many important and sophisticated invariants of symplectic manifolds, and has predicted a number of deep connections to different fields of mathematics. Current definitions and approaches to these invariants are based on the analysis of a special kind of mapping of a surface to a symplectic manifold, known as the theory of holomorphic curves. The primary goal of the project is to develop an alternative approach to some of these invariants, which is more accessible and which will form the foundations of effective calculations. The approach is based on the microlocal sheaf theory, which was invented as an algebraic and topological method to study differential equations. The project will have many applications in the field of representation theory, a rich subject focusing on the study of symmetries appearing in mathematics and physics. The PI will also continue to organize seminars on related topics, disseminate her results through academic events, and provide research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will use microlocal sheaf theory to quantize Lagrangian submanifolds in an exact symplectic manifold, and will give the definition of a microlocal sheaf category of a symplectic manifold, which is expected to be equivalent to the important symplectic invariant, known as the Fukaya category.  The approach is purely topological, and it allows the coefficient ring to be a ring spectrum, which opens up interesting connections to stable homotopy theory. The PI will develop a parallel story in the complex setting of holomorphic Lagrangians in an exact holomorphic symplectic manifold, which exhibits new and richer structures and which will have important applications in geometric representation theory. The PI will use this to quantize holomorphic Lagrangians in symplectic resolutions, a class of holomorphic symplectic manifolds in the center of modern representation theory, with the goal of understanding the mysterious phenomena of symplectic duality. Other applications to representation theory involve calculations in the Hecke category using sheaf quantizations of the braid group action as symplectomorphisms and a proposal to realize the nonabelian Hodge theory using microlocal perverse sheaves."

There are many such equations, and the behavior of their solutions reflects the different kinds of phenomena we observe including the dispersion of heat, the effect of gravity, the motion of fluids and the movement of subatomic particles.  Moreover, mathematicians use PDEs to understand geometric spaces and the possible structures that can exist on them.  This project investigates the use of PDEs in two kinds of geometric problems.  The first concerns the Calabi-Yau equation:  this is a PDE used as a model in string theory and has wide-ranging applications in the study of geometric spaces defined by algebraic equations.  A goal of this project is to generalize and solve the Calabi-Yau equation on spaces with much less structure, with a long term aim of classifying all such spaces.  The second kind of geometric problem concerns a phenomenon known as collapsing.  This occurs in the study of geometric heat equations where a geometric space evolves in time and may collapse in some directions to yield a lower dimensional object.  This collapsing can reveal the structure of the original space.  In order to carry out these investigations, the PI will need to develop new technical tools.  The PI will take advantage of techniques which have been developed for classical equations such as the heat equation, and will adapt them to the study of non-linear PDEs occurring in geometry.<br/><br/>This project will investigate nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations, with applications to complex and almost geometry.  In particular, the PI will study the problem of prescribing volume forms on manifolds, extending the well-known theorem of Yau for compact Kahler manifolds.  Building on the PI's work on Hermitian and Gauduchon manifolds, the PI will investigate the question of prescribing volume forms for balanced metrics, and for almost Kahler metrics on four-manifolds.  Another major goal of this project is to understand the phenomenon of collapsing along geometric flows.  Collapsing for the Kahler-Ricci flow at infinite time is now quite well-understood.  The PI will focus on the difficult problem of finite time collapse.  This occurs for the Kahler-Ricci flow on Fano manifolds and also for the Chern-Ricci flow (a flow of Hermitian metrics) on non-Kahler complex manifolds such as the Hopf surface.  To accomplish these goals, the PI will develop new tools for the study of nonlinear PDE.  In particular, the PI will consider new second order estimates exploiting the convexity of the largest eigenvalue of Hessian.  These kinds of estimates have already been used successfully to establish constant rank theorems for a general class of PDEs and optimal regularity results for the degenerate complex Monge-Ampere equation. The PI will also develop multi-point maximum principles, which have a long history in the study of convexity properties of solutions to PDEs, in the context of complex geometry."

The natural domains of complex-number-valued functions are complex manifolds, including the n-dimensional complex Euclidean space. This project concerns the relationship between the geometry of a natural class of complex manifolds, called Kahler manifolds, and the behavior of complex functions on these manifolds.  One of the most beautiful results in complex analysis (the study of complex-valued functions) is the uniformization theorem, which says that one-dimensional complex manifolds have essentially only three shapes: a sphere, a disc, or a plane, corresponding to positive, negative, or zero curvature. A higher-dimensional version of uniformization has long eluded mathematicians; for example, it is conjectured that if an open n-dimensional complex manifold has positive curvature then it is a copy of complex n-space.  The PI will address this long-standing conjecture.  The resulting research, which lies at the intersection of many branches of mathematics, will establish new and interesting connections between analysis, algebra, differential geometry and topology.<br/><br/>More precisely, the PI will work on the uniformization conjecture of Yau, which states that a complete noncompact Kahler manifold with positive bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to complex n-space. So far there have been numerous attempts at this conjecture, starting with Mok-Siu-Yau in early 1980s.  Along with the uniformization conjecture, the PI will also address related problems such as Siu's conjecture on Stein-ness of complete noncompact Kahler manifolds with positive bisectional curvature.  As in the PI's earlier work, the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence theory will serve as an important tool to study these conjectures. The PI will also study the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Kahler manifolds with curvature lower bound (e.g., the degeneration of the complex structure). In some sense, this is a generalization of the breakthrough result of Donaldson-Sun on Kahler manifolds. The expectation is that the limit space should carry a natural complex analytic structure."

This research project is aimed at developing the theory of a particular class of symmetry transformations that act on differential equations, which are ubiquitous in models of natural systems.  The project aims to develop a new perspective on these Darboux transformations, combining a previously-developed algebraic approach with a geometric viewpoint.  This will be done, in particular, in the ""super"" setting; this refers to the mathematical apparatus relevant for supersymmetry, a theoretical notion introduced in connection with study of elementary particles.

Preliminary investigations show that this will require tackling new factorization problems for partial differential operators; the project will explore a differential invariants approach using regularized moving frames. One of the sub-goals is to analyze operators acting on forms on vector bundles.  The investigator also plans to construct and study a ""universal manifold"" of DTs defined by the intertwining relation and to establish a connection between DTs and a recent notion of ""higher symmetries"" of differential operators.

Mean curvature flow also arises in the physical world.  For example, grain boundaries in annealing metals move by mean curvature flow. The Principal Investigator will also investigate minimal surfaces.  Minimal surfaces are equilibrium shapes for mean curvature flow, that is, shapes that do not change over time.  In astronomy, minimal surfaces occur as  ""apparent horizons"" of black holes. Here on earth, soap films provide examples of minimal surfaces.

This geometric theory of gravity is fundamental to our understanding of the large-scale structure of the universe, and has many practical applications such as to the fine tuning of global positioning system (GPS) technology. The PI will seek to establish families of geometric inequalities relating mass, charge, angular momentum, and horizon area, which probe the grand weak cosmic censorship conjecture. This conjecture asserts that whenever singularities arise in spacetime (which is a generic phenomenon) they must always be shrouded inside a black hole event horizon; this is intimately tied to whether general relativity is a proper deterministic theory. Special black hole solutions with symmetry (referred to as stationary axisymmetric and electro-vacuum) play a large role in our understanding of the theory, and this project seeks to classify them in higher dimensions relevant to string theory. In particular, the PI aims to prove existence and uniqueness for such black holes with exotic (lens space) topologies in five spacetime dimensions. Furthermore, new criteria for gravitational collapse and black hole formation will be studied, namely those due to concentration of angular momentum and/or charge. The PI will also examine proposed definitions of quasi-local mass in order to determine whether they are mathematically and physically viable.<br/><br/>Based on earlier work with Bray, the PI has recently completed a systematic approach to treating the full family of Penrose-type inequalities by reducing each to a canonical system of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). Thus, the entire range of these geometric inequalities is within reach. A natural by-product, associated with the study of a certain subclass of these inequalities, concerns a general procedure for constructing singular harmonic maps having 2-dimensional hyperbolic space target, which naturally arise from the stationary axisymmetric vacuum Einstein equations in four dimensions. Together with G. Weinstein, who initiated the study of such harmonic maps with prescribed singularities, we have begun development of the tools necessary to substantially generalize the 4-dimensional results to allow for exotic topologies in higher dimensions as well as a wide range of symmetric space targets.  Moreover, in joint work with M. Anderson, the PI has established what may be considered as the first step of Bartnik's minimal mass extension conjecture, and our methods indicate what should be a successful approach to the remaining parts. The trapped surface/hoop conjecture, dealing with the conditions under which black holes may form, is highly sought after but not well understood. However, the PI's work on Penrose-type inequalities suggests new black hole formation criteria as well as certain isoperimetric-type inequalities for relativistic bodies."

This narrow focus serves to promote more meaningful contact in the context of mathematical research. The conference is intended to fuel young mathematicians' interest in research mathematics, promote inter- and intra-generational research ties, and demonstrate how undergraduates can be incorporated into research programs in these fields.<br/><br/>Three established speakers and three early-career speakers are invited by the organizing committee; these speakers are chosen both for their eminence in their respective fields and their ability to provide meaningful introductions to complex topics for audiences with a wide range of mathematical backgrounds. Invitations for submissions by graduate students and undergraduate students will be issued annually. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-specific committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6 graduate students and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make presentations, either as talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the conference provides opportunities for less formal interaction, including social events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our increased focus on incorporating undergraduates into professional life will include panel discussions from funded graduate students and early-career mathematicians covering important but seldom-discussed aspects of attending graduate school and pursuing an academic career in mathematics.<br/><br/>More information is available at the conference website:<br/>https://ux1.eiu.edu/~gdt/"

Its origins go back to the mathematical formulation of classical and quantum mechanics, where the notion of a Poisson bracket emerged. In more recent times, the study of spaces equipped with these brackets, called Poisson manifolds, developed into a branch of geometry, with important applications to other areas of mathematics, as well as other fields. For example, one can find Poisson brackets in the formulation of dynamics within field theory in high-energy physics, and in various models for population and evolutionary dynamics within biology. Understanding global properties of these spaces is a challenging problem due to the convergence of some unusual mathematical aspects: one finds a special type of geometry in certain directions, so that some directions in a Poisson manifold are distinguished from others; as well, some points in the space possess a rich set of local symmetries not present at other locations. This project aims to study global geometric and topological properties of Poisson manifolds, arguably the most central issue in modern day Poisson geometry. This project includes collaborations with various researchers in Poisson geometry working in Europe and South America, and aims to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists and groups with different points of view working on related areas, through a UIUC seminar and through a series of regional conferences in Poisson geometry.<br/><br/>In this project, global aspects of Poisson structures and related geometric structures are studied, primarily from the perspective of Lie groupoid theory and drawing on ideas and techniques from foliation theory, equivariant geometry, and from symplectic and integral affine geometry. These new ideas, together with results and techniques developed in the last decade, should lead to new methods to attack some long standing fundamental problems in Poisson geometry, such as the existence of regular Poisson structures, the classification of Poisson manifolds of compact type, and the existence of normal forms around symplectic leaves. The project also aims at breaking the current boundaries of Poisson geometry by advancing new interactions with other mathematical areas, such as exterior differential systems, integrable systems and the theory of geometric stacks."

Such construction problems arise not only in mathematics, but also in science, engineering, and medicine. Examples include identifying organs and tumors in the human body or designing the shapes of radar antennas or jet airplanes. The Brunn-Minkowski theory is at the heart of the mathematical and computational tools used in such applications. Central to the Brunn-Minkowski theory are isoperimetric inequalities, which express relationships between different types of geometric measurements (such as the surface area and volume) of a body, and Minkowski problems, which ask whether a shape can be reconstructed from a set of geometric measurements (such as the curvature of the boundary). The investigators will continue their work connecting ideas in information theory with Brunn-Minkowski theory. This work has generated interesting questions that are accessible to and can be explored by high school and undergraduate students. Graduate students also are involved in the research.<br/><br/>The overall theme of the research is to develop both extensions and duals of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory. In one project, the investigators aim to build upon prior results showing that, for each value of a real parameter p, there is an Lp Brunn-Minkowski theory. Just as the Minkowski problem for the surface area measure is a central focus of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory, the Minkowski problem for Lp surface area measure is central to the Lp Brunn-Minkowski theory. While most work been limited to when the parameter p is greater than 1, the investigators and collaborator are exploring the singular case, when p is 0, and aim to extend the work to non-positive p.  A second project concerns analogues of Federer's curvature measures within the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. Surprisingly, this newly discovered family includes two already known but important cases: the cone-volume measure and Aleksandrov's integral curvature measure. For each such dual curvature measure, there is a corresponding dual Minkowski problem, which is a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation. The investigators aim to further explore the dual Minkowski problem.  A third project further investigates Lp analogues of Aleksandrov's integral curvature; the investigators aim to solve completely the Minkowski problems associated with these measures. The investigators will continue their efforts to extend previous work on the parallels between information theory and both the Lp and dual Brunn-Minkowski theories. The investigators will also continue their work toward establishing the log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality, which to date has been established only in the plane."

As a closed surface evolves to decrease its area as rapidly as possible, convex points will move inwards, concave points move outwards, and the speed is slower where the surface is flatter. The area will decrease and eventually go to zero in finite time. In particular, any closed surface becomes extinct in finite time and, thus, singularities always occur.  This flow originated in the materials science literature and has been intensely studied in both pure and applied mathematics. The key to understanding the mean curvature flow is to understand the singularities it goes through.<br/><br/>These projects focus on a number of related aspects of the singularities: (1) Which singularities occur for a generic flow or a generic family of flows?  (2) What does the flow look like near a singularity? When is the blow up unique? (3) Is there a canonical neighborhoods theorem?  (4) What is the size and structure of the singular set? When is the singular set a nice submanifold? (5) Are singularities in Euclidean 3-space generically isolated? What about singular times?"

Physical predictions have led to the construction of new numerical invariants which provide novel insights into the geometry of different spaces. These invariants, which were initially difficult to rigorously define and calculate, can now be accessed using methods from algebraic geometry and also symplectic geometry (the study of spaces similar to phase spaces that arise in classical mechanics).  Motivated by conjectures and intuition from mathematical physics, the principal investigator (PI) plans to study new classes of enumerative invariants, their general structure, and relations between different enumerative theories.  This project, while developing new tools and methods in algebraic geometry, has at its roots conjectures originating in theoretical physics.  As such the project will help elucidate and verify physical conjectures, thus furthering understanding in this field. <br/> <br/>The goal of enumerative geometry broadly is to study a space by counting subspaces of a certain type. Gromov-Witten theory, for instance, defines invariants of a smooth complex algebraic variety X which give approximate counts of the number of complex curves in X. Another theory, Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten (FJRW) theory, is defined similarly, but gives invariants of a singularity rather than a smooth variety. Predictions by Witten and other physicists studying mirror symmetry indicate that these invariants have a rich structure and are often related to each other in surprising ways.  The recent introduction of the concept of so-called Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSMs), which simultaneously generalize Gromov-Witten theory, FJRW theory and many others, has the potential to transform the current understanding of enumerative geometry. While giving a unified framework for many different theories, defining enumerative invariants for GLSMs may provide new methods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants--a longstanding goal in both physics and mathematics--and will clarify certain mysterious correspondences between different theories such as the crepant transformation conjecture and the Landau-Ginzberg/Calabi-Yau correspondence.  The PI will give a general algebro-geometric construction of enumerative invariants associated to GLSMs, and use this new construction to realize those applications described above. The PI will also develop new computational techniques in Gromov-Witten theory, explore the recursive structure of these invariants (as predicted by the Witten-Kontsevich Theorem and the Virasoro Conjecture), and prove new correspondences related to mirror symmetry."

This award supports the participation of US-based researchers. The conference topics center on an area of geometry united by certain common ideas: the importance of moduli spaces, the relation between differential-geometric and algebro-geometric concepts, and semi-infinite-dimensional homology theories. The workshop aims to provide a venue for both junior and advanced researchers to broaden their outlook beyond their existing areas of expertise, by being exposed to promising new areas of activity. This award intends to offer this opportunity to a diverse group of US-based participants.<br/><br/>The aim of the meeting is to reconnect these research strands and spur interactions, as illustrated by the following examples. Talks will discuss work in progress relating gauge theory and the Four-Color Theorem. The considerable computational difficulties in this project may well be more approachable from other directions, including Fukaya categories and mirror symmetry, which are the areas of expertise of several speakers, making the conference a good venue for catalyzing that interaction. Another talk will discuss recent work on equivariance in Floer cohomology, a powerful tool that should have many concrete topological applications; among the participants are leaders from the well-developed field of equivariant symplectic topology, who can contribute ideas for such applications. Higher-dimensional gauge theory is another subject that, following recent breakthroughs, seems ready for wider developments. At the conference, leading specialists from the analytic side and from Picard-Lefschetz theory will contribute their respective viewpoints.

Symplectic manifolds are spaces that carry a basic geometric structure which assigns an area to each two-dimensional plane.  Because symplectic manifolds all locally `look the same', distinguishing two of them involves global properties and measurements, such as how large a ball can be embedded into the space in an area-preserving way (this is an example of a symplectic capacity).  Fortunately, many symplectic manifolds have built-in symmetries, and the main focus in this project is the role of symmetries in symplectic geometry (especially, those symmetries that are organized into Hamiltonian group actions) and the quotient spaces that result when the symmetries are used to 'fold up' the manifold.  A key tool in studying these symmetries is the momentum map, and in this project the PI will achieve a deeper understanding of the relationship between the geometry of a Hamiltonian system and the combinatorics of the momentum image.  More broadly, the activities supported by this award will advance our knowledge in the fields of symplectic geometry and combinatorics, with applications to algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and mathematical physics.  The PI will also continue to train graduate students and mentor postdocs at Cornell, as well as continue activities which have a substantial impact on the broader mathematical community and society as large, such as giving public lectures describing `big ideas' from geometry and topology, and playing significant leadership roles in professional organizations and groups that seek to improve undergraduate mathematics education across the nation.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, Hamiltonian group actions give rise to the momentum map. This allows us to construct the symplectic reduction, which can also be described algebraically using geometric invariant theory. Pseudoholomorphic curves provide strong analytic tools to study symplectic invariants. A particularly nice package for using these tools is Hutchings' embedded contact homology (ECH). A  fundamental problem in symplectic geometry is to relate the geometry and topology of a Hamiltonian system to the combinatorics of the momentum polytope, and vice versa.  In the projects supported by this award, the PI will study questions about symplectic embedding problems, including symplectic capacities of toric 4-manifolds and rational ruled surfaces using ECH capacities. The PI's analysis will add to our understanding of topological invariants in equivariant symplectic geometry, including building a surjectivity and formality package for symplectic quotients, and a study of complexity one spaces. She is also writing a graduate textbook  introducing students and researchers to the key aspects of the field. Finally, the PI will address a number of questions in computational toric topology.  The answers will rely on tools from  a variety of fields, including algebraic  geometry, commutative algebra, and algebraic topology. This set of projects includes the study of toric folded symplectic manifolds, a close cousin of symplectic toric manifolds, and  questions about ordinary and stringy invariants of toric orbifolds."

These special shapes are called minimal surfaces and they are ubiquitous in Science, serving to model soap films, black holes in General Relativity, or tensile structures in architecture.  Moreover, they come in two types: those which are stable, i.e., if perturbed they return to their original equilibrium position and those which are unstable, i.e., if perturbed they move away from their original position.  The first type has been extensively studied in Mathematics over the last 40 years and they have been used to solve many long standing open questions in Geometry and Mathematical Relativity. The second type started being studied more systematically some years ago by Marques and the PI and they were used to solve some open problems such as the Willmore Conjecture or the problem of finding infinitely many unstable minimal surfaces. The project presented plans to continue the study of unstable minimal surfaces. Its goals are twofold: On one hand to develop the theory that governs their existence and on the other hand to study their properties as the degrees of instability become quite large because this is expected to uncover new relations across Geometry, Topology, and Analysis.<br/><br/>More precisely, the objectives of the project are to further develop the Almgren-Pitts Min-max Theory and to study the properties of minimal surfaces when seen as nonlinear eigenvalues to the volume spectrum. For the first part we aim to investigate how to bound from below the index of min-max minimal surfaces by the number of parameters and to relate that problem with the multiplicity one conjecture. An application of that result would be to solve a stronger version of a conjecture of Yau. The second objective is motivated by the recent Weyl Law for the volume spectrum that the PI proved with Marques and Liokumovich. This property suggests a stronger analogy between eigenfunctions for the Laplacian spectrum and minimal surfaces that we intend to explore and the possibility to prove Weyl Laws for many other nonlinear problems. The techniques involved combine ideas from Spectral Geometry, Morse Theory, and Minimal Surface theory."

Studying these problems may stimulate useful developments in mathematics, or lead to wider applications in science and technology. For instance, the Principal Investigator's work on rigidity problem for surfaces may have applications for stability of complicated domes in modern architecture, or various physical frameworks. Further, various techniques which the Principal Investigator is proposing to develop could be useful in computer aided design, mathematical physics, and the emerging field of discrete differential geometry.  Finally, these problems are ideal for introducing the general public to the exciting world of modern day mathematics, and arousing the interest of beginning students in Geometry.<br/><br/>The PI's research on curves and surfaces, and more generally Riemannian submanifolds, spans a wide range of topics including isometric embeddings, h-principle theory, isoperimetric problems, geometric knot theory, polyhedral approximations, and connections with real algebraic geometry. Some recurring themes throughout these investigations are various notions of convexity or optimization, and the interaction between geometric and topological concepts, or local versus global properties of submanifolds. More specifically, a typical problem is how restrictions on curvature, intrinsic metric, or various boundary conditions, influence the global shape of a curve or a hypersurface, or even allow an embedding of that object in a Euclidean space of low codimension. A fundamental problem in this area is that of isometric rigidity of surfaces: can one continuously deform a smooth closed surface in Euclidean space without changing its intrinsic metric? The PI also considers a number of related problems involving the self-linking number or vertices of closed curves, spherical images of closed surfaces, and various deformations of submanifolds which preserve the sign or magnitude of the curvature. Other projects include unfoldings of convex polytopes, and the study of the cut locus or medial axis of contractible regions in Euclidean space."

General relativity is a geometric theory of gravity; in this theory the effects of gravity are due to the curvature of the universe. The gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods.  In very general terms, this project is concerned with the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific interest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These theories provide a method for studying the relationship among three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and light cones).<br/> <br/>An initial data set in a spacetime consists of a smooth spacelike hypersurface, its induced metric and second fundamental form.  The principal investigator (PI) will continue his investigations concerning asyptotically flat initial data sets with horizons.  Such initial data sets model isolated gravitating systems with black holes.  In this context the PI, with various collaborators, has established results on 'topological censorship' at the initial data level, for initial data sets in three and higher dimensions.  These results establish, under natural physical assumptions, restrictions on the geometry and topology of the spatial domain of outer communication in black hole spacetimes. They rest in large measure on the rather recently developed theory of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs).  These are objects of considerable interest.   On the one hand they play an important role in the theory of black holes, and on the other, they may be viewed as natural spacetime analogues of minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry.  Although MOTS are not in general variational objects, they nevertheless turn out to have properties remarkably similar to minimal surfaces.   The work of the PI, and related results, lead to many interesting open problems that the PI will investigate, including problems concerning the topology of MOTSs and the spatial domain of outer communication, as well as problems concerning MOTS existence and rigidity phenomena, both in the compact and noncompact case.  Topological issues will benefit from a deeper understanding of the relationship between MOTSs and so-called immersed MOTSs.  The PI will also work on some problems pertaining to `time-symmetric'  (i.e., totally geodesic) initial data sets.  The PI will implement a strategy for proving a positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifolds, in the spirit of the Schoen-Yau positive mass proof in the asymptotically Euclidean case. The research has the potential to close a gap in previous positive mass proofs in the AH case.  A further aim in this direction would then be to try to use this method to obtain a proof of the Horowitz-Myers conjecture concerning the AdS soliton.  The PI will also continue on-going projects involving photon spheres and spacetime rigidity problems."

It has become clear that interesting groups of symmetries are naturally associated with many chaotic dynamical systems.  This connection makes it possible to answer some longstanding open questions in group theory, as well as in the theory of dynamical systems. For example, it was shown that dynamical systems of low complexity can be used to construct simple groups of sub-exponential growth, the existence of which was an open question for 30 years.  The principal investigator plans to use the methods of the theory of chaotic dynamical systems to solve problems in group theory and to use group theory to better understand dynamical systems. A direction which will be explored in this project is the study of relations between different measures of complexity of dynamical systems and groups: rates of growth, entropy, pattern complexity, ""finite type"" conditions, etc.<br/><br/>This project will study groups naturally associated with dynamical systems: topological full groups of dynamical systems and etale groupoids, iterated monodromy groups of self-coverings of topological spaces, holonomy groups of laminations, etc. They are often exotic from the point of view of ""classical"" group theory and are good sources of interesting examples, especially from the point of view of asymptotic properties of groups (for example amenability and growth). New topological and dynamical methods have proven to be effective tools in the study of such groups. For instance, almost all currently known examples of non-elementary amenable groups are constructed and studied using topological dynamical systems. This research program aims to shed new light on several group theoretic questions using topological dynamics and etale groupoids, and to work on some long-standing open questions (for example, on possible slow intermediate word growth, amenability of groups, new examples of torsion groups, constructing finitely presented groups with exotic properties, studying growth of iterated monodromy groups of quadratic polynomials, etc.).  The PI also anticipate that group theory will be effective in studying problems in dynamical systems."

Yet most existing literature in geometry deal with smooth geometric objects such as a plane, a sphere, a saddle surface and their generalizations.  In this NSF funded project, the PI proposes to study singular geometry by analyzing maps into and between them that are optimal in the sense that they minimize energy.  The analysis of these maps will help us understand symmetry properties that exists in certain singular spaces.  The project will advance our scientific knowledge in the understanding of non-singular geometry; in particular, the PI's research will lead to a greater understanding of the natural world.  The project also has an education component and supports diversity by teaching and advising graduate students, post-doc and early career mathematicians especially those that are underrepresented in the STEM fields.  <br/> <br/>A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces is defined by measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain and then integrating.  Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional.  They can be seen as both a generalization of harmonic functions in complex analysis and a higher dimensional analogue of parametrized geodesics in Riemannian geometry.  Next to totally geodesic maps, harmonic maps are perhaps the most natural way to map a given geometric space into another.  The celebrated work of Eells and Sampson launched an explosion of research in harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds.  Many important applications were found, particularly in minimal surface theory, Teichmuller theory and rigidity questions.  A more recent development is the harmonic map theory for non-smooth spaces.  The seminal works of Gromov-Schoen and Korevaar-Schoen  study energy minimizing maps in the case when the target is an non-positively curved (NPC) space. These energy minimizing maps are referred to as harmonic maps.  The PI will extend this harmonic map theory for singular geometry and to apply it to solve problems in other fields."

The program will bring together doctoral students, promising young researchers, and leading experts to discuss spectacular recent developments in the nexus of geometric analysis and general relativity, to assess new avenues for investigations, to support existing collaborations, and to promote new ones.  In recent years, gravitational wave experiments such as that of LIGO have seen striking advances, confirming phenomena anticipated by general relativity (Einstein's theory of gravitation).  These developments have led to a new surge of activity in the study of cosmological models, black holes, and other areas in the field.  The summer school is designed to introduce aspects of the field to graduate students and other junior investigators, and at the conference participants will learn about a range of current research questions.  The ESI program affords young researchers the opportunity to enhance the development of their research program through interaction with established and emerging leaders in the field.  This grant will provide support for graduate students and other junior investigators from the U.S. interested in attending the conference and/or summer school, and who would otherwise be unable to do so without this support.  <br/><br/>The study of the Einstein equations as a model for gravitational phenomena involves deep and fundamental relationships between geometric analysis and physics.  Spectacular progress has been made in recent years on several fronts, including the study of wave equations on black hole space-times (with the eventual goal of understanding black hole stability), cosmic censorship, dynamical formation of black holes in vacuum, topology of black holes, and a better understanding of the moduli space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations that govern geometry of initial data for the Cauchy problem.  Recent advances in numerical analysis of gravitational phenomena highlight the need to push the theoretical boundaries of the initial value formulation (both in constructing solutions to the constraints and in understanding the evolution of these initial data sets) and to create a bridge between the researchers in these areas.  The purpose of the summer school and conference is to introduce graduate students and other junior investigators to the tools needed to approach such results and to frame some outstanding open problems in the field.

In symplectic geometry -- the geometry of phase spaces of classical mechanics -- points are ""too small"" to be relevant, and it is more natural to consider a class of half-dimensional subspaces called Lagrangian submanifolds. Considering the geometry of these submanifolds, rather than points, naturally gives rise to a noncommutative space: the Fukaya category. A remarkable mathematical conjecture inspired by ideas from theoretical physics, ""homological mirror symmetry,"" asserts that many Fukaya categories are in fact equivalent to conventional commutative spaces such as those studied in algebraic geometry. The main goal of this research project is to expand the range of settings to which mirror symmetry is applicable. <br/><br/>Specifically, the goal is to establish homological mirror symmetry in a broad enough setting to exhibit all (commutative) algebraic spaces defined by systems of polynomial equations as instances of Fukaya categories. A key step in this program is to study the non-commutative geometry that arises from a symplectic manifold equipped with one or more (commuting) functions.  More specifically, the main goal of this project is to prove Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture for all complete intersections in (possibly noncompact) toric varieties. The mirror spaces in this setting are so-called toric Landau-Ginzburg models (i.e., noncompact toric Calabi-Yau varieties equipped with regular functions). A key ingredient in the study of their Fukaya categories is the concept of simultaneous admissibility with respect to a collection of toric monomials. This gives a new approach to the Floer-theoretic calculations needed to prove homological mirror symmetry. The expected outcome will be a framework for understanding mirror symmetry that places varieties of general type (including noncompact ones) on the same footing as the more classical Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. This project will also investigate some apparently new structural features of Fukaya categories for Landau-Ginzburg models and for affine varieties, which suggest previously unnoticed functoriality properties of homological mirror symmetry, as well as a new approach to computations for affine varieties."

Taubes<br/><br/>The immediate goal for the project is to develop new tools and methods to study the structure of three and four dimensional spaces. Questions about these spaces are central to much of current research in both geometry and topology (not to mention physics and astrophysics/cosmology - four dimensions is relevant because space with time is four dimensional).  There exist powerful mathematical tools for studying these spaces, but more tools are needed.  This is especially true for four dimensional spaces because the ignorance here is broad and deep. This lack of information motivates the project to develop new tools and sharpen the old ones while keeping in mind the long term goal of understanding more about the spaces involved. The research to be carried out could construct bridges between the fields of topology, differential geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  Concepts from the mathematical fields of the project are now used extensively (and centrally) in condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and theories of gravity and cosmology.<br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to understand the structure of smooth, low dimensional manifolds through the following primary areas of study: (1) The behavior of sequences of solutions to certain generalizations of Seiberg-Witten equations will be studied on four dimensional manifolds.  The ultimate goal in this regard is to determine whether non-convergent sequences have pathologies that obstruct solution counting definitions of invariants that can distinguish different 4-manifolds or, when the four dimensional manifold has a boundary, distinguish different knots or links on the boundary.  (2) The structure and topological significance of the zero locus of a harmonic section of a spin bundle that is defined only where the section is not zero will be investigated.  This second research focus has implications for the first because harmonic sections of the sort described arise in the study of sequences of solutions to certain equations of interest.  (3) The third research focus will look for invariants that could distinguish path components of the space of Riemannian metrics on a 4-manifold with anti-self dual Weyl curvature.  Of particular interest would be an invariant that distinguishes the products of a circle with hyperbolic three-dimensional manifolds because an invariant that does this might distinguish certain pairs of homeomorphic, but not necessarily diffeomorphic, four dimensional manifolds that can not be separated with existing tools for smooth structures.  All of these topics use methods from differential geometry and analysis to construct new tools for studying the differential topology of low dimensional manifolds."

The conference focuses on modern developments in global Riemannian geometry and the relationship between global metric geometry and topology. In the recent past these fields were very important in several breakthroughs in mathematics. For example, methods from both geometric analysis and metric geometry were crucial for the proof of the famous Poincaré conjecture, which goes back to the year 1900 and is the only one of the Millennium Prize problems to be solved to date.  These areas of mathematics also have many applications, for example to physics, chemistry, engineering, and big data analysis.  This funding will help to involve early-career mathematicians, including graduate students and postdocs. Special attention will be devoted to identifying and supporting women and other members of underrepresented groups.  There will be speaking opportunities for junior researchers and graduate students, as well as a full day of introductory talks with the goal of attracting a broader audience.  The conference will include speakers and participants who work in several research areas, thus further encouraging cross-collaborations.      <br/><br/>The conference will feature eleven plenary speakers with plenty of time between talks to encourage discussion and the interchange of ideas.  Additionally, there will be three talks given by graduate students. The technical areas represented by the conference include several areas of global Riemannian geometry: symmetries of spaces with lower curvature bounds, special Riemannian metrics (especially Einstein metrics, Kähler metrics, and warped products), families of harmonic self-maps of spheres, foliations of spheres, projective and conformal geometry, homogeneous Ricci flow and isometric flow on orbit spaces, isoparametric hypersurfaces, path spaces, and closed geodesics. The overlap between these areas makes very real the possibility for cross-collaboration among the participants, and the conference activities will bring together leading experts and young researchers and students, facilitating the dissemination of recent research progress and discussion of future directions and open problems.<br/><br/>The conference webpage is available at:  http://palmer.wellesley.edu/~geom-conf/"

A main goal is to bring experts from these two different frameworks together in order to exchange ideas and develop techniques for a unified approach.  <br/><br/>The conference will focus on the prototypes for the discrete and continuous settings, namely, graphs and manifolds.  Both settings have an associated Laplacian and Dirichlet form which is non-local in the case of graphs and strongly local in the manifold case.  Thus, while there are many commonalities in terms of set-up and questions asked, the techniques are often quite different with no direct analogues between the two.  Recent advances in notions of curvature and intrinsic metrics in the discrete setting have lead to a better conceptual understanding of the similarities and differences between these two settings; however, a unified perspective is still incomplete.<br/><br/>The conference website can be found at:  http://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/graphentheorie/events/conference/"
