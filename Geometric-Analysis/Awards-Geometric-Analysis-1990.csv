One will continue his investigation of                  geometric aspects of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and the                    relationship between quantum field theory and low-dimensional                   topology.  A second will continue an ongoing investigation of the               harmonic map equation and its connections with Poisson-Lie                      structures and quantum groups.  She will also investigate the                   Yang-Mills functional in dimensions larger than four.  A third                  investigator will study the knot types of periodic orbits in the                Lorenz attractor.

Differential equations relate the rate of change of one or more                 variables with respect to each other, or with respect to time.                  Topology is the mathematical study of shape.  Both of these areas               have a long history of use in mathematical physics."

This will include an                  analysis of the semiclassical measure on moduli space with                      fermions added, and Donaldson invariants in terms of differential               forms.  He will also investigate a general approach to                          establishing the existence of non-minimal Yang-Mills fields on 4-               manifolds with symmetry.                                                             In the early 1980s S.K.Donaldson showed the intimate                       connection between solutions of the Yang-Mills equations and                    differentiable structures on four-dimensional space.  This                      discovery meant that two four-dimensional space-times could be                  topologically the same (have the same shape) but be                             differentiably distinct.  No experiments have been devised to                   discover which of these differentiable structures describes our                 space-time.

The principal                   investigator will study a general theory for polyhedra in 3-                    dimensional space including self-intersecting polyhedra and those               with self-intersecting faces.

The mathematical object known as a torus has the shape of an               inner tube and is positively curved on the outer parts, while                   negatively curved around the hole.  As a fact, its total                        curvature is zero.  A long time ago mathematicians learned that                 this meant, with a different concept of distance, the torus can                 appear flat.  The principal investigator will continue his                      research into analogous problems concerning such prescribed                     curvature on higher-dimensional manifolds."

The principal                      investigator will extend his results on iterated integrals and                  the Witten current for the Dirac operator developed under the                   previous grant to the setting of supersymmetric conformal field                 theory.

Classical field theory involves assigning to each point of                 four-dimensional space-time a vector or scalar quantity such as                 the electrical field or temperature.  In quantum field theory                   usually some sort of operator or function is assigned to each                   point in space-time.  Using inner products, from these operators                an observable quantity may result which then can be checked by                  repeated experimentation.  In this project subtle properties of                 quantum fields will be investigated using infinite dimensional                  hypersurfaces and a mathematician's tool known as loop spaces."
