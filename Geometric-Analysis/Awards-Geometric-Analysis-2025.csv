The PI will consider the case of hyperbolic 3-manifolds as well as hyperbolic manifolds in higher dimensions with an emphasis on those constructed via arithmetic methods. The second research goal of the project is to explore the virtual properties of certain classes of groups which generalize and extend fundamental groups of hyperbolic manifolds. The PI will consider questions on the subgroup structure of these groups and their geometric actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The school will be held the at the CIRM-Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques near Marseille, France, while the two workshops will take place at the IHP. This school will offer an opportunity for US based graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to learn a variety of topics on higher rank geometric structures from international experts. The two workshops will bring together researchers throughout the world and give the US based attendees a venue to exchange ideas and make connections with their European and international colleagues. The primary focus of the award is to support travel for early career US-based mathematicians.<br/><br/>The study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups has a long history with connections to many different areas of mathematics including geometry, dynamics and number theory. Some of the earliest advances in the field (of Mostow, Margulis, Ratner) were about characterizing rigidity. For example, showing that a group is isomorphic to a unique lattice in a Lie group. On the other hand, Teichmüller theory and Thurston?s theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds involved studying the deformation theory of hyperbolic 2 and 3-manifolds. While Thurston developed this theory in the 70?s (depending heavily on the earlier work of the Ahlfors-Bers school) this deformation theory of flexible groups was largely undeveloped outside of these two examples. This changed two decades ago when Labourie introduced the notion of an Anosov subgroup and Fock- Goncharov gave coordinates for studying certain discrete representations of surface groups in semi-simple Lie groups. Since then, the subject has grown immensely and attracted a multitude of researchers. This award will give the opportunity to early career mathematicians from the US to learn from and interact with experts from all over the world who are leading the field. <br/><br/>Further information about the school and workshops can be found at the website: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11551/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project deals with the recent resurgence of integrable systems in the context of algebraic geometry and representation theory, motivated by the study of quantum field theories. The results of the research are expected to elucidate the phenomenon of three-dimensional mirror symmetry originally discovered in theoretical physics. Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education. The PI will also co-organize several conferences designed for early-career researchers. The project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis program, the Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project deals with the geometric realization of several points of view on the Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable systems. One approach uses quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations emerging naturally in the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties. Another one relies on the study of QQ-systems, generalizing the relations satisfied by the Baxter operators. The geometric realization of QQ-systems is derived from the properties of the difference equation version of oper connections on the projective line, generalizing the correspondence between oper connections and Bethe equations for the Gaudin model. The PI plans to show how these geometric points of view on the Bethe ansatz are bonded together within the framework of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence. This is expected to lead to new results in the study of the mathematical formulation of three-dimensional mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1970 and are known as one of the oldest and most prestigious mathematics conferences in the southeastern United States. This event is expected to draw 40-50 participants and will include local and regional, national and international researchers and graduate students. One of the primary goals of the Barrett Lectures is to bring prominent researchers working in active areas to Knoxville, as a service to the southeastern region of the country as well as the national mathematics community. The conferences invite a range of mathematicians, from established experts to early career researchers and graduate students, to attack the biggest challenges in the area of mapping class groups and the newly emerged field of big mapping class groups. <br/><br/>The topic of the 2025 Barrett Lectures has the advantage of a broad appeal to researchers at universities throughout the country who are exploring a range of problems and techniques in the current development of geometry and dynamics of non-positively curved groups.  Participants will present and learn about breakthrough results in the area of low dimensional topology and geometric group theory, such as the first examples of purely pseudo-Anosov closed surface groups in a mapping class group. The topics covered will include large scale geometry of Teichmuller space, random walks in non-positively curved groups, surface subgroups of mapping class groups, algorithmic problems in Out(Fn) and coarse geometry of large mapping class groups.

These questions can be completely expressed in the precise language of mathematics as conjectures about the behavior of solutions to a set of differential equations known as the Einstein equations, equations first written down in 1915. The project will thus further contribute to the venerable tradition of rigorous mathematics making fundamental statements about the nature of our physical world, a tradition which over the centuries has proven central to advances in science and technology. The subject of black holes and spacetime singularities continues to inspire the popular imagination well beyond the confines of the scientific community, as was apparent most recently in the public reception of the first stunning images of the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to answer fundamental mathematical questions about gravitational collapse in general relativity, including the dynamic formation and stability of rapidly rotating and extremal black holes and the structure and stability of spacetime singularities. The first major objective of the project is to probe the extremal black hole formation threshold, also addressing the full nonlinear stability problem for the subextremal case. The project's second major objective concerns probing the presence and stability of strong, spacelike portions of the singular boundary of black holes arising in gravitational collapse without symmetry. Finally, the project's third major objective aims to prove stability and instability results of vacuum naked singularities, exploring further the problem of critical collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
