This project focuses on 2-dimensional spaces called surfaces, which are fundamental in many areas of mathematics.  Surfaces can be flat, like a piece of paper, or curved, like the outside of a ball, a donut, or a saddle, and the various shapes they take often strongly constrain the shapes of the higher dimensional spaces in which they live.  The educational portion of this project involves a variety of activities aimed at recruiting and supporting marginalized students into mathematics.  The first part continues a series of workshops featuring mini-courses by early career speakers from underrepresented groups on their cutting-edge research aimed at graduate students. The second part establishes a series of undergraduate research and recruitment events connecting undergraduate mathematics researchers in Southern California with graduate recruiters from programs in the region.  The third part is a Topical Pedagogy Seminar which will provide graduate students and postdocs training in incorporating topical material into foundational mathematics courses.<br/><br/>A remarkable and ubiquitous example of this mathematical phenomenon is a surface bundle, which just like a donut, can be sliced so that the cross-sections are surfaces. Unlike a donut, however, as one moves through most surface bundles, the surface cross-sections can twist and deform in complicated ways.  This twisting?which essentially determines the bundle?is encoded in the mapping class group, which, among other things, is the collection of all symmetries of the space of shapes that a surface can take, also known as Teichmüller space.  The first part of the research program aims to develop a powerful fleet of combinatorial techniques for studying the geometry of mapping class groups and Teichmüller spaces, as well as their structure at infinity.  The second part focuses on the geometry of surface bundles arising naturally from dynamics.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project will investigate the coarse geometry of the mapping class group, Teichmüller space, and surface bundles using the tools of geometric group theory.  The first part aims to address a family of results showing that mapping class groups can be coherently locally modeled by CAT(0) cube complexes, allowing for the construction of new metrics with a variety of applications, including about their geometry and topology at infinity.  The second part studies the geometry of surface bundles of Veech surfaces and their combinations, as well as developing a Sullivan-like notion of structural stability for the subgroups associated to a variety of surface bundles with nice curvature properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Summer School will feature seven mini-courses on a variety of topics in discrete subgroups of Lie groups. Each mini-course will be organized into units of 2-3 hours of a lecture followed by a problem session. This will allow each lecturer to properly introduce their topic to non-experts, including graduate students and postdocs, and allow the participants to acquaint themselves in a reasonably detailed way with the techniques used to attack central problems.

At the heart lies the discovery that the Mostow?Margulis type rigidity results for discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups have far-reaching counterparts in geometry and dynamics. Investigations in this area are often spurred by the sudden emergence of or deepening of connections to other areas of mathematics. Recently,  new developments have been occurring at lightning speed.  This school will highlight the remarkable progress on several important problems broadly centered around the study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups.

This project will focus on constructions and classifications of such complex manifolds. The results will deepen our understanding of the geometry of complex manifolds as a whole and more broadly will further advance our knowledge through connections to other subjects ranging from algebraic geometry, topology, and analysis to physics.

On the other hand, the analogous collapsing Calabi-Yau picture has many applications, including to physics. These two programs fit into a common framework, each with a given singularity model (respectively Kähler-Ricci solitons and complete non-compact Calabi-Yau metrics) and a corresponding type of degeneration (respectively the Kähler-Ricci flow and families of collapsing Calabi-Yau manifolds).

The primary focus of the award is to support travel for early career US-based mathematicians.<br/><br/>The study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups has a long history with connections to many different areas of mathematics including geometry, dynamics and number theory. Some of the earliest advances in the field (of Mostow, Margulis, Ratner) were about characterizing rigidity. For example, showing that a group is isomorphic to a unique lattice in a Lie group. On the other hand, Teichmüller theory and Thurston?s theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds involved studying the deformation theory of hyperbolic 2 and 3-manifolds. While Thurston developed this theory in the 70?s (depending heavily on the earlier work of the Ahlfors-Bers school) this deformation theory of flexible groups was largely undeveloped outside of these two examples. This changed two decades ago when Labourie introduced the notion of an Anosov subgroup and Fock- Goncharov gave coordinates for studying certain discrete representations of surface groups in semi-simple Lie groups. Since then, the subject has grown immensely and attracted a multitude of researchers. This award will give the opportunity to early career mathematicians from the US to learn from and interact with experts from all over the world who are leading the field. <br/><br/>Further information about the school and workshops can be found at the website: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11551/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project deals with the recent resurgence of integrable systems in the context of algebraic geometry and representation theory, motivated by the study of quantum field theories. The results of the research are expected to elucidate the phenomenon of three-dimensional mirror symmetry originally discovered in theoretical physics. Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education. The PI will also co-organize several conferences designed for early-career researchers. The project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis program, the Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project deals with the geometric realization of several points of view on the Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable systems. One approach uses quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations emerging naturally in the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties. Another one relies on the study of QQ-systems, generalizing the relations satisfied by the Baxter operators. The geometric realization of QQ-systems is derived from the properties of the difference equation version of oper connections on the projective line, generalizing the correspondence between oper connections and Bethe equations for the Gaudin model. The PI plans to show how these geometric points of view on the Bethe ansatz are bonded together within the framework of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence. This is expected to lead to new results in the study of the mathematical formulation of three-dimensional mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions can be completely expressed in the precise language of mathematics as conjectures about the behavior of solutions to a set of differential equations known as the Einstein equations, equations first written down in 1915. The project will thus further contribute to the venerable tradition of rigorous mathematics making fundamental statements about the nature of our physical world, a tradition which over the centuries has proven central to advances in science and technology. The subject of black holes and spacetime singularities continues to inspire the popular imagination well beyond the confines of the scientific community, as was apparent most recently in the public reception of the first stunning images of the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to answer fundamental mathematical questions about gravitational collapse in general relativity, including the dynamic formation and stability of rapidly rotating and extremal black holes and the structure and stability of spacetime singularities. The first major objective of the project is to probe the extremal black hole formation threshold, also addressing the full nonlinear stability problem for the subextremal case. The project's second major objective concerns probing the presence and stability of strong, spacelike portions of the singular boundary of black holes arising in gravitational collapse without symmetry. Finally, the project's third major objective aims to prove stability and instability results of vacuum naked singularities, exploring further the problem of critical collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
