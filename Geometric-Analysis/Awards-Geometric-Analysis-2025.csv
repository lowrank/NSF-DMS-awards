Participants will meet over a long weekend to learn about and disseminate important new developments in geometry and topology, with a special focus on symplectic geometry and adjacent areas. The Symplectothon will also make a concentrated effort to build the local regional network, by forging and strengthening in-person bonds and potential collaborations. Each Symplectothon workshop will focus on a specific emerging topic, and participants will typically consist of 20-30 graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and senior faculty from an array of institutions in the greater Southern California region. There will be one or two in-person invited experts and a similar number of virtual invited experts. Participants will stay together in a single dedicated location, and talks will be given by the participants, with plenary lectures by the invited experts. Each Symplectothon will also include several guided discussion and Q+A sessions, as well as a forward-looking talk on future directions by one of the invited experts. Outside of the intensive scientific programming schedule, participants will have ample time for open discussions, while building personal and professional ties through social activities such as collective cooking, hikes, and other outdoor activities.<br/><br/>The chosen topics for Symplectothon 2025 include Lagrangian fillings and cluster algebras. Participants will learn about Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian knots, cluster algebras, and microlocal sheaves, culminating in recent deep connections between these, particularly the work of Casals?Gao which establishes the existence of Legendrian knots with infinitely many distinct Lagrangian fillings and separately shows that every cluster seed in the augmentation variety arises from a Lagrangian filling. This is an exciting and interdisciplinary area under active development, and Symplectothon 2025 will be designed to bring Southern California geometers up to the research forefront. It will create an opportunity for researchers from different scientific backgrounds (i.e. symplectic geometry and cluster algebras) to convene and learn from each other. The participants will also learn about and discuss many other potential applications, such as the recent construction of cluster structures on braid varieties using ideas from symplectic topology, as well as many possible future connections between symplectic topology and cluster algebra. The tentatively chosen topic for Symplectothon 2026 is ""tropical curve counts beyond toric geometry"". A dedicated Symplectothon website with application information, syllabi, and typed lecture notes will be maintained at https://kylersiegel.xyz/symplectothon.html.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, spaces are considered the same if one can be transformed into the other without cutting or gluing. One is often interested in computing algebraic invariants which can distinguish spaces up to this equivalence. One such invariant is homology, which lets one study the shape of spaces using linear algebra. In low dimensions, homology measures very concrete aspects of a space; for instance it detects the number of loops in a graph or the number of holes in a surface. In high dimensions, it measures more complicated features, and is generally more difficult to compute. The PI will study several long-standing conjectures on the topology of aspherical manifolds, as well as recent breakthroughs connecting homology growth to various aspects of fibering. This project will also promote graduate and undergraduate education through the writing of a textbook on L^2-homology and the development of new Vertically Integrated Research courses at Louisiana State University. <br/><br/>The primary goal of the research program is to study the growth of homology (with various coefficients) in a residual tower of finite regular covers of an aspherical manifold. One of the motivating conjectures is that for a large class of closed, aspherical manifolds, sublinear homology growth in all degrees and all field coefficients implies that the manifold has a finite cover which fibers over the circle. This is a key step towards developing a high-dimensional analogue of Agol's Virtual Fibering Theorem ?in dimension 3. In one direction, the PI plans to construct closed, aspherical Gromov hyperbolic manifolds of any odd dimension which have nontrivial F_p-homology growth. The PI will also study fibering  (and various group theoretic analogues) for Gromov-Thurston manifolds and other classical examples. In a related direction, the PI will continue work on Singer conjecture's on vanishing of L^2-homology groups for certain locally CAT(0) cubulated manifolds. In the final part of the project, the PI will investigate Atiyah's conjecture on integrality of L^2-Betti numbers for some classes of Artin groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TDA has emerged as a powerful framework for capturing the intrinsic shape of data and now informs work in areas such as biology, machine learning, and materials science. Because the field is evolving rapidly across theory, algorithms, and real-world use cases, the program aims to balance cutting-edge theory with demonstrations of practical impact across disciplines. A central goal is to train the next generation of TDA researchers by featuring lectures and presentations from internationally recognized experts, as well as offering oral and poster presentation opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers?an arrangement that accelerates knowledge transfer, broadens participation, and provides early-career mathematicians and scientists with valuable professional experience and networking opportunities.<br/> <br/>The three-day agenda features keynote and invited talks, short parallel oral sessions, and poster presentations around various themes of TDA such as (1) multiparameter persistence; (2) Mobius inversion techniques in TDA; (3) spectral methods in TDA; and (4) applications across disciplines. By gathering leading theorists with practitioners who apply these ideas to real data, the conference will both advance fundamental understanding of topological data analysis and accelerate its practical use across disciplines, ensuring that mathematical insight continues to fuel innovation.

The workshop will focus on the study of groups, which are collections of transformations of objects that preserve certain geometric properties. The workshop will bring together leading experts to share recent advancements and explore new research directions. The interdisciplinary nature of the workshop, combined with the broader thematic semester, will facilitate communication among U.S. students and leading experts across multiple mathematical fields and enhance STEM education at the undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/> <br/>The topic of the workshop is studying groups via their actions on graphs and metric spaces that satisfy various notions of non-positive curvature, such as the CAT(0) condition introduced by Alexandrov and the hyperbolicity condition defined by Gromov.

These insights, initially motivated by the dynamics of the solar system, became a far-reaching theory in areas of math both near and far to physics. Today mathematicians and scientists often study flows in manifolds, in which points travel in intricate orbits constrained by the overall shape of the manifold, as well as foliations, which are decompositions of a manifold into lower-dimensional slices like leaves of a layered pastry. This project aims to study such phenomena and build the understanding of the intricate connections between geometry and dynamics which occur especially in ""low dimensional"" settings such as surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds. Experience has shown that these low-dimensional settings, amenable to visual and geometric intuition, are also a valuable testing ground and provide inspiration for many more general phenomena within and outside of mathematics. Graduate students funded by the grant will, in addition to their research work, be trained in mathematics education and outreach, preparing them for contributions to society through higher education and other leadership roles. Additional activities of the PI and his students and collaborators will include public educational events for local school children and their families, bringing cutting-edge mathematical knowledge to the greater New Haven community.<br/> <br/>In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will explore a number of connections among foliations, flows, dynamics and hyperbolic geometry in low dimensions. One topic will be the topological dynamics of horospherical flows in infinite-volume manifolds. Building on recent successes of the PI and coauthors in the case of Z-covers of compact surfaces, the project will seek to extend results to higher rank abelian covers, higher dimensions and other generalizations.  The PI also plans to revisit connections between two mature subjects in the setting of 3-manifolds: hyperbolic geometry on one hand and the topology and dynamics of taut foliations and pseudo-Anosov flows on the other. The goal here is to obtain a more robust and uniform theory relating topological features of foliations and flows to geometric features of the hyperbolic metric. In a third direction, the PI will study problems associated to Thurston's skinning map and the construction of uniform models for hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A motivating conjecture here is a uniform bound on Thurston's skinning map under certain topological hypotheses, for which the PI and coauthors have a promising line of attack.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phenomenological implications are being actively explored in the physical community, while lessons from the development of strings continually inform and improve our ability to apply physics to various problems such as the calculation of particle scattering or even the interaction of light with black holes.  On the mathematical side, advances have continued apace for decades since the ?second string revolution? incorporated extended states known as ?branes.?  These objects ? which include black holes as a special case ? have mathematical treatments that span a vast range of subjects from differential geometry and symplectic geometry to representation theory, sheaf theory and category theory.  But once you have a brane, you can move it around and there are interesting families of branes.  Since the overarching theory is quantum mechanical, points in these families behave like quantum particles, meaning the families get quantized.  Algebraically, the quantization procedure has been explored by mathematicians in general, but quantization of brane moduli often has a richer, specific structure that can be revealed in examples.  The projects in this grant explore these structures.<br/><br/>Specifically, several projects will advance our understanding of quantization of brane moduli spaces.  These include the moduli of augmentations of Legendrian knots, whose quantization can recover quantum groups in this setting.  Brane moduli spaces have been quantized and connected to all-genus open Gromov-Witten invariants, and one project explores an upgrade of this from quantum tori to quantum character varieties through the skein algebras.  Another project investigates the quantization of periods ? which measure brane moduli ? and connects the result to enumerative invariants.  Other projects involve q-difference equations and constructible sheaves.  All the while, PI Zaslow will continue to supervise graduate students, run seminars, and disseminate results at conferences, workshops and seminars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Euclidean geometry has applications to architecture, engineering, computer science and crystallography, as well as various branches of modern mathematics. The other two geometries are Spherical and Hyperbolic. Spherical geometry is central to the study of geophysics and astronomy, and crucial for navigation. Hyperbolic geometry has modern applications to the theory of special relativity in Physics as well as Art and Design. Global Riemannian Geometry generalizes these three geometries, all of which have constant curvature, that is, the way in which they ""bend"" does not change. In particular, this area of mathematics provides a framework to study spaces of varying curvature. One of the major challenges in this area of study is to understand how local geometric invariants such as curvature relate to global topological invariants such as fundamental group, which indicates whether or not the space has 1-dimensional ""holes"". Manifolds with curvature bounds have been studied intensively since the conception of Global Riemannian geometry. Over the last 30 years, one approach to the study of manifolds with lower curvature bounds has been the introduction of symmetries and is the main focus of this project. The PI will also continue her outreach work with middle and high school students, as well as graduate training, and the organization of workshops and conferences.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will pursue a program in which she carefully studies and analyzes symmetries of Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bounds, considering sectional, Ricci, scalar, and the intermediate curvatures that interpolate between sectional and Ricci and between sectional and scalar, and some of their corresponding generalizations to Alexandrov spaces, with an eye to gaining a deeper understanding of this largely unknown class of spaces. She will study not only how continuous and discrete symmetries relate to the topology of such spaces but also try to find new examples of Riemannian manifolds of positive Ricci curvature and almost non-negative sectional curvature using symmetries and topology as tools to do so.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project also incorporates the training of graduate students, and organizing activities such as seminars and conferences as well as outreach to the local elementary schools.<br/> <br/>One of the two main directions of the project is to further our geometric understanding of singular Kahler-Einstein spaces. In particular, a goal is to show that such spaces always satisfy the RCD property, which leads to many geometric consequences. Eventually such results will lead to new geometric approaches to questions about singular varieties in algebraic geometry. The other main direction is the study of singularities along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. This high codimension mean curvature flow is so far little understood, but conjecturally has important applications to the study of special Lagrangian submanifolds and mirror symmetry. A major goal of the project is to show that generically only very simple singularities can form along the flow, in analogy with recent progress on the mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They give mathematical models for chaotic motion (sensitivity of outcomes or trajectories to initial conditions), but at the same time exhibit robust global behavior.  This confluence of chaos and stability makes them particularly interesting for study and an important mathematical entry-point to understanding the theory behind such physical phenomena.  This project will describe and classify all the Anosov flows on three-dimensional spaces, a problem which has been open and of interest since the 1960s.  There are already many known examples in the three dimensional space, and the project will show how the dynamics of these various examples of flows are related to geometrical features of the space.  Broader impacts include mentorship and training of early career researchers, building new bridges between different areas of mathematics, such as geometry, topology and dynamics, and a workshop to improve communication by mathematicians.  <br/><br/>The technical goals of this project focus on constructing a dictionary relating the topology and geometry of the foliations associated to an Anosov (or pseudo-Anosov) flow on a 3-manifold with the structure of the 3-manifold and the dynamics of the flow.  This builds on previous work of the PI, which used a dimension-reduction technique to translate the classification problem for flows into one for ""Anosov-like group actions"" on the plane, and then translate results back from the plane to the 3-manifold.  The project  will carry out a detailed study of such actions to produce new invariants for classification and solve open conjectures such as the finiteness problem.  In doing so, the project will also deepen our understanding of the relationship between actions of discrete groups on the plane and the circle, and continuous flows on 3-manifolds, providing new links between dynamics and low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The novel mathematical methods developed in this project rely on a geometric approach, based on the manipulation of a new type of diagrams introduced by the Principal Investigator, that bypasses brute force computations in favor of quicker and clearer qualitative understanding. The results of this project lead to more efficient predictions of the behavior of rays of light and the evolution of heat, thus allowing for a wider range of scientific applications.

The broader impacts of this project include a series of intensive workshops and seminars aimed at training the current generation of early career mathematicians, and two new research monographs streamlining some of the most useful and recent developments in the area, making them accessible and usable to the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the two major goals of the project are the study of Legendrian submanifolds and their Lagrangian fillings, and the development of applications of Lagrangian submanifolds. The project addresses geometric and algebraic properties of the moduli space of Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian submanifolds, and the construction and manipulation of combinatorial structures from Lagrangian submanifolds. The project includes new applications of these goals to cluster algebras, mathematical physics and algebraic combinatorics. The advent of sheaf-theoretic techniques has now opened a wide variety of questions on Legendrian submanifolds, specifically via the study of their moduli spaces of Lagrangian fillings. In this project, we study the classification of Lagrangian fillings of a given Legendrian submanifold, including the derived geometry of their moduli, incarnated by the space of sheaves singularly supported on that Legendrian. In addition, we develop of a series of constructions connecting the symplectic geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds to other areas of mathematics, including algebraic combinatorics and string theory.

The usual direction is to study the set of symmetries of a geometric object of interest.  In geometric group theory, this becomes a two-way street in that algebraic objects (such as groups) are considered as geometric objects in their own right.  Hyperbolic geometry is a subject going back to work of Bolyai, Gauss and others in the 19th Century, but it also plays a central role in modern geometry, particularly due to the influence of Thurston and Gromov.  This project centers around a central question in geometric group theory, the Cannon Conjecture, about the difference (in three dimensions) between classical hyperbolic geometry and the coarse notion due to Gromov, in the presence of a large group of symmetries.  The principal investigator (PI) will expand the work of the MSCS Undergraduate Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago, extending the reach of research projects to a wide audience of students there.<br/><br/>In recent work of the PI with Haissinsky, Manning, Osajda, Sisto and Walsh, the PI has developed a theory of ?drilling? residually finite hyperbolic groups with two-sphere boundary.  This reduced the Cannon Conjecture to a relatively hyperbolic version, which should be more tractable since it corresponds to manifolds with boundary.  In this project, the PI will extend this work in three directions.  In work with Walsh, the PI will use tools from drilling to develop a coarse version of Calegari-Gabai?s Shrinkwrapping, and prove that in a residually finite hyperbolic group with  two-sphere boundary, a surface subgroup is either quasi-convex, or a virtual fiber.  In work with Manning, the PI will extend the work from the Drilling project in order to drill a graph instead of a curve, thereby reducing the Cannon Conjecture to a conjecture of Kapovich-Kleiner about hyperbolic groups with Sierpinski Carpet boundary.

One part of his proposed research, concerning optimal paper geometry, builds on his recent successful solution of the long-standing optimal paper Moebius band conjecture. Another part of the proposed research, concerning geometric dynamics, deals with simple processes which start with a shape like a polygon and apply some transformation to it over and over again.   Such processes, like the pentagram map, often have deep connections to other areas in science like water waves and physics-based integrable systems. The PI also proposes to work on a number of more exploratory projects, such as the connection between the famous four color theorem and triangulations of the sphere based on fullerenes. This project will also support the PI's continued impacts on society, through public lectures, many colorful graphical user interfaces, and children's mathematics books.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the PI hopes to prove the knotted paper Moebius conjecture, which states that any sequence of aspect ratio minimizing embedded and knotted paper Moebius bands converges, in the Hausdorff topology, to a folded ribbon knot whose underlying shape is a regular pentagon.  Relatedly, the PI hopes to prove the optimality of the newly discovered Hennessey-Neinhaus construction, which provides embeddings of paper Moebius bands with arbitrarily high twisting number and uniformly bounded aspect ratio. The conjecture is that if a rectangle can be folded in space so as to make Moebius bands of arbitrarily high twisting number, then the aspect ratio of the rectangle exceeds the square root of twenty seven. For both these results, the PI hopes to leverage additional topological constraints in a geometric way. For example, the high twisting number combined with the small aspect ratio ought to imply that the paper Moebius band must coil very tightly in certain regions, creating a kind of trap. The existence of this trap places constraints on the rest of the Moebius band, possibly leading to a lower bound on its aspect ratio. In the direction of geometric dynamics, the PI plans to continue his exploration of pentagram-like maps which act nicely on certain open subsets of the moduli space of polygons modulo projective transformations.  The next step in the analysis is to show that the orbits in these subspaces are pre-compact modulo projective transformations and to try to understand their collapse point via analogues of Glick's collapse point formula for the pentagram map.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The question of the stability of the proposed sampling result leads the PI to study the smallest singular values of the resulting matrices, which have natural applications to the signal recovery part of the proposal. Finally, the PI will develop a comprehensive approach to the spectral synthesis problem previously studied by Agmon, Agranovsky, Hormander, Narayanan, and others.

This project focuses on 2-dimensional spaces called surfaces, which are fundamental in many areas of mathematics.  Surfaces can be flat, like a piece of paper, or curved, like the outside of a ball, a donut, or a saddle, and the various shapes they take often strongly constrain the shapes of the higher dimensional spaces in which they live.  The educational portion of this project involves a variety of activities aimed at recruiting and supporting marginalized students into mathematics.  The first part continues a series of workshops featuring mini-courses by early career speakers from underrepresented groups on their cutting-edge research aimed at graduate students. The second part establishes a series of undergraduate research and recruitment events connecting undergraduate mathematics researchers in Southern California with graduate recruiters from programs in the region.  The third part is a Topical Pedagogy Seminar which will provide graduate students and postdocs training in incorporating topical material into foundational mathematics courses.<br/><br/>A remarkable and ubiquitous example of this mathematical phenomenon is a surface bundle, which just like a donut, can be sliced so that the cross-sections are surfaces. Unlike a donut, however, as one moves through most surface bundles, the surface cross-sections can twist and deform in complicated ways.  This twisting?which essentially determines the bundle?is encoded in the mapping class group, which, among other things, is the collection of all symmetries of the space of shapes that a surface can take, also known as Teichmüller space.  The first part of the research program aims to develop a powerful fleet of combinatorial techniques for studying the geometry of mapping class groups and Teichmüller spaces, as well as their structure at infinity.

By itself, this is a deterministic question, hence, it is surprising that introducing some randomness into the problem can make it easier. This project will develop and use probabilistic methods to study deterministic objects with sophisticated structure, to describe their typical behavior, what types of symmetries the structures have, and what types of models can be used to detect their properties. The PI plans to use deep tools that he and collaborators have developed in recent years to address fundamental conjectures on various types of groups that describe number theoretic, geometric, or topological properties.  The PI will lead activities to train future researchers in this active area, including the organization of a year-long emphasis year at Northwestern University with a spring school aimed at students and an international conference for experts, the organization of a special session at a major conference in January 2026, and the teaching of a research seminar aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Building on the text recently completed by the PI, he will write another book on specialized topics related to this project, and building on the experience the PI has in supervising undergraduates in a research program, the PI will direct additional cohorts of students.<br/><br/>The main techniques on which the project relies were developed in the last three years and have already proven useful. Among other problems, the PI will focus on the Margulis ergodicity conjecture (a variant of a conjecture of Schoen and Yau), the Nori problem, and the Stuck--Zimmer conjecture. In particular, the PI will build on his very recent breakthroughs in the third topic. The PI's past research had an impact on various fields including geometric and combinatorial group theory, finite groups, differential geometry, algebraic number theory, automorphic forms, representation theory, topology, operator algebras, combinatorics, computer science and theoretical physics, and future impacts are expected. Specifically, progress in the Nori problem may provide tools to distinguish between thin and arithmetic groups. Such techniques are currently unavailable but required in many situations, e.g. when studying the monodromy groups of hypergeometric equations. Solving the Stuck--Zimmer conjecture will have many applications, in particular to the study of limit multiplicity theorems and Plancherel measures associated with Hilbert--Blumenthal modular varieties. The Margulis-Schoen-Yau conjecture is significant both to the study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups and to differential geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary goal of this Summer School is to allow researchers to come together and learn about recent breakthroughs and exciting developments in this area.  The Summer School will feature seven mini-courses on a variety of topics in discrete subgroups of Lie groups. Each mini-course will be organized into units of 2-3 hours of a lecture followed by a problem session. This will allow each lecturer to properly introduce their topic to non-experts, including graduate students and postdocs, and allow the participants to acquaint themselves in a reasonably detailed way with the techniques used to attack central problems.  The primary purpose of the award is to provide travel funding to students and  scholars from the US to participate in the Summer School, so that they can learn about and participate in this  exciting research area.<br/><br/>Rigidity properties of geometric and dynamical structures under either symmetry or extremality assumptions, e.g., on curvature or entropy, have been of great interest in both geometry and dynamics, and number theory for some time. The goal typically is to force such structures to be of classical, often algebraic nature. These ideas and results build on the celebrated works of Mostow, Prasad, Margulis and Zimmer. At the heart lies the discovery that the Mostow?Margulis type rigidity results for discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups have far-reaching counterparts in geometry and dynamics. Investigations in this area are often spurred by the sudden emergence of or deepening of connections to other areas of mathematics. Recently,  new developments have been occurring at lightning speed.  This school will highlight the remarkable progress on several important problems broadly centered around the study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups.  The concentrated activity around this Summer School funded in part by this grant are crucial for capturing this momentum and spur further progress.

This project will focus on constructions and classifications of such complex manifolds. The results will deepen our understanding of the geometry of complex manifolds as a whole and more broadly will further advance our knowledge through connections to other subjects ranging from algebraic geometry, topology, and analysis to physics.

On the other hand, the analogous collapsing Calabi-Yau picture has many applications, including to physics. These two programs fit into a common framework, each with a given singularity model (respectively Kähler-Ricci solitons and complete non-compact Calabi-Yau metrics) and a corresponding type of degeneration (respectively the Kähler-Ricci flow and families of collapsing Calabi-Yau manifolds).

The main scientific goal of this conference is to bring the experts in Poisson geometry, Lie theory and their applications to the study of symmetry, as well as nearby domains, together to present the significant recent developments in each area, and discuss the open problems and challenges in each field, and create a forum for researchers to interact and collaborate. Such a unique week-long conference will help to identify and promote promising new research directions, and to immerse graduate students and junior researchers in the most current research in the fields.<br/><br/>Poisson geometry and Lie theory are related branches of differential geometry, which are both rooted deeply in mathematical formulation of classical and quantum mechanics, and the study of symmetry in physics. In the last 50 years, these areas experienced a golden period of accelerated growth with many milestone results, e.g. solutions of the Arnold conjecture, mathematical aspects of the mirror symmetry, Kontsevich?s formality theorem, etc. This conference provides a platform for researchers from these areas and nearby domains to learn the most recent advances in Poisson geometry, Lie theory and symmetry, to identify promising new directions, and to help bring graduate students and postdocs up to speed with the current frontier of the fields.

Its aim is to bring together researchers in Poisson geometry, foliation theory, and representation theory to study an array of questions related to singularity theory in the Poisson setting. The program will feature surveys on three of the most active topics in this area, followed by research talks, a series of open discussions, and several events designed to promote the engagement of early-career participants. The goal of these activities is to introduce the participants to new mathematical perspectives on Poisson singularity theory, and to create an opportunity for new interdisciplinary collaborations. The purpose of this award is to support the participation of US-based researchers in this international event.<br/><br/>The rich geometric behavior of Poisson spaces around singular points, where the rank of the Poisson bivector drops, is governed by a subtle interplay of geometric and algebraic phenomena. The workshop will focus on three interrelated problems in Poisson singularity theory: normal form theorems, deformations, and desingularization. The surveys and talks will address these problems as they occur in an array of geometric settings, including differential geometry, foliation theory, holomorphic geometry, the theory of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, algebraic geometry, and geometric representation theory. It will give participants an opportunity to apply current methods in one discipline to open problems in another, fostering a new dialogue around singularities in Poisson geometry.

The school will be held the at the CIRM-Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques near Marseille, France, while the two workshops will take place at the IHP. This school will offer an opportunity for US based graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to learn a variety of topics on higher rank geometric structures from international experts. The two workshops will bring together researchers throughout the world and give the US based attendees a venue to exchange ideas and make connections with their European and international colleagues. The primary focus of the award is to support travel for early career US-based mathematicians.<br/><br/>The study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups has a long history with connections to many different areas of mathematics including geometry, dynamics and number theory. Some of the earliest advances in the field (of Mostow, Margulis, Ratner) were about characterizing rigidity. For example, showing that a group is isomorphic to a unique lattice in a Lie group. On the other hand, Teichmüller theory and Thurston?s theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds involved studying the deformation theory of hyperbolic 2 and 3-manifolds. While Thurston developed this theory in the 70?s (depending heavily on the earlier work of the Ahlfors-Bers school) this deformation theory of flexible groups was largely undeveloped outside of these two examples. This changed two decades ago when Labourie introduced the notion of an Anosov subgroup and Fock- Goncharov gave coordinates for studying certain discrete representations of surface groups in semi-simple Lie groups. Since then, the subject has grown immensely and attracted a multitude of researchers. This award will give the opportunity to early career mathematicians from the US to learn from and interact with experts from all over the world who are leading the field. <br/><br/>Further information about the school and workshops can be found at the website: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11551/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Barrett Lectures began in 1970 as a tribute to Drs. John H. and Lida Barrett, former faculty and department heads of the Mathematics Department at the University of Tennessee. The Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1970 and are known as one of the oldest and most prestigious mathematics conferences in the southeastern United States. This event is expected to draw 40-50 participants and will include local and regional, national and international researchers and graduate students. One of the primary goals of the Barrett Lectures is to bring prominent researchers working in active areas to Knoxville, as a service to the southeastern region of the country as well as the national mathematics community. The conferences invite a range of mathematicians, from established experts to early career researchers and graduate students, to attack the biggest challenges in the area of mapping class groups and the newly emerged field of big mapping class groups. <br/><br/>The topic of the 2025 Barrett Lectures has the advantage of a broad appeal to researchers at universities throughout the country who are exploring a range of problems and techniques in the current development of geometry and dynamics of non-positively curved groups.  Participants will present and learn about breakthrough results in the area of low dimensional topology and geometric group theory, such as the first examples of purely pseudo-Anosov closed surface groups in a mapping class group. The topics covered will include large scale geometry of Teichmuller space, random walks in non-positively curved groups, surface subgroups of mapping class groups, algorithmic problems in Out(Fn) and coarse geometry of large mapping class groups. Juxtaposing discussions with different techniques has the potential to result in synergy and fresh ideas.

This project deals with the recent resurgence of integrable systems in the context of algebraic geometry and representation theory, motivated by the study of quantum field theories. The results of the research are expected to elucidate the phenomenon of three-dimensional mirror symmetry originally discovered in theoretical physics. Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education. The PI will also co-organize several conferences designed for early-career researchers. The project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis program, the Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project deals with the geometric realization of several points of view on the Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable systems. One approach uses quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations emerging naturally in the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties. Another one relies on the study of QQ-systems, generalizing the relations satisfied by the Baxter operators. The geometric realization of QQ-systems is derived from the properties of the difference equation version of oper connections on the projective line, generalizing the correspondence between oper connections and Bethe equations for the Gaudin model. The PI plans to show how these geometric points of view on the Bethe ansatz are bonded together within the framework of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence. This is expected to lead to new results in the study of the mathematical formulation of three-dimensional mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions can be completely expressed in the precise language of mathematics as conjectures about the behavior of solutions to a set of differential equations known as the Einstein equations, equations first written down in 1915. The project will thus further contribute to the venerable tradition of rigorous mathematics making fundamental statements about the nature of our physical world, a tradition which over the centuries has proven central to advances in science and technology. The subject of black holes and spacetime singularities continues to inspire the popular imagination well beyond the confines of the scientific community, as was apparent most recently in the public reception of the first stunning images of the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to answer fundamental mathematical questions about gravitational collapse in general relativity, including the dynamic formation and stability of rapidly rotating and extremal black holes and the structure and stability of spacetime singularities. The first major objective of the project is to probe the extremal black hole formation threshold, also addressing the full nonlinear stability problem for the subextremal case. The project's second major objective concerns probing the presence and stability of strong, spacelike portions of the singular boundary of black holes arising in gravitational collapse without symmetry. Finally, the project's third major objective aims to prove stability and instability results of vacuum naked singularities, exploring further the problem of critical collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
