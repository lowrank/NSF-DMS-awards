Group actions arise naturally in many areas of mathematics. For instance, group actions describe the possible symmetries of a regular polygon or, more generally, the ways to cut a polygon into pieces and reassemble into the original polygon.  The research project will apply tools from the theory of dynamical systems in order to study more general group actions on spaces.  The goal of these projects is to establish certain rigidity results showing that all actions or invariant objects are of a certain prototypical form.  During the project, the principal investigator will give summer courses on dynamical systems to high-school students and complete a number of expository writings on recent developments in rigidity of groups actions.  <br/><br/>The specific research projects include a number of projects studying actions of lattices in higher-rank Lie groups (including a number of conjectures in the Zimmer program) as well as group actions arising from geometric constructions such as actions on character varieties.  In these projects, the principal investigator intends to use a number of tools from the theory of smooth dynamical systems including nonuniform hyperbolicity, entropy theory, and the theory of normal forms to study more general group actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much research has been focused on the study of PDEs on smooth spaces, where the local geometry has a very simple model, however singularities can arise naturally in nature, the most well known being black holes. The current research project focuses on the study of PDEs on such singular spaces. This study will have applications in algebraic geometry, where singular spaces play a central role in modern research, as well as in the theory of partial differential equations. At the same time, singular spaces occur naturally as limits of families of smooth spaces, which could collapse in certain directions for instance. In this way the proposed research will shed new light on the behavior of such families. Aside from pursuing these research projects, the PI will continue training PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition the PI will also co-organize a yearly summer workshop for<br/>undergraduate students aimed at conveying ideas in geometry to them which do not typically appear in the undergraduate curriculum. The PI will also co-organize a yearly bridge program aimed at helping incoming graduate students with diverse backgrounds get up to speed, to ensure their success.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to investigate singularities in Kahler geometry from different points of view. On the one hand, singularities can arise in the limit of a sequence of smooth spaces, and it is important to understand the structure of such limit spaces. The PI will study the question of when the limit space can be identified with a singular Kahler space, building on work of Donaldson-Sun as well as Liu and the PI. Of particular interest are non-collapsed limit spaces of Kahler manifolds with Ricci curvature bounds, however the PI will also investigate the much less understood collapsed limit spaces. In a related direction, the PI will study canonical metrics, such as Kahler-Einstein metrics, on singular complex varieties, in particular the behavior of such metrics near the singular set. A good understanding of the geometry of such singular metrics would lead to applications of differential geometric techniques to the algebraic geometry of singular varieties. Finally, in relation to the collapsing theory of Kahler manifolds, the PI will study the construction of canonical metrics on fibrations that are almost collapsed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These variational problems arise in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics and also in many physical sciences.  For example, minimal surfaces arise as minima of the the area functional and provide a mathematical model of soap films. This project focuses on a geometric functional called entropy which has drawn a lot of recent interest as a natural measure of the complexity of a surface. The main tool used to study this functional is the mean curvature flow which is a dynamic process that, roughly speaking, continuously deforms a surface in a manner that decreases its area as quickly as possible.  Mean curvature flow was first studied as a model of certain phenomena in materials science and has also found applications in computer graphics and image recognition.  Furthermore, as a geometric heat flow, it is closely related to the Ricci flow which was used by Perelman to solve the Poincare conjecture. The mean curvature flow also has promising potential applications to topology - some of which are explored by this project.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will use mean curvature flow to investigate hypersurfaces in n-dimensional Euclidean space of low entropy, that is, hypersurfaces for which a natural measure of geometric complexity, entropy, is small.  The first goal is to build on work of L. Wang and the PI and to better understand properties, especially topological ones, of hypersurfaces of low entropy. This requires the investigation of the structure of non-compact self-similar (both shrinking and expanding) solutions to the mean curvature flow. The overarching objective is to see if hypersurfaces of low entropy in Euclidean four-space must be smoothly deformable to the unit sphere.  This question is closely related to the smooth 4D Schoenflies conjecture -- an important open problem in low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These equations are the prototype for an important family of geometric partial differential equations that will be investigated under this grant,  in the ""Riemannian"" setting where there is no difference between space and time. A principal objective of the funded research will be to determine precisely which 4-dimensional spaces carry solutions of these equations. Progress in this area  could  have significant repercussions outside of pure mathematics, especially because many of the  geometrical questions to be investigated  are intrinsically linked to problems in classical and  quantum gravity, as well to other areas of theoretical physics.

Topics to be investigated include Einstein metrics, the Einstein-Maxwell equations,  ALE  manifolds, scalar-flat Kaehler metrics, Bach-flat 4-manifolds, Poincare-Einstein metrics,  and various twistor constructions. The main goal is to discover and elucidate  fundamental  links  between curvature  and topology, especially in dimension four.

These methods, in addition to their intrinsic interest, provide new connections between discrete and continuous mathematics, as well as between theoretical and applied questions.<br/>This expands the range of tools available in all these areas, and facilitates more substantial interactions between disparate groups of mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists. The concrete, geometric, and practical aspects of these problems also make them appealing to students and can form the basis of student research projects. For example, what is the optimal way to decompose a 2 or 3 dimensional region as a union of triangles or tetrahedra? Doing this quickly (e.g., in polynomial time)  with good control of the shapes of the mesh elements  (e.g., no angles too large or too small) is a fundamental first step in most numerical modeling methods, and a good  initial mesh leads to faster, more accurate solutions. Nevertheless, many meshing algorithms used in practice (essentially all used in  three dimensions) are based on heuristics rather than rigorously justified methods. The PI's earlier work on meshing in 2 dimensions is based on exploiting ideas from conformal geometry and dynamics, and uses the PI's  earlier work on optimal algorithms for computing conformal mappings. The PI plans  to continue his work in 2 dimensions to find the optimal meshing algorithms and to seek analogous approaches in 3 dimensions. Conformal maps send one planar region to another in a way that preserves angles. Such maps have been studied for almost two hundred years and are fundamental to many areas including complex analysis, dynamics, fluid flow and probability. The connection with probability arises most strongly through Brownian motion,  the mathematical model of continuous random motion.  Conformal maps send Brownian paths to Brownian paths, and this `conformal invariance' allows probabilistic arguments to be applied in complex analysis and allows complex analysis to be used to study Brownian motion. The  project considers  another well known, but difficult to understand, random process related to conformal maps: diffusion limited aggregation (DLA for short). In DLA  particles wander at random in space until they make contact with a fixed cluster of particles and stick to it. As time progresses the cluster grows and takes a characteristic fractal shape, at least in numerical simulations; very little is known rigorously about the geometry of the resulting random clusters. Based on numerical simulations, the project considers new conjectures on DLA that may be more tractable. The above problems seek to use classical analysis to understand problems that are discrete in nature. Another aspect of the project is to use discrete ideas to attack  problems in continuous analysis. The PI previously introduced a new method, called quasiconformal folding, for constructing holomorphic maps that that emphasizes the discrete and combinatorial structure of holomorphic function. Using this method, the PI and other investigators have constructed examples that answered a number of open problems, including several in the field of holomorphic dynamics. This is the study of stable versus chaotic behavior when a function is  iterated, e.g.,   the Julia set of a map is a fractal set where the sequence of iterates acts chaotically. Determining the possible geometries  of this set is a fundamental problem, and the PI will work on specific conjectures  the case of general holomorphic functions defined on the whole complex plane.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The project consists of problems grouped into five main categories, but all dealing with the interaction of discrete combinatorial structures (usually trees or triangulations) with continuous problems related to complex analysis and conformal geometry (Riemann surfaces, holomorphic dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, computational geometry and statistical physics). The first part deals  with conformal structures induced by trees and graphs. Grothendieck's theory of ""dessins d'enfants"" shows that a finite graph on a compact topological surface induces a conformal structure on that surface, e.g., makes it into a Riemann surface. Several problems in the  project  seek to understand this connection precisely, e.g., given a finite tree in the plane, what does the tree ""look like"" in the induced conformal structure?  A related problem is to build a Riemann surface by identifying edges of equilateral triangles. It is known that not every compact surface occurs in this way (only countably many can occur), but the PI conjectures that every non-compact surface does occur in this way (joint work with Lasse Rempe-Gillen). The second group of problems deals with transcendental dynamics, i.e., the iteration theory of non-polynomial entire functions. Quasiconformal folding is a method of building entire functions, starting from an infinite planar tree, that gives very good control of the geometry of the function and locations of its critical values. The PI seeks to apply QC folding to various problems, such as the possible Hausdorff and packing dimension of transcendental Julia sets, and the behavior of these dimensions under perturbations of the function. The third part of the  project is to expand on recent work of the PI and Claude LeBrun that constructed examples 4-manifolds where the almost-Kahler structures form a non-empty,  proper open subset in the moduli space of ant-self-dual metric; such examples were not previously known to exist. The proof works by reducing to questions about harmonic measure on certain (very complicated)  hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Can simpler 3-manifolds be used? Are the ""exotic"" examples constructed actually ""common"" in some sense? The fourth part deals with optimal meshing problems in 2 and 3 dimensions. The PI recently proved that any planar domain bounded by a PSLG (planar straight line graph) can be meshed by non-obtuse triangles (maximum angle 90 degrees)  in polynomial time, but the optimal power remains open. The proof uses  a discrete closing lemma for certain flows associated to any triangulation and  perhaps ideas from surface dynamics might help close the gap. The proof uses several estimates from planar geometry, and it would be a very interesting and important to extend the results to triangulated surfaces, a stepping stone to the  important problem of meshing 3-dimension regions by non-obtuse tetrahedra. A key idea in the planar case is to decompose the region into pieces where either Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry is used to generate a mesh.  Can a similar strategy be used in three dimensions, perhaps using the wider variety of fundamental geometries that occur in three dimensions? Finally, the PI will consider diffusion limited aggregation (DLA), a widely studied random growth model.  The basic problem is to determine the almost sure growth rate of the cluster; there is no non-trivial lower bound and no  improvement of Kesten's 1987 upper bound.  The PI plans break the growth rate problem into two sub-problems: estimating upper bounds for the number of vertices on the convex hull boundary of DLA, and turning these into non-trivial lower bounds for the growth rate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The boundary of this space is the plane together with the point at infinity. Most often the trajectory of a collection of symmetries in this space accumulates on a fractal on the plane, the study of which is related to dynamics of flows on the hyperbolic manifold, given by the quotient of the hyperbolic three space by the symmetry group. One beautiful example of such fractals is the Apollonian gasket which is constructed by a theorem proven by the ancient Greek geometer Apollonius. Fractals are abundant in nature as can be seen in the coastlines, ocean waves, Romanesco cauliflowers, etc.  A drop of oil in soy sauce creates a circle packing akin to the Apollonian gasket. This project is expected to be of value in interpreting the structure of fractals arising in nature.<br/><br/>Whereas most of hyperbolic three manifolds have infinite volume, the dynamical rigidity properties of hyperbolic manifolds have been investigated mostly for finite volume cases.

Such surfaces locally minimize area and thus are in a sense optimal and ubiquitous - in chemistry, materials science, biology and general relativity (where they model apparent horizons of black holes).   In mathematics, they have been used more recently to solve problems in Geometry and Topology, such as in the proof of the Poincare conjecture.  The PI will study the construction, properties and applications of minimal surfaces in three-dimensional spaces.  A central problem is to understand the geometry and topological type of the minimal surfaces one can obtain.  In topology, a question asked by J.W. Alexander in 1932 is to find all the ways to divide a three-dimensional space into two pieces of a simpler type.  Minimal surfaces can be used as canonical surfaces to find such splittings.  The PI will also study related problems arising from variational principles, for instance the problem of Arnold which asks to find closed orbits of a particle subject to a magnetic field.  In addition to this research, the PI will focus on teaching and training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as advancing the field by organizing seminars, conferences and writing expository materials.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>More precisely, the objectives of this project are to develop new techniques to study minimal surfaces arising from the smooth min-max theory of Simon-Smith.    When minimal surfaces are constructed from multi-parameter sweep-outs, a basic and important open problem is whether they come with integer multiplicities.  The PI will work to show that the multiplicities are generically equal to one in the smooth setting.  One goal in this direction is to prove the Lusternick-Schnirelman Conjecture that every Riemannian three-sphere contains at least four embedded minimal two-spheres.  Such work requires developing quantitative versions of topological theorems, such as Cerf's theorem.  The PI will also use minimal surfaces to continue the study of classifying Heegaard splittings of three-manifolds.  The PI will also investigate related variational problems involving mean curvature such as obtaining the existence of closed curves of constant curvature on Riemannian two-spheres, a problem originating from physics and dynamical systems.  The techniques to be employed in these projects combine ideas from low-dimensional topology, analysis, Morse theory, and minimal surface theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, it is focused on interdisciplinarity, bringing different scientific groups together whose research areas are adjacent but would benefit from closer collaborations. On the other hand, this program aims at bridging gaps between different stages of scientific development: namely undergraduate study, graduate work, and postdoctoral research. The first week is a summer school targeted at graduate students and early career researchers. This is followed by a workshop that builds on the topics covered in the prior week and features speakers from a broad set of disciplines such as mathematical physics, topology, approximation theory, analysis, and microbiology.<br/><br/><br/>Low-dimensional topology, geometry and knot theory are excellent platforms for collaboration and training: they are highly interdisciplinary, and have features that are accessible to a beginner, while at the same time connecting to the deepest and most advanced realms of mathematics, biology, and physics.

A prototypical example is the spacetime which unifies the three dimensions of physical space and the one dimension of time into a four-dimensional system such that where and when events occur can be studied in clean and effective framework of mathematics. It is indicated by Einstein's general relativity theory that, as a source of gravitation, the spacetime is not flat. How the spacetime is curved can be precisely determined by a system of curvature equations, namely, the Einstein equations. Broadly speaking, this project centers on the relationship between the curvature of a space and the geometry on it. The latter, geometry in our context, consists of both local and global aspects. The local geometry refers to the concrete and rigid shape of a space at small scales, while the global geometry or topology focuses on the profiles at large scales which are invariant under continuous transformations. It is a fundamental principle that geometric complications of a space always correspond to the analytic singularity behaviors of the solution to the Einstein equation. The central part of this project is dedicated to the development of new tools and techniques in understanding the Einstein equation, which reflects substantially new geometric structures of the underlying space. In addition to pursuing open and fundamental problems at the forefront in differential geometry, this project also contributes to establishing correspondence between the new developed geometric structures and the conjectural principles in physical disciplines such as quantum field theory and string theory. <br/><br/>This project is concerned with a family of Einstein manifolds collapsing to a lower dimensional metric space. Together with Aaron Naber, the PI obtained a new flavor of regularity and structure theorem for collapsing Einstein spaces. The PI will continue this project to explore the structure of the singular sets and classifying bubbles for collapsing spaces. Besides studying general collapsing theory, joint with Song Sun, the PI will construct a large variety of new collapsed Einstein spaces in any dimension, which will predict new phenomena especially for higher dimensional geometries. In higher dimensions, the wild geometric nature of the limiting singular set and the lack of effective regularity theory would constitute essential difficulties in analysis and in the construction procedure. The new tools and techniques in the construction are expected more interesting than the problem itself, which will generate many problems and new directions to study. In another line of investigation, the PI will address issues involving collapsing Einstein 4-manifolds with Kaehler structures. Joint with Gao Chen and Jeff Viaclovsky, the PI will address issues involving elliptic K3 surfaces. The first part of this direction would study the metric characterizations of K3 surfaces with generic elliptic fibrations. Specifically, the PI and his collaborators will geometrically identify the bubbles and quantitatively describe the metric behaviors in each class of elliptic K3 surfaces, which would essentially connect the geometric collapsing and algebraic degeneration in an effective way. In the second part, with Hans-Joachim Hein, Song Sun and Jeff Viaclovsky, the PI have managed to construct a family of collapsed Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces which collapse to a closed interval, which in effect gives a metric-geometric description for the Type II complex structures degeneration of polarized K3 surfaces in algebraic geometry. Based on the new metric constructions, the PI and his collaborators will continue this program with a specific goal to understand the boundary structure of the moduli space of the K3 surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Midwest Geometry Conference series began in 1991. Each conference is devoted to several topics in the broad area of geometry, which is the mathematical study of shapes and their relative properties. The main goal of this series is to create a focused environment in which graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, and faculty in the Midwest can benefit from a lively exchange of ideas and from contact with leading geometers and topologists outside the region. The conference will have a mix of longer presentations by experts and shorter presentations by graduate students, with plenty of time for discussion between the talks. In addition, the organizers of the conference are deeply committed to fostering a more inclusive community in mathematics and have made it a goal to ensure the participation of women, underrepresented and minorities groups at all levels (participants, speakers, and organizers). <br/><br/>In these conferences, the term geometry is interpreted broadly and includes Riemannian geometry, relativity theory, differential topology, gauge theory, geometric partial differential equations, free boundary problems, phase transitions, nonlocal minimal surfaces and related fields. The subject has many applications in general relativity, image processing, computer science, biology and climatology, for example. Because of the broad variety of topics, each conference will focus on a different aspect and the organizers will spend time at the conference to finalize plans for the next conference, as well as managing the overall series. The structure of the rather large organizing committee allows senior faculty with considerable experience planning conferences to help junior faculty with less experience. The overall expectation is that the Midwest Geometry Conference will be a welcoming setting in which to discuss ideas, share advances in theory and applications, build a strong research network, and start new collaborations and mentoring projects.

One of the central notions of  the research is amenability, which relates to an averaging operation that is invariant under translation by group elements. It naturally appears in many fields of mathematics: operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, harmonic analysis. Amenability has many  applications and considerable effort has been given throughout the years to showing that various  groups are amenable.  <br/> <br/>The PI will study a newly developed property of group actions: Liouville property.  The property can be used to prove non-amenability due to the fact that if a group admits a non-Liouville action, then the group is not amenable. The PI have already developed tools for verifying Liouville property for graphs of the actions. These tools brought a connection of Liouville property of actions for strongly transitive groups and additive combinatorics. The project describes several questions on Liouville actions with streamlined approaches, as well as more ambitious problems and conjectures. In particular, the PI outlines an approach to non-amenability of Thompson group F, which is a widely open problem in the group theory. The PI provides an approach to amenability of interval exchange transformation groups.  The actions of these are Liouville, moreover, they are completely Liouville. Thus, amenability of these groups can not be approached using Liouville property. For this reason, the PI will study a property of random walk of action: growth of inverted orbits. Using this property there is a potential to determine amenability of the interval exchange transformation group. On the other hand the study of this property property leads to a more general theory that is planned to be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This simultaneous treatment of space coordinates and other pointwise parameters is both essential and ubiquitous in modern science, from spacetimes in Einstein's theory of General Relativity and D-branes in Particle Physics, to mathematical models used in medical imaging and diagnosis, industrial robotics, urban traffic flows, financial markets, and wireless communications, among many others. The main goal of this project is to advance the geometric understanding of four-dimensional objects as abstract mathematical entities, an approach that is general enough to allow applications to any field that makes use of four-dimensional models. In particular, this project will analyze how rigid or malleable certain four-dimensional shapes are, how that changes under certain natural curvature assumptions, and how to efficiently detect these curvature properties. A defining characteristic of the research to be conducted is the use of cutting-edge techniques recently developed in areas of mathematics not traditionally associated with geometry, bringing new perspectives to a classical subject, in a disruptive attempt to solve some of its most important open questions. This project will also partially support the CUNY Geometric Analysis seminar, and its educational mission in the CUNY graduate program, through the communication of latest research advances in the field; as well as several public outreach activities at CUNY Lehman College, a Hispanic Serving Institution in the Bronx borough of New York City.<br/> <br/>In more technical terms, this project will pursue various applications of the emerging fields of Convex Algebraic Geometry and Semidefinite Programming to Geometric Analysis and Riemannian Geometry, for instance through the study of semialgebraic sets of curvature operators of four-manifolds with sectional curvature bounds as spectrahedral shadows and limits of spectrahedra. This real algebro-geometric viewpoint on curvature operators of four-manifolds is expected to have several global consequences in the form of explicit algebraic (polynomial) characterizations of sectional curvature bounds, rank rigidity results, and optimization of curvature estimates. Furthermore, the project seeks to detect new topological obstructions to positive curvature in four-manifolds using the aforementioned techniques and trisections of their fundamental groups.

In symplectic geometry -- the geometry of phase spaces of classical mechanics -- points are ""too small"" to be relevant, and it is more natural to consider a class of half-dimensional subspaces called Lagrangian submanifolds. Considering the geometry of these submanifolds, rather than points, naturally gives rise to a noncommutative space: the Fukaya category. A remarkable mathematical conjecture inspired by ideas from theoretical physics, ""homological mirror symmetry,"" asserts that many Fukaya categories are in fact equivalent to conventional commutative spaces such as those studied in algebraic geometry. The main goal of this research project is to expand the range of settings to which mirror symmetry is applicable. <br/><br/>Specifically, the goal is to establish homological mirror symmetry in a broad enough setting to exhibit all (commutative) algebraic spaces defined by systems of polynomial equations as instances of Fukaya categories. A key step in this program is to study the non-commutative geometry that arises from a symplectic manifold equipped with one or more (commuting) functions.  More specifically, the main goal of this project is to prove Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture for all complete intersections in (possibly noncompact) toric varieties. The mirror spaces in this setting are so-called toric Landau-Ginzburg models (i.e., noncompact toric Calabi-Yau varieties equipped with regular functions). A key ingredient in the study of their Fukaya categories is the concept of simultaneous admissibility with respect to a collection of toric monomials. This gives a new approach to the Floer-theoretic calculations needed to prove homological mirror symmetry. The expected outcome will be a framework for understanding mirror symmetry that places varieties of general type (including noncompact ones) on the same footing as the more classical Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. This project will also investigate some apparently new structural features of Fukaya categories for Landau-Ginzburg models and for affine varieties, which suggest previously unnoticed functoriality properties of homological mirror symmetry, as well as a new approach to computations for affine varieties."

Through newly discovered, deep connections between various active areas of research in Geometry, including Arithmetic, Algebraic and Complex Differential Geometry, each subject has witnessed unexpected and groundbreaking advances. The conference aims to facilitate interactions among researchers in these diverse fields to further these developments. Such activities have proved to be of unparalleled importance for geometers in these interconnected areas, specially for those in early stages of their careers.<br/><br/><br/>The event supported by this award is composed of a master class (1 week long) and 4 international conferences, each one week long: Singular Metrics in Kaehler Geometry (week 2), Birational Geometry and Hodge Theory (week 3), Entire Curves, Rational Curves and Foliations (week 4), and Ball Quotient Surfaces and Lattices (week 5). The last couple of years have been witness to important progress in our understanding of the geometry of complex algebraic varieties, and more generally Kaehler varieties. The aim of this conference is to facilitate the gathering of experts of international stature in various active areas of research. The aim of the Master Class is  the introduction of techniques and theories that will be used throughout the conference. This will mainly consist of three courses: Hodge theory, K3 surfaces and special metrics on manifolds. During the second week, the goal is to study various geometric problems where the theory of singular metrics play an important role. This includes the following topics: Singular Kaehler-Einstein varieties and their moduli, Positivity in Complex Geometry and Generalized Yau-Tian-Donaldson Conjecture. The aim of the third week is to investigate various methods in Algebraic Geometry with a view towards applications in Birational Geometry and Moduli spaces. The following  topics will be of particular importance: Hodge theory and Moduli of higher dimensional varieties. The goal of the fourth week is to gather specialists in different fields working on the geometry of algebraic and transcendental curves in complex varieties. Topics include: jet spaces and foliations, Special Varieties and Nevanlinna theory. Despite an intensive search for finding a geometric construction for ball quotient surfaces, very few examples have been obtained with explicit equations. Recently Cartwright and Steger have introduced new algorithms for such constructions, leading to the completion of the classification of fake projective planes.

For instance, consider the motion of the Earth, the Moon, and a satellite, under the influence of gravity. The state of this system can be described by the positions and momenta of the three bodies, and the collection of all possible states is an example of a symplectic manifold. Physical laws, such as the conservation of energy and of momentum, restrict how this system can evolve. The goal of this project is to understand relationships between different symplectic manifolds, and specifically to understand how the restrictions on trajectories, such as those arising from conservation laws, can be translated from one symplectic manifold to another. While progress has been made toward this goal, the PI has proposed the first comprehensive approach. This project has a significant combinatorial component, which is an ideal point-of-entry for undergraduates. The PI is currently supervising an undergraduate research project, and aims to continue involving undergraduate and graduate students in his research program.<br/> <br/><br/>Specifically, the PI aims to construct a single algebraic object, the ""symplectic (A-infinity,2)-category Symp"", which binds together the Fukaya categories of symplectic manifolds into a single structure. This extends earlier work of Wehrheim-Woodward, in which those authors associate functors between Fukaya categories to Lagrangian correspondences. Besides this central component, the PI's proposed project involves three other elements. First, the PI will compute portions of Symp in some concrete situations. The PI has begun to develop techniques for computing the functors associated to Lagrangian correspondences in the context of symplectic reduction, and plans to continue these explorations. In particular, he is working with Ritter to builds on earlier work by Ritter-Smith in order to suggest a strategy for understanding how the Fukaya category changes under complex blowup. Second, the PI will explore connections to other fields. Formulating the combinatorial structures necessary for Symp led the PI to construct the 2-associahedra, which are intricate abstract polytopes which fit in well with several existing combinatorial objects. In joint work with Alexei Oblomkov, the PI is constructing complexified versions of 2-associahedra, which form a rich new family of proper log-smooth complex varieties with a close relationship to M_{0,n}-bar. Another connection is to the theory of higher categories: Symp will be an (A-infinity,2)-category, a new algebraic structure which the PI intends to show is a convenient model for certain (infinity,2)-categories. Finally, the PI aims to understand the ramifications of the symplectic (A-infinity,2)-category for symplectic cohomology, an important invariant of a noncompact symplectic manifold. Indeed, understanding the role of unit 1-morphisms in Symp should enable the PI to equip symplectic cohomology with a chain-level algebraic structure, as conjectured by Abouzaid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two key notions in differential geometry, besides ""length"" and ""angle,"" are: ""minimal surfaces,"" which generalize the concept of a straight line, and ""curvature,"" which measures how a surface is bent. The early development of differential geometry is partly attributable to physics. In the early 20th century, Einstein formulated a geometric theory of gravitation, general relativity, asserting that we live in a curved four-dimensional world (""spacetime"") where energy and mass are manifestations of the curvature of spacetime, and minimal surfaces are indicative of black hole boundaries. Nowadays, differential geometry and minimal surfaces are at the heart of several physical theories and active mathematical research directions. The principal investigator (PI) will study problems regarding minimal surfaces that are motivated by general relativity and by the van der Walls--Cahn--Hilliard theory of phase transitions for multicomponent alloy systems. This project will also support the proposer's efforts to promote student learning, inclusion, and training through summer schools, workshops, and conferences, as well as via expository articles and notes.<br/><br/>This project spans three related active research areas of minimal surface theory in differential geometry. First, the PI will investigate the construction of minimal surfaces as limiting min-max phase transitions. This construction has been recently shown to exhibit certain desirable stability properties that led to the proof of the ""multiplicity one min-max conjecture"" in three dimensions by the PI and Chodosh. The PI will continue this program, to produce surfaces with different curvatures and in different dimensions, as well as to better understand geometric implications of stable phase transitions. Second, as a step toward understanding limits of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, the PI will study smooth and non-smooth three- and four-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature via the inherent bending effects of their embedded minimal surfaces. Third, the PI will apply this study of bending effects of minimal surfaces to investigate conjectured relationships between different mass notions in general relativity, where time-symmetric initial data sets are precisely manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematics behind origami, however, is not yet fully understood. In particular, some origami models can be folded and unfolded in such a way that we could make the crease lines be hinges and the paper between them stiff like sheet metal. Such models are called rigidly flexible origami and have applications that span the physical and biological sciences, ranging from unfolding solar sails to collapsible heart stents. This project will add mathematical tools that allow industrial applications to employ cutting-edge research, from large-scale architectural structures to nano-scale robotics driven by origami mechanics. The tools from this project will help design self-foldable structures. Currently self-folding designs in engineering, architecture, and the biological sciences involve building physical models in a trial-and-error approach, wasting time and resources. The self-folding research provided by this project will allow designers to avoid pitfalls and tighten the design-to-realization process significantly. In addition to the research component, the PI shall organize a diverse range of educational activities including in-service teacher training and education, undergraduate mentoring and preparation for graduate school; high-school and undergraduate classes on the mathematics of folding; for the public, general-audience articles, lectures, and exhibitions. This will increase interest in STEM fields through the fun, hands-on nature of origami while simultaneously disseminating project results.<br/><br/>The methods of this project involve a blend of practical experimentation with theory. Programmed self-foldability of structures will be achieved by trimming away undesired paths from the configuration space of all possible rigid foldings. One approach is to transform a given rigid folding of a crease pattern into a kinematically equivalent rigid folding with fewer degrees of freedom. The PI has proposed such a transform and will develop others. Key to all of this, however, is gaining a better understanding of rigid origami configuration spaces, which are algebraically complicated and not well understood. The project seeks to understand, and exploit, local-to-global behavior that is present in many known examples of rigid origami. In these examples approximating the configuration space near the origin (the unfolded state) leads to exact equations for the global configuration space. Formulating rigid origami configuration spaces in this way will add insight into the general field of flexible polyhedral surfaces, as well as provide the data needed to prove the feasibility of origami crease pattern transforms and design reliably self-foldable origami mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A surface is a space which looks locally like the two-dimensional plane. Examples are the surface of a football or a donut. Surfaces arise naturally in the mathematical fields of topology, complex analysis, and dynamics. Classical Teichmuller theory is an area of mathematics that studies the space of all geometric shapes on a fixed surface. It also interacts with other scientific fields, e.g. through its connections with string theory in theoretical physics. The PI's research lies in two types of generalizations of Teichmuller theory. Three-dimensional generalizations of surfaces are called three-manifolds, and these are locally like the three-dimensional space we live in. The PI will continue a long-term project to classify and understand possible shapes of three-dimensional manifolds. In Higher Teichmuller Theory, the PI will study deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces with an emphasis on understanding the metrics, or distance functions, on these spaces. The PI will also contribute to the mathematical community through involvement in the Inquiry Based Learning Center at the University of Michigan, curriculum development for undergraduate courses, serving as editor of mathematical journals, organizing conferences, and mentoring undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors.<br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies geometric representations of hyperbolic groups into semi-simple Lie groups, usually of rank at least two. It is guided by inspiration from Teichmuller theory and the overall goal is to create a general theory with some of the beauty and depth of classical Teichmuller theory.  The PI will use dynamical and geometric tools to study pressure metrics on Hitchin components. In particular, the PI will investigate an analogy between augmented Teichmuller space and an augmented Hitchin component introduced by Loftin. The PI will also study deformation spaces of finite area projective surfaces, Liouville currents associated to Hitchin representations, the class of groups which admit Anosov representations of specified type and the structure of spaces of Anosov representations. In the field of Kleinian groups, the PI will use tools developed in the proof of the Ending Lamination Conjecture to build combinatorial model manifolds for hyperbolic three-manifolds with freely indecomposable fundamental group. This project is expected to yield a finer understanding of Thurston's skinning map and to allow the PI and his co-authors to establish an iterated bounded image theorem, which was used by Thurston in the original proof of the Geometrization Theorem for Haken 3-manifolds, but whose proof remains elusive. The PI will also use dynamical tools to study deformation spaces of geometrically finite groups, with the goal of proving analyticity of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and producing pressure metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has also proved useful to certain applied fields such as robotics. Moduli are parameters describing the variation in a particular geometric or algebraic structure. The construction of a moduli space brings with it a deeper understanding of which geometric structures behave well in families, and the geometric analysis of the moduli space itself reveals invariant properties of the objects they parametrize. The current project seeks to extend the PI's previous work on certain moduli spaces that arise naturally from the gauge theory of elementary particles. The Yang-Mills equations, for example, are a major point of intersection between mathematics and theoretical physics. Moduli spaces of Higgs bundles have been used to study the space of representations of surface groups into complex Lie groups and their noncompact real forms. They appear in supersymmetric gauge theories and are also important in the Geometric Langlands problem. The research projects covered by this award will further our understanding of the relationship between the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties of moduli spaces. The award also supports graduate students. <br/><br/>The specific goals lie in three areas of complex geometry related to holomorphic bundles, gauge theory, and moduli problems. The first continues work of the PI on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on Riemann surfaces. A special focus is given to understanding the asymptotic structure of the moduli space and its topological properties. This is related to important conjectures concerning the geometry of the Hitchin moduli space, in part arising from supersymmetric gauge theories. The PI will generalize previous results about the pressure metric on Hitchin components away from the Fuchsian locus. He will also explore implications for mirror symmetry calculations related to new properties of the Morse stratification of the Higgs and de Rham moduli spaces that follow from his recent work. The second project continues work on Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections on higher dimensional manifolds. One goal is to obtain a better understanding of natural gauge theoretic compactifications. The PI also seeks to extend results for projective manifolds to the Kaehler case. A related problem will study wall-crossing properties of solutions to generalized Yang-Mills equations. The third project builds on the PIs previous investigation of holomorphic extensions of analytic torsion via the approach of Deligne pairings.This will have implications for complex Chern-Simons theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These objects also have interesting applications in physics as they can be viewed as solitons in gauge theory, and are related to Higgs bundles and magnetic vortices. Such metrics solve partial differential equations, called curvature equations, where singularities can be viewed as boundary data. Recently there have been many developments in the interplay of analysis and geometry in this field, featuring new and surprising phenomena such as stratification and bubbling. The goal of the project is to develop new techniques that will help discover new features of such objects, and give insight into problems related to singular metrics, including singular uniformization, moduli spaces, and solutions of partial differential equations on manifolds with singular geometry. <br/><br/><br/>This project involves studying singular metrics using geometric microlocal analysis. The central idea is to introduce new objects, called compactifications or resolutions, to resolve the singularities. These resolutions will in turn suggest which analytic techniques need to be developed.

These are anomalies in the behavior of a physical quantity where the mathematical expressions that are used to measure such quantities break down. It may be related to the understanding of black holes or turbulence to the accumulation of cancer cells. These physical phenomena are often described via a differential equation which involves time and space.  Studying the qualitative behavior of the solutions of such equations often results in a better understanding of the related physical problem. To capture a singularity one uses a blow up procedure which allows one to focus near the potential singularity and use the scaling properties of the differential equation involved.  Because of the change in the scaling of space and time, the new solution after the blow up is defined for all space and time -- in other words it is a ""global solution"".  The classification of such solutions, when possible, sheds new insight into the singularity analysis and the related physical problem.<br/><br/>This project addresses the questions of existence, uniqueness and qualitative behavior of global solutions to nonlinear geometric elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Emphasis is given to the classification of ancient solutions and the study of singularities. The interplay between analytical and geometric techniques will be crucial for the resolution of the proposed research activities. The project links a wide range of active fields of mathematics, in particular nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry and classical analysis. The PI intends to study the applications of the mathematical problems to other disciplines such as quantum field theory and image processing.

An increasing interest has been devoted to the corresponding geometric variational problems in mathematics. Minimizing the area functional, the simplest anisotropic energy, is one of the most famous examples in this class of problems. It dates back to the work of Lagrange in 1760 and has had a major impact both in physics and in mathematics. Jesse Douglas was awarded the first Fields Medal in 1936 for his results on this topic; yet, a variety of basic questions remain open, especially in the more general anisotropic setting. The goal of this project is to develop new theories and techniques to improve the state of the art of anisotropic geometric variational problems.<br/> <br/>This project aims to increase our understanding of critical points for general elliptic integrands. In contrast to the reach theory of minimal surfaces, i.e., critical points of the area functional, very little is understood in the anisotropic framework. One of the main themes of this project is the existence of anisotropic minimal hypersurfaces in closed Riemannian manifolds. This is a fascinating and central question in geometric analysis, which has been answered for the area functional by Pitts, Schoen, Simon and Yau in the eighties. The investigator will address the more general anisotropic setting, broadening the reach of the min-max theory. This will require a refined analysis of the structure of varifolds, which will find applications also in the construction of geometric flows. Another goal of this project is to study existence and regularity results for energy minimizers of the set-theoretic Plateau problem in general metric spaces. This investigation will be then further refined for size minimizer rectifiable currents. Moreover, the investigator will study the behavior of hypersurfaces with almost constant anisotropic mean curvature.

The research goals center around a deeper understanding of shapes with uneven curvature. The distance between two points in the plane is given by the length of the segment joining them. The segment can be constructed with a ruler, however finding the distance between two points on an arbitrary geometric shape is much more difficult, partly because such shapes don't come with a ruler! Finding this ""ruler"", i.e., the best possible way to measure distances on geometric shapes, is rooted in deep problems of mathematical physics. In mathematics we measure distances using metrics. When trying to find ideal metrics, one often has to find a smooth function that solves a specific partial differential equation. This is an optimization problem with an action functional whose minimizers are exactly the solutions of the partial differential equation. It is possible to plug in non-smooth functions into the action functional, called potentials, opening the door to what is often referred to as the potential theory of the underlying equation. This project deals with problems in complex geometry where the potentials considered can be given a very specific metric geometry, leading to a much more delicate understanding than usual. In addition to the proposed research, the project will pursue a vertically integrated educational program that includes various forms of public outreach popularizing STEM fields (such as creating educational videos and posting them online), conducting undergraduate summer research and the involvement of graduate students.<br/><br/>The research goals of the project can be split in three parts.  The first part is devoted to the geometric potential theory of the geodesic rays inside the space of Kahler metrics, with a view toward various characterizations for existence of canonical Kahler metrics in complex geometry. With the metric geometry of geodesic rays sufficiently developed, one can look at these conjectures as optimization problems on the space of geodesic rays, with various refinements on the regularity of the rays considered. The second part is devoted to the  geometric potential theory of the space of singularity types, with a view toward complex Monge-Ampere equations with prescribed singularity and variation of multiplier ideal sheaves. The metric space of singularity types is expected to be complete, and it will allow for a study of singular Kahler-Einstein metrics, under variation of the singularity.

Douglas in 1932 for his advances in this field. Solutions of geometric variational problems can describe equilibrium configurations of physical systems or socio-economical models -- situations where we expect real-world systems to naturally reach a minimum-energy configuration.  As well, in the mathematical field of topology -- where objects are regarded as equivalent no matter how they are bent or stretched -- the solutions to variational problems can provide preferred representatives within such large equivalence classes. The investigation of geometric variational problems is thus of fundamental importance both in pure mathematics and in applications. This project is intended to significantly improve our knowledge on geometric variational problems by addressing a series of old and new questions, whose answer will require either the development of new techniques and ideas, or devising new approaches to known methods. This will be done through the collaborations with many leading experts in the field.<br/><br/>This project intends to put a step forward in the study of geometric variational problems by dealing with the following lines of research. Inspired by work of L. Simon, the investigator proposes to study the optimal regularity of the singular set for minimal surfaces close to special classes of minimal cones and to construct new examples of singular area minimizing hypersurfaces. In the free-boundary setting, following ideas of Caffarelli and Weiss, the investigator proposes to study the regularity of the singular set of solutions to the Alt-Caffarelli functional and the thin-obstacle problem. Finally, in a joint project with Y. Liokumovich, the investigator proposes the problem of constructing smooth minimal hypersurfaces for a generic set of metrics on a compact manifold, generalizing works of Hardt-Simon and N. Smale. These problems are of fundamental nature, as they could lead to extensions of theorems such as Colding-Minicozzi's proof of the finite time extinction of the Ricci flow, Marques-Neves' proof of Willmore's conjecture, or Schoen-Yau's proof of the positive mass theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Supersymmetry results in certain cohomological constraints.  The partial differential equations which can implement these constraints are of considerable interest in their own right from the point of view of analysis.  They pose many new challenges which should be very valuable for the future development of the theory.  It has not been uncommon in the past for the same partial differential equation, if it is highly constrained by either geometry or physics, to emerge from very different applications of mathematics.  We can expect the same from these new equations, and progress on them to be of wide value.  The research project also brings together ideas and techniques from several areas of mathematics and physics, and it should provide an excellent training ground for students and young postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>More specifically, the cohomological constraints arising from supersymmetry are generalizations of, but may be markedly different from, the Kahler condition of Hermitian metrics. As such, they lead on one side to non-Kahler geometry, and on the other side, to partial differential equations which can be much more complicated than the complex Monge-Ampere equation or the Kahler-Ricci flow.  New difficulties arise from the facts that the equations are systems, or they may involve higher powers of the curvature tensor, or the dependence of their long-time behavior on the initial data may be more delicate.  A major goal of this project is to develop a general theory for such equations, beginning with Anomaly flows. These are flows introduced by the PI and collaborators with the precise goal of implementing cohomological constraints, and which have shown their power in providing new proofs of fundamental results in Kahler geometry such as the Fu-Yau theorem and Yau's solution of the Calabi conjecture.  Another goal is the development of a hybrid cohomology which can help extract holomorphic scattering amplitudes from non-holomorphic projections from supermoduli space to moduli space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classical examples of minimal surfaces can be obtained physically by immersing a wire frame into a soap solution and forming a soap film surface whose boundary is the wire frame.  The theme of minimization permeates all of the natural sciences and minimal surfaces are thus an important model for several phenomena in nature. They have been linked to molecular engineering, materials science, and to the theory of black holes in general relativity.  The proposed research aims to understand how such surfaces can be locally minimizing but not globally so and, moreover, how this can reveal the shape of the space they live in. <br/><br/>Minimal submanifolds are critical points to the most fundamental variational problem in the geometry, that of minimizing area.  They have been an essential object in mathematical research since the work of Euler and Lagrange, and many of the ideas developed in their study turned out to be key in the development of calculus of variations, nonlinear PDEs, and mathematical physics.  In addition, minimal submanifolds have also been a crucial method in understanding curvature, yielding many striking applications to geometry, low-dimensional topology, and general relativity.  Recent advances on the existence theory of minimal hypersurfaces suggest that this is a very exciting time for the field. A major component of the proposed research is to investigate new Morse index estimates in light of the new existence results.

Simple algebraic transformations already  exhibit many of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes. These universal patterns may be revealed through the rigorous study of  moduli spaces, their compactifications and their stratifications  by dynamical invariants.  This project appeals to a broad range of mathematical disciplines to both deepen our understanding of dynamical systems and to sharpen our mathematical and computational methods.  Its methods have already led to the discover of new and unexpected algebraic regimes, through a combination of theoretical tools that narrow the domain of search, and experimental methods such as the simulation of bouncing molecules in idealized chambers.<br/>A central issue in science, from biology to mathematics, is the study and classification of the wide variations that can take place in a single recognized species.   The moduli spaces  constructed by Ahlfors, Bers and Mumford in the 1960s, give this kind of classification for compact Riemann surfaces with a fixed genus g and number of marked points n. Today the study of moduli spaces is the meeting ground for disciplines ranging from arithmetic geometry to string theory. In dimension three, Riemann surfaces are replaced by hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This project aims to expand the frontiers of our understanding of both moduli spaces and hyerbolic 3-manifolds from the perspective of dynamical systems, unified by the action of SL2(R) in both regimes. It draws on methods ranging from complex analysis to low--dimensional topology and renormalization. The concerted study of specific examples, assisted by computer visualization and algebraic manipulation, also plays  a central role of in this research.<br/><br/><br/>The PI and his coworkers have recently discovered new totally geodesic curves and surfaces in the moduli spaces for (g,n) = (4,0), (1,3), (1,4) and (2,1). Their methods also reproduce most previously known examples of these rare and beautiful objects.  A central goal of this project is to put forth a unified construction of all known examples, and investigate the prospects for obtaining a complete classification. The project will also address problems concerning totally geodesic planes in open hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the complexity of closed loops on surfaces, the arithmetic underlying billiards in polygons, moduli spaces of rational maps, and connection between twisted 1-forms and 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. The training of graduate students to become active and independent researchers forms a central part of this project. The field of complex dynamics and moduli spaces is one where concrete  problems and examples abound, and yet some of the deepest insights and methods of modern mathematics can be brought to bear. It invites the participation of experts from a broad range of fields.

One of them is the in-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic curves - in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi, Riemann, Klein and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual landscaping of mathematical physics dictated by the progress of classical and quantum mechanics, and often associated with the names of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare, Hilbert, Einstein and Weyl. It is string theory that in the search for the ultimate laws of nature places algebraic curves at the center of modern fundamental physics, generating new mathematical questions and pointing out plausible answers with an amazing pace and persistence. Some of the problems we work on are motivated by such questions, some others hopefully provide answers that string theorist did not really anticipate. The award will be used to support at least three PhD students. The PI's work will also influence the climate in STEM education through his involvement with K-12 and higher level educational projects, such as Math Olympiads, math circles, book publishing, and expository writing.  <br/><br/>The specific goals of the project build upon the success of the theory of the so-called K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants, developed by the PI among other researchers, and studying topological invariants of phase manifolds of Hamiltonian systems based on properties of vector bundles over moduli spaces of holomorphic curves in these manifolds. From a formal homotopy theory viewpoint, K-theoretic invariants, as well as their cohomological predecessors, should be specializations of much more general cobordism-valued invariants. An approach, referred here as ""formal"", disregards the subtle stacky or orbifold properties of the moduli spaces, and should be contrasted with the ""genuine"" theory fully capturing these subtleties.  In this project, the PI and his collaborators will move beyond cohomological and K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants, and explore the possibility of defining and computing genuine, as opposed to formal, Gromov-Witten invariants with values in complex cobordisms. One direction is to include quantum ""chi-y""-theory (based on the Hirzebruch genus), with expected connections with, and applications to representation theory and quiver varieties.  Another direction is to explore the specialization to the theory (where y=-1) based on the topological Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of stable maps. Yet another one is to examine the prospects of Gromov-Witten theory based on elliptic cohomology.

Not only is the theory of geometric flows a fundamental subject in mathematics, but it also has potential applications to other scientific fields including computer sciences, material sciences and physics. One of the most important problems in the study of geometric flows is to understand all possible singularities of the flows, which are in turn modeled by self-similar solutions of the flows. The proposed research on the moduli space of such self-similar solutions is expected to broaden and advance the knowledge and techniques both within and outside of mathematics, such as the topology of manifolds, image processing, crystal growths and the large-scale structure of the universe.

First, the PI, in the continuing collaboration with Brett Kotschwar at the Arizona State University, will apply the Carleman type technique to attack the rigidity problem for noncompact gradient Ricci solitons. Second, appealing to the tools inspired in part by the theory of minimal surfaces, the PI aims to describe a much detailed picture of two-dimensional smooth noncompact self-shrinkers of finite genus of mean curvature flow. To achieve this, the PI will begin with investigating the asymptotic structures at infinity of such self-shrinkers which are conjectured to be regular cones or cylinders. Then the PI intends to address the Cylinder Rigidity Conjecture of Ilmanen concerning the uniqueness of self-shrinking cylinders. At the end, the PI, with Joel Spruck at the Johns Hopkins University, plans to seek the sufficient and necessary conditions of the existence of the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for the self-shrinker equation. Third, in higher dimensions, the PI, joint with Neshan Wickramasekera at the University of Cambridge, will extend the regularity theory of stable minimal submanifolds to derive estimates on the size of singular sets of entropy stable weak self-shrinkers."

In the past decades there has been a large trend toward studying symplectic manifolds using a tool called Fukaya categories, which measures the geometry and packages the information into algebraic data which can be quantified and understood more readily than the geometry itself. This project aims to study the extent to which the Fukaya category is complete as a measurement, or loses information. The research will focus on a particularly well-understood case, that of flexible manifolds. The tools the PI proposes for studying this question come from a number of recent discoveries in the field. Results from this project will be particularly useful for bridging the gaps in our our understanding between the geometry of symplectic manifolds, and their Fukaya categories.<br/><br/><br/>Some of the tools the PI intends to use come from constructable sheaf theory, partially wrapped Fukaya categories, arboreal singularities, and loose Legendrians. A naive conjecture is that, if the wrapped Fukaya category of a Weinstein manifold is trivial, then the manifold is flexible. Though this is known to be false (due to the existence of subflexible manifolds), related statements are known to be true by strengthening the hypotheses. A major bridge the PI proposes is the use of arboreal singularities, where flexibility is comparatively easy to detect. Additionally arboreal singularities have the advantage that the Fukaya category can be expressed with finite combinatorial methods, here using isomorphisms between Floer homology and microlocal sheaf theory. Various special cases, such as the case of contractible 6-manifolds, would yield strong results and are potentially easier to approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a central field in mathematics, which has ramifications and connections in physics and other sciences. One of the main themes of this research is the study of a class of spaces, known as Calabi-Yau, which play an important role in mathematics as well as high energy theoretical physics. According to string theory, our four-dimensional physical space-time possesses six extra dimensions which are extremely small, so that we don't normally perceive them, but are crucial for understanding elementary particles. These six dimensions together form a tiny Calabi-Yau space, which captures essential features of particle physics. Understanding its geometry would allow us to understand how particles are created and how they interact, and is one of the main current problems in mathematical physics. <br/><br/><br/>The PI will use techniques from geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations to investigate problems about the geometry of complex and symplectic manifolds. The first project is about understanding limits of Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds as the Kahler class degenerates. This is closely related to the theory of mirror symmetry, which was inspired by physical considerations. The second project concerns the long-time behavior of the Ricci flow on compact Kahler manifolds, in the most difficult case when collapsing occurs at infinite time. The Ricci flow was used spectacularly to prove the Poincare and Geometrization conjectures for 3-manifolds, and understanding its behavior on higher-dimensional manifolds is a central problem in the field. The third project is centered on Donaldson's program to extend Yau's solution of the Calabi Conjecture in Kahler geometry to symplectic four-manifolds. This would provide a new analytic tool to construct symplectic forms four-manifolds as solutions of a highly nonlinear PDE, and would have striking applications in symplectic topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study of curvature is important in all domains of science and engineering. For example, the theory of general relativity posits that gravity curves space and time in a mathematically precise manner, while in materials science, the meeting points between crystal structures are modeled by (a rather different notion of) curvature. This project is concerned with the study of a particular measure of bending called scalar curvature. Scalar curvature is one of the simplest measures of bending, but due to this simplicity scalar curvature can contain only a limited amount of information. Hence, we must study scalar curvature through highly indirect means. One way to explore scalar curvature is in relation to the isoperimetric problem: in a given space, how can we enclose the largest amount of volume with the smallest perimeter? This is one of the oldest mathematical questions, but its link to scalar curvature is only recently beginning to be understood. The PI's project will continue the study of scalar curvature as it affects the large-scale behavior of area and volume, with particular emphasis on the relationship between such topics and problems related to general relativity. In addition to this research, this project will also support the PI's continued efforts to promote student learning and training through seminar organization, conferences, and summer schools, as well as expository articles and notes.  <br/><br/>A major component of the research plan is the continued study of the link between large-scale variational problems and scalar curvature, motivated by geometric and physical considerations such as the Penrose inequality and static uniqueness questions from general relativity. To this end, the PI plans to continue his investigation of global uniqueness questions related to scalar curvature and the isoperimetric problem. Recently, several such problems have been understood in three dimensions, using a combination of powerful tools from geometric analysis (many of which are limited to three dimensions). One portion of the research will consist of investigating higher dimensional analogues of these results, which will necessitate the development of a wide array of new techniques. The ideas developed in these aforementioned global uniqueness works have also led to other (a priori unrelated) topics that the PI will investigate. For example, determining the validity of the Minkowski inequality for non-convex surfaces (possibly with an additional bending term) is related to the uniqueness question for large stable constant mean curvature surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds. Similarly, an invariant related to the least area in the homology class of a torus for certain Riemannian three-manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature is related to the rigidity of area-minimizing cylinders in three-manifolds of non-negative scalar curvature. In a different (but related) direction, this project will also include investigation of the relationship between the geometry and topology of minimal surfaces, including the study of surfaces with simple topology or small index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ricci flows have become the subject of intensive study, as they have been used to prove various long-standing conjectures, such as the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures in dimension 3. The general expectation is that a Ricci flow produces a geometry in the limit that is in some sense inherent to the topology, i.e. the loose makeup, of the underlying space. However, usually a Ricci flow develops complicated singularities in finite time. In dimension 3 these singularities can be removed manually by so called surgeries and the flow can be continued beyond them. Recently, a new class of ""singular Ricci flows"" was introduced in dimension 3. These flows flow ""automatically through singularities at an infinitesimal scale"", thereby eliminating the somewhat unnatural surgery process. The goal of this project is to understand these flows further and to use this understanding to study the topology of certain spaces of metrics and diffeomorphism groups. In addition, the PI will work on Ricci flows in higher dimensions, aimed at understanding their singularity formation, which may result in a similar surgery or singular flow construction.<br/><br/><br/>The research project is split into two projects. The first project is a continuation of the PI's work (in collaboration with Bruce Kleiner) on the uniqueness and continuity of singular Ricci flows through singularities. The general goal of this project is to understand the geometric, topological and analytic applications of this work. Among other things, the PI has a strategy to resolve the Generalized Smale Conjecture, which would extend a previous partial resolution by the PI and Kleiner. Further potential applications concern the topology and geometry of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics, as well as the study of generic Ricci flows in dimension 3. The second project is a continuation of the PI's work on the study of Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature. The PI will investigate several conjectures that have been verified under the assumption of bounded scalar curvature. These conjectures are likely to remain true if this assumption is removed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surprisingly often, it is advantageous to deform the geometry of this object in order to better understand it.  That is, one may understand something geometric by understanding how one may change it.  The prototypical example of this is Riemann's moduli space of curves, which is a space each of whose points represents a two-dimensional object called a Riemann surface.  This space captures all of the ways one may deform these surfaces.  The proposed research will explore the geometry of this space, its analogs in spaces of deformations of certain three-dimensional spaces called hyperbolic manifolds, and their interrelationships. It also contains suitable sub-projects for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project falls into two parts: the deformation theory of hyperbolic three-manifolds; and the study of geometric and algebraic properties of subgroups of mapping class groups of surfaces, their associated surface bundles, and profinite completions. The first is principally concerned with understanding a certain function called the skinning map, which was discovered and studied by Thurston in his work on the geometrization of three-manifolds, and which measures the effects of deformations of hyperbolic three-manifolds.  A better understanding of this function sheds light on the geometry of three-manifolds and its relation to topology.  In particular, the PI will continue an ongoing project with collaborators Bromberg and Minsky to establish effective bounds on the diameter of this map and its relation to the notion of renormalized volume.

For instance, the work of Calabi-Yau directly provided mathematical foundation to mirror symmetry. According to A. Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of space-time. Therefore, the research in complex geometry is crucially important in physics and cosmology. This project also has impact in algebraic geometry, physics as well as partial differential equations. Progress in these problems will be highly interesting to many different fields.<br/><br/>The famous Calabi conjecture states that every Kaehler manifold whose first Chern class has a definite sign will always have a Kaehler-Einstein metric with appropriate sign on its scalar curvature. This famous conjecture was proved by Yau in 1976 with vanishing first Chern class, and independently by Yau and Aubin for the case  of negative first Chern class. For general Fano manifolds, S. T. Yau first suggested that the existence of Kaehler Einstein metric is related to certain notion of stability of the underlying polarization. This is proved by PI, S. K. Donaldson and S. Sun in 2012 via a series of three papers. The PI believe that more exciting progress will follow after these work in this area which will impact not only on the rest of mathematics but also on physics. The PI shall study a network of problems centered around the existence of constant scalar curvature metrics and other related areas. Here constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics includes the more famous Kaehler-Einstein metric as a special case. So it is a natural extension of the original Calabi conjecture. In 2018, the PI and Cheng Jingrui made major progress on this problem by establishing important a priori estimate for constant scalar Kaehler metrics.  The PI shall push this further towards the existence of constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics by studying a network of problems related algebraic stability to coerciveness of the appropriate variational energy functional.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary motivation for this project is to deepen our understanding of these connections. There is a special class of lattices that are called ""arithmetic"", where the connections to number theory are particularly strong, and this an overarching goal of this project is to use techniques from dynamics and geometry to understand when a lattice is arithmetic, and moreover deepen our understanding of the geometric consequences of arithmeticity. The project provides summer support for graduate students allowing them time for research and collaboration.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project aims to understand the geometry and topology of locally symmetric spaces, particularly real and complex hyperbolic manifolds, inspired by the fundamental problems in low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory that have dominated the fields since the pivotal work of Thurston and Gromov. On the one hand, it is of significant interest to learn the extent to which the Gromov-Thurston program pushes into this more general setting. More importantly, the questions studied in dimensions 2 and 3 for the last forty years are closely related to classical problems about discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and real and complex hyperbolic lattices are precisely the cases where many of the basic questions remain open, e.g., Betti numbers and problems related to (non)arithmeticity.

For instance, consider the motion of the Earth, the Moon, and a satellite, under the influence of gravity. The state of this system can be described by the positions and momenta of the three bodies, and the collection of all possible states is an example of a symplectic manifold. Physical laws, such as the conservation of energy and of momentum, restrict how this system can evolve. The goal of this project is to understand relationships between different symplectic manifolds, and specifically to understand how the restrictions on trajectories, such as those arising from conservation laws, can be translated from one symplectic manifold to another. While progress has been made toward this goal, the PI has proposed the first comprehensive approach. This project has a significant combinatorial component, which is an ideal point-of-entry for undergraduates. The PI is currently supervising an undergraduate research project, and aims to continue involving undergraduate and graduate students in his research program.<br/> <br/><br/>Specifically, the PI aims to construct a single algebraic object, the ""symplectic (A-infinity,2)-category Symp"", which binds together the Fukaya categories of symplectic manifolds into a single structure. This extends earlier work of Wehrheim-Woodward, in which those authors associate functors between Fukaya categories to Lagrangian correspondences. Besides this central component, the PI's proposed project involves three other elements. First, the PI will compute portions of Symp in some concrete situations. The PI has begun to develop techniques for computing the functors associated to Lagrangian correspondences in the context of symplectic reduction, and plans to continue these explorations. In particular, he is working with Ritter to builds on earlier work by Ritter-Smith in order to suggest a strategy for understanding how the Fukaya category changes under complex blowup. Second, the PI will explore connections to other fields. Formulating the combinatorial structures necessary for Symp led the PI to construct the 2-associahedra, which are intricate abstract polytopes which fit in well with several existing combinatorial objects. In joint work with Alexei Oblomkov, the PI is constructing complexified versions of 2-associahedra, which form a rich new family of proper log-smooth complex varieties with a close relationship to M_{0,n}-bar. Another connection is to the theory of higher categories: Symp will be an (A-infinity,2)-category, a new algebraic structure which the PI intends to show is a convenient model for certain (infinity,2)-categories. Finally, the PI aims to understand the ramifications of the symplectic (A-infinity,2)-category for symplectic cohomology, an important invariant of a noncompact symplectic manifold. Indeed, understanding the role of unit 1-morphisms in Symp should enable the PI to equip symplectic cohomology with a chain-level algebraic structure, as conjectured by Abouzaid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A ""metric"" on such a space is an object that endows that space with a shape or more precisely, with Ricci curvature. The study of these metrics lies at the nexus of complex geometry and geometric analysis. This project is concerned with the construction of complete Kahler metrics with prescribed Ricci curvature on non-compact Kahler manifolds; more specifically, non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and Kahler-Ricci solitons. Applications of such manifolds permeate throughout physics and mathematics. Indeed, Calabi-Yau manifolds of complex dimension three have become prominent in string theory where they supposedly model the six additional real dimensions of space-time that we do not see, whereas Kahler-Ricci solitons provide models for the formation of singularities in an important evolution equation, namely the Kahler-Ricci flow. Efforts will be made to construct new examples of these manifolds and to formulate their existence in terms of algebraic geometric criteria. This will enhance our understanding of the geometry of non-compact Kahler manifolds and will involve applications of techniques from analysis, in particular partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the proposed research project comprises two parts. The goal of the first part is to construct more examples of non-compact complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with Euclidean volume growth and with a singular non-flat tangent cone at infinity, developing the work of Li, the PI and Rochon, and Szekelyhidi. Such manifolds have been used as building blocks for G2-manifolds and may shed light on a conjecture of Yau asserting the compactifiability of a complete Calabi-Yau manifold with finite topology. Moreover, these manifolds have applications in physics such as in the AdS/CFT correspondence and string theory. The second part of the proposal deals with studying complete non-compact gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons. The objectives of this part are threefold.<br/>(1) To glue the expanding gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons that the PI has constructed with Deruelle together on a compact Kahler manifold to construct a solution of the Kahler-Ricci flow with singular initial data. This ties in with the analytic Minimal Model Program using the Kahler-Ricci flow proposed by Song and Tian and builds on the work of Gianniotis and Schulze. <br/>(2) To construct examples of complete expanding gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons with a singular tangent cone at infinity with Euclidean volume growth of which there are currently no known examples. This builds on the work of the PI and Deruelle.<br/>(3) To study the existence and uniqueness of non-compact complete shrinking gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons for a fixed holomorphic vector field. This is a natural extension of work by the PI, Deruelle, and Sun.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems are mathematical objects which evolve in time, and they are ubiquitous in the applications of mathematics.  Whenever math is used to predict the future, e.g. to predict the weather, the stock market, or the behavior of particles in a solution, a dynamical system is involved.  The dynamical systems in the real world, like those just mentioned, are often extraordinarily complex.  The PI will study a simple class of dynamical systems modeled on ideal billiards in polygons with a view towards understanding the complicated dynamical systems that occur in applications.  The PI will work to uncover and categorize the range of dynamical behaviors possible in billiard systems, and will continue his research exploring connections between billiards and the theory of numbers.  Using the resources allotted by this grant, the PI will also create a graduate course on topics relevant to his research.  The course will culminate in a workshop hosted at Rice University during which leaders in the field have a chance to interact with students in the class.  Finally, the PI will use funding from this grant to create a curriculum in mathematical biology for the Say STEM Camp, a camp aimed at engaging high school students in groups typically underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project seeks to address fundamental challenges in the study of dynamics on Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces. These subjects have connections with many areas of mathematics and important applications to the classification of mapping classes, the dynamics of rational maps and billiards in polygons. Of particular importance are the special subvarieties of moduli space which are invariant under the geodesic flow.  Such subvarieties are rare and their origins are mysterious.  The PI will pursue two lines of research in this proposal. First, the PI will investigate connections between special subvarieties and number theory, with the particular goal of understanding the arithmetic geometry of these spaces.  Second, the PI will seek to develop a theory for higher dimensional special subvarieties with a view towards eventual classification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Einstein equations, which are the field equations of general relativity, describe how spacetime universe curves in the presence of matter; it is this curvature that is responsible for the effects of gravity. General relativity is a remarkably accurate theory, which describes the formation of black holes, predicts the existence of gravitational waves (now famously detected by LIGO), and governs the large-scale behavior of the entire cosmos.  The aim of this conference is to gather together leading experts at the intersection of mathematical general relativity and geometric analysis to discuss recent advances and new directions of research in this area, and to expose graduate students and young mathematicians to these developments.  <br/><br/><br/>Mathematical general relativity is a very rapidly developing area of research.  Geometric analysis has played a remarkable role in this development, beginning with the singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose.  Many advances have ensued in both the elliptic and hyperbolic aspects of the theory, including developments in the theory of black holes, in understanding of Penrose's cosmic censorship conjecture, and in the study of manifolds of nonnegative scalar curvature.  Geometric inequalities, such as the positive mass theorem and the Riemannian Penrose inequality, play a deep and fundamental role in general relativity.  In recent years new geometric inequalities, involving physical quantities such as mass, angular momentum, charge, etc., have given rise to many interesting open questions.  Studies of initial data sets for gravitational fields have proven to be fruitful areas of research.  The initial data for the Cauchy problem associated to the Einstein field equations are required to satisfy the so-called constraint equations, a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, the geometric origin of which are the Gauss-Codazzi equations.  Great progress has been made in developing techniques for solving the constraint equations, both by the conformal method and by gluing methods.  The development of the theory of marginally outer trapped surfaces, which are general initial data versions of minimal surfaces, has led to results concerning the topology of black holes (and the region exterior to black holes), and has made possible a direct proof of the spacetime positive mass theorem in dimensions less than eight. The recent proof of the (Riemannian) positive mass theorem (in all dimensions and without spin assumption) has greatly advanced knowledge about geometric singularities and their roles in initial data sets.  Efforts to obtain a localized measure of mass, which includes a contribution from the gravitational field, have led to various notions of quasi-local mass, and continues to be a very active area of research. Geometric flows have played a fundamental role in many of these developments. The conference will address all these topics.
