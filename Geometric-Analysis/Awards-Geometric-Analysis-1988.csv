These involve the scattering theory of                    manifolds of constant negative curvature and inverse spectral                   problems on compact Riemannian manifolds. These are geometric                   problems but the techniques to be employed will involve methods                 of mathematical physics. The first project will make use of the                 stationary scattering theory of elliptic operators invented for                 for the Schrodinger equation. The inverse spectral theory will                  employ techniques of partial differential equations.                                The first set of problems to be addressed concerns the                      spectral theory of the Laplace operator on a real hyperbolic                    manifold and its connections with the theory of discrete groups                 of hyperbolic isometries. Perry will concentrate on those                       manifolds which are quotients of hyperbolic space by a group of                 hyperbolic isometries. The work will involve investigations of                  the resolvent, eigenfunctions and scattering matrix of the                      Laplace operator on the hyperbolic space. It is hoped that this                 will be helpful in studying the Selberg trace formula and the                   Selberg zeta function of the isometry group.                                        He will also continue his study of isospectral metrics on a                 Riemannian manifold. By restricting attention to metrics in a                   conformal class, Perry, in joint work with Brooks and Yang has,                 extended some two-dimensional results to the three- and four-                   dimensional case. Attempts will be made to remove the restriction               to conformal classes and to find higher dimensional results."

This is an area which is currently                      experiencing dramatic developments. Pitts will focus his                        attention primarily on minimal surfaces in three dimensional                    manifolds rather than Euclidean space. The computational aspects                of this research provide a new direction for Pitts' research.                   This is an exciting development which is very much in line with                 contemporary work of other researchers.                                              The study of minimal surfaces in three dimensional manifolds               is an important aspect of Thurston's geometrization conjecture.                 Here the investigations will concern the possibility of                         constructing metrics which admit infinitely many minimal spheres                and tori. Another part of the project will be aimed at finding                  conditions on a noncompact hyperbolic manifold which guarantee                  that it supports a compact minimal surface. Pitts is also                       developing numerical methods for approximating minimal surfaces.                He will implement these algorithms in software and produce                      graphics of the stereographic images of the surfaces. The ability               to visualize these surfaces is rapidly becoming an essential                    ingredient of current research into these variational problems."

Historically                most research was directed at surfaces of zero mean curvature,                  these are known as minimal surfaces. Prototypical examples being                soap films. During the last five years there has been a great                   deal of activity in the realm of non-zero mean curvature; here                  soap bubbles are the typical examples. This work received its                   impetus from Wente's counterexample to the Hopf conjecture.                     During the last year Kapouleas has shown how to construct many                  more such examples of different topological types. Korevaar's                   work is in many ways complementary to this and a natural                        development in the sense that he is looking at the structure that               such surfaces must have rather than attempting to construct more                examples.                                                                            Korevaar's earlier work with his collaborators has led to a                good understanding of the behaviour of these surfaces near to                   infinity. His attention will now turn to an investigation of the                structure in bounded regions of space. This will involve an                     interaction of ideas from geometry and the theory of partial                    differential equations. He will also carry out related research                 into capillarity questions and into convexity theorems for                      solutions of elliptic equations."

Stone's research concerns the general problem of extracting                global topological information about a space from local geometric               data. In classical differential geometry the data are presented                 in infinitesimal form, and the Chern-Weil theory constructs from                them further infinitesimals which, when integrated, yield the                   desired characteristic classes. Stone will develop a systematic                 analogue of the entire Chern-Weil theory that does not use                      infinitesimals but employs techniques of algebraic topology.

The techniques to be used come from a                    branch of the calculus of variations, geometric measure theory,                 which is having an ever increasing impact on many areas of                      geometric analysis. This work has applications in materials                     research and some joint projects with John Cahn, a metallurgist,                will be continued. One of her main objectives will be to                        understand the geometric consequences of minimization of crystal-               type anisotropic surface energies. In a slightly different                      direction she will try to develop and employ combinatorial                      techniques of area minimization. These latter techniques become                 appropriate in the polyhedral situations which frequently arise.                     The energy functionals have an integral representation                     inwhich the integrand, known as the free energy, is defined on                  the unit sphere. The free energy in turn gives rise to the Wulff                shape, which is the obect of most of Taylor's studies. She will                 study several new types of singularities in these surfaces and                  some new rules for orientations in heterogeneous nucleation,                    which have been predicted in some of her earlier work with Cahn.                Some of this will involve allowing edge energies in the integral                being minimized. Other investigations will study the evolution of               the minimizing surfaces as the energy function is allowed to                    vary."

The first is the study of constant mean               curvature surfaces. Most work here has been done on minimal                     surfaces, the case of zero curvature. In recent years the work of               Wente has stimulated interest in the case of non-zero curvature.                This arose from Wente's construction of a counterexample to                     Hopf's long standing conjecture that all soap bubbles are                       spheres. It is now becoming clear that there is a rich theory of                these surfaces analogous but different from that of minimal                     surfaces. The second area involves the study of isoparametric                   surfaces. These have the property that the distinct principal                   curvatures at each point are the same. Interest in such surfaces                stems from the fact that they behave in a fashion very similar to               the homogeneous spaces. Solomon will focus his attention on the                 spectral theory of isoparametric minimal surfaces in spheres.                        The first topic will involve an investigation of the moduli                space of complete constant mean curvature surfaces. The intention               here is to compare and contrast this theory with that of minimal                surfaces. The study of spectral properties of isoparametric                     surfaces is important since they are in many ways the natural                   successors to the symmetric spaces and they provide the only                    other setting in which the spectrum of the Laplace operator is                  known. The eigenvalues are in fact integers and so it is natural                to investigate the geometric consequences of such an observation.               The key to the study of these surfaces is the fact that they                    decompose into mutually orthogonal geodesic foliations by                       subspheres of the ambient sphere."

Soap films                 are the prototypical examples of such surfaces. Much current work               is directed towards the study of their singularities.                           Singularities occur at points where there is no well defined                    tangent plane. Work of Almgren has established upper bounds on                  the sizes of the singularity sets, but so far little is known                   about their structure. In particular they may even turn out to                  have fractional dimension.

In addition he will use                   calibrations to find further examples of area minimizing                        surfaces. These are closed differential forms which take extreme                values on the tangent spaces of such surfaces.

A very simple example of this situation is the                   group of rotations of three-dimensional space about axes passing                through the origin, acting on a sphere centered at the origin.                  In higher dimensions, the examples become more exotic, and more                 importantly, as Professor Zimmer has discovered, the rules of the               game that say what sorts of actions can occur on what sorts of                  manifolds change in striking and fundamental ways.  A whole new                 subject, which might be called nonlinear representation theory,                 is growing up to take its place next to the older and much better               understood theory of group representations on vector spaces.

The                 arithmetic nature of actions of of these groups will be                         investigated.  There will be continued study of the phenomena                   alluded to above that make the higher-dimensional case                          qualitatively different from the lower-dimensional."

The                   first concerns the spectral theory of three dimensional manifolds               and the second focusses on estimation of the topological entropy                in dynamical systems. The spectral theory of manifolds centers                  around the derivation of geometric information from knowledge of                the spectrum of the Laplacian on the manifold. This has its                     origins in questions such as ""Can you hear the shape of a drum?"",               since the spectrum of the Laplacian is closely related to the                   harmonics of the surface. Her work on entropy is part of a wide                 ranging program of many researchers to measure the chaos in a                   system.                                                                              Pignataro has already been involved in important work on the               eigenvalues of the Laplacian on hyperbolic surfaces. The results                there show that the small eigenvalues vary like the lengths of                  short separating geodesics. The more complicated the topology the               more eigenvalues that can be estimated. She will now try to                     extend some of these ideas and results to three dimensional                     manifolds. This will involve overcoming quite difficult                         topological problems. In particular the ends of these manifolds                 are more complicated than those of surfaces and have only                       recently been understood.                                                            Her work on dynamical systems involves estimation of the                   topological entropy. This essentially measures the number of                    different orbit types of a system. She will investigate the                     connections between entropy and the volume growth of certain                    embedded submanifolds."

The origins of this subject lie in the study of soap films.                     Because of the surface tension in these films they naturally form               minimal surfaces. That is, for a given boundary they have minimum               area of all surfaces with this boundary. In the mathematical                    theory this property translates into a curvature property of the                surface. Nowadays surfaces with zero mean curvature are referred                to as minimal surfaces. Chang's research is concerned with the                  existence of minimal surfaces within a given surface. This is a                 very natural and important extension since such minimal surfaces                provide a natural extension of the notion of geodesic, that is,                 minimum length path, in the surface.                                                 Chang has developed remarkable expertise in the rather                     inaccessible topic of geometric measure theory. Many of the most                exciting developments in minimal surface theory have made use of                this theory. He will build on recent work of others concerning                  integral currents and varifolds to attack these problems. The                   major focus of the work will be to study the topological type of                these minimal surfaces and the size of their set of                             singularities. Probably the most difficult hurdle to overcome                   will be to find techniques which apply to the high codimensional                situation."

Hurley's objective is to                       investigate the mathematical explanations of various recent                     empirical observations. One reason for interest in cellular                     automata is that some of them exhibit self-organizing behavior.                 In mathematical terms this suggests the existence of attractors.                     A cellular automaton can be thought of as a map on doubly                  infinite sequences which commutes with shifts. Hurley will study                the dynamics of such maps. Self-organization manifests itself in                the observation that random sequences become more highly                        patterned under repeated iterations and the asymptotic pattern is               independent of the original sequence.

Differential operators can be defined in terms of these local coordinates. Certain numbers that can be extracted from the operators tell us very interesting things about the underlying manifold. Group representation theory comes into the picture when the manifold is a symmetric space. The noncommutative perspective afforded by recent developments in the theory of operator algebras is very helpful when the manifold carries some additional structure, such as a foliation with pathological leaf space. One specific objective of the project is to apply methods of harmonic analysis on semisimple Lie groups to the study of eta invariants and analytic torsion of locally symmetric manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature, aiming to express these invariants in terms of the geodesic flow.
