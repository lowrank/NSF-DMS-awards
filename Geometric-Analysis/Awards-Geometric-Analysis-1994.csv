The analysis is based on the Wiener measure on these spaces, which plays a similar role as the Lebesgue measure in the analysis of finite dimensional manifolds. Since the Wiener measure gives rise to Brownian motion and Brownian bridge, the probabilistic methods (stochastic differential equations, diffusion theory, etc.) will be used extensively in our analysis. The geometric and analytical properties of path and loop spaces will be studied through the probabilistic properties of the so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.  The PI will discover generalizations of integration by parts formula for the gradient operator in various geometric settings (mainly for manifolds with boundary) and compute the familiar geometric objects such as torsion and curvature tensors of the path and loop spaces (as Hilbert manifolds) in terms of stochastic integrals involving the usual torsion and curvature tensors of the underlying Riemannian manifold. The long-term goal is to develop an intrinsic, geometric Malliavin calculus and to investigate hypercontractivity, logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and Meyer's equivalence in our new geometric setting and their interaction with the Riemannian structure of the base manifold.   Interdisciplinary research is the current trend of scientific research. Probability theory is a branch of mathematics which studies random behavior of collective phenomena.  In the last two decades probability theory has been applied with great success to problems from classical mathematical subjects such as partial differential equations and geometry.  This new probabilistic point of view not only stimulated research in these classical subjects but also opened new avenues of research such as stochastic differential geometry and diffusion theory. The PI will use probabilistic methods to study properties of an important class of geometric objects called loop spaces (for example,  the collection of closed paths on a sphere), which just began to gain importance in modern physics. He will show how the curvature of the base space (the sphere in the above case) affects the behavior of certain random processes associated with loop spaces and give both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the interaction between the geometry of the space and the underlying random processes."

Its goal is to  construct and apply new invariants, structure theorems and normal  forms of control systems under time-independent, time-dependent,  and dynamic feedback. The tools involve the method of equivalence  as refined by the principal investigator, exterior differential  systems, and the theory of infinite pseudogroups. An important  principle is the enlargement of the notion of feedback  equivalence to the fully nonlinear category. This program has  resulted in major improvements in exact linearization algorithms.  Similar ideas will be used to investigate algorithms for other  applicable normal forms such as standard bilinear systems. A new  concept of control structure, a more global viewpoint of  nonsingular control systems, will also be investigated.       The theory of feedback control systems, originally motivated  by problems in engineering, occupies a central place in applied  mathematics and is fundamental to control engineering  applications. This project will develop the geometric foundations  that underlie the dynamics of high-performance automatic control  systems. It focuses primarily on systems that have highly  nonlinear dynamics and which may have many interconnected  components influencing each other. The engineering demands for  ever higher performance, or even optimality, often require  completely new control designs since classical linearization  techniques for control design is often inadequate in such  situations. By employing techniques from various areas of pure  mathematics, such as differential geometry, major improvements in  exact linearization algorithms, with applications to nonlinear  autopilot design, for example, are expected."

Waterman Award. The award is presented to a promising scientist,  no more than 35 years of age, who is judged by a selection  committee, the Director of the Foundation and the National  Science Board, to be in the forefront of his/her field. The award  which has been given annually since 1976, is in commemoration of  the Foundation's first director, Dr. Alan T. Waterman. Professor  Tian's research area is complex differential geometry and the  analysis of partial differential equations. Much of the deep and  technically intricate work he has pursued has been motivated by  several fundamental problems in mathematical physics related to  Einstein's field equations and string theory. His accomplishments  include the solution of the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics  on complex surfaces, the proof that the moduli space of Kaehler-  Einstein metrics with zero first Chern class is nonsingular, the  proof of the stability of algebraic manifolds by using Kahler-  Einstein metrics and the systematic study, with S.T. Yau, of  Kaehler-Einstein metrics on the complements of divisors  satisfying certain positivity conditions. More recently, his work  on quantum cohomology and the `mirror symmetry' problem, is  considered by physicists to be of fundamental importance in the  advancement of string theory as a potential candidate for a  unified theory of matter and of the universe.       The award greatly encourages and brings much inspiration to  such a developing scientist and to his peers. Professor Tian is  poised to make further breakthroughs in his field and thus  advancing mathematical and scientific knowledge generally.  Already his contributions to mathematical physics are very  substantial relative to the mission of interdisciplinary research  as endorsed by the Foundation. Professor Tian will also be  working w ith postdoctoral assistants and graduate students and in  turn will be assisting in the development of the careers of his  junior colleagues. Professor Tian's career as a research  mathematician befits his recognition as a major contributor to  the scientific infrastructure and cultural advancement of the  United States."

The mathematical model is based on the generalized  wave-continuity equation for wave height, the non-conservative  form of the momentum equations for velocity, and the  advection-diffusion equation for transport.  The numerical  solution techniques are based on mixed and Galerkin finite element  methods.  For advection processes they study both characteristic  and higher-order Godunov methods.  These algorithms are  implemented on parallel platforms, including clusters of  workstations and massively parallel systems.  Domain decomposition  techniques are used to achieve parallelism.  Once the codes are  developed and validated, they are applied to bay and estuarine  modeling and modeling of storm surges along the Gulf of Mexico.       The objective of this research is to formulate, analyze and  implement accurate and efficient parallel algorithms for modeling  flow and transport in surface water environments.  The impetus for  this research is the need for state and federal agencies and  private industry to understand the effects of tides on coastal  regions and offshore structures, and to study the effects of  industrial and municipal development on bays and estuaries.  More  specifically, this work has applications in several areas,  including 1) calculating tidal ranges and surges caused by extreme  storm events such as hurricanes in order to plan development in  coastal areas and predict potential hazards from flooding; 2)  modeling tidal fluctuations for those interested in capturing  tidal energy for commercial purposes; 3) estimating forces on  offshore structures; 4) predicting influence of dredging of  intercoastal waterways or constructing breakwaters; 5) studying  effects of pollution on bays and estuaries, including possible  remediation strategies; and 6) allocating allowable discharges for  municipalities in order to meet spec ific water quality objectives.  The algorithms developed under this grant improve upon existing  algorithms by effectively using massively parallel computers to  increase resolution and reduce the computational time for a  simulation.  The code to be developed serves as paradigm for a new  generation of software that takes advantage of the trend in  high-performance computing toward massively parallel  architectures."

It concerned with the  determination of the extent to which the spectrum of the Laplace-  Beltrami operator of a compact Riemannian manifold determines the  geometry of the manifold.  Recent examples show, for instance,  that the spectrum alone does not determine manifolds up to  isometry.  Further work will also be done in efforts to  understand how manifolds can be isospectral yet not even locally  isometric.  Examples growing out of these examples provide  excellent opportunities to identify specific local geometric  invariants which are not spectrally determined.  Work related to  isospectral plane domains will also continue.  Constructions of  such domains are surprisingly simple; they arise as underlying  spaces of certain orbifolds.  Using this method, work will be  done to establish whether or not it is possible to construct  isospectral sets of non-isometric plane domains of any finite  order.  Finally, studies on Laplace versus length spectra of  hyperbolic manifolds and on the Schrodinger operator on tori and  Heisenberg manifolds will be carried out.       Analysis of domains and manifolds through the study of  classical differential operators defined on these spaces is now  an established field of geometric analysis.  One knows that  geometric properties of the domains are intertwined with  properties of the spectrum of the operators.  Results of the last  decade show that the dependence is not as simple as once thought.       This work seeks to clarify the connections and broaden the  scope of the theory's applications.  ***"

More specifically, I propose  to work in two different directions: (1) Dynamics of coupled  relaxation oscillators and (2) Persistence of invariant sets in  Hamiltonian systems.  The first of these directions aims at  understanding what happens when simple oscillators are coupled  together. Systems of this kind arise in numerous physical settings,  particularly in biology and electric circuits.  While an individual  oscillator behaves in a simple and predictable way, several such  simple ""cells"" put together can behave in a totally unexpected and  mysterious way. I propose to study the ""anatomy"" of this interaction  of simple ""cells"" which produces complex and rich behavior of the  ""organism"".  The second topic, in contrast to the first,  deals with  Hamiltonian systems which model many situation where energy  dissipation can be neglected, such as motion of particles in particle  accelerators, geometric optics and celestial mechanics. There are  still deep fundamental unanswered questions in the theory of such  systems due to their richness and complexity, although remarkable  progress has been made in the 1960s (the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser  theory) and in 1980's (the Aubry-Mather theory). It is proposed to  address some of these questions on a particular class of systems  (first introduced by Hedlund) which is more tractable than the general  case on the one hand, but is sufficiently rich to give new insights  and hints on the other.    Two research directions are proposed: first, the dynamics of coupled  relaxation oscillators, and second, persistence of invariant sets in  Hamiltonian systems.  In the first of these areas I propose to develop  qualitative theory of coupled relaxation oscillators, extending the  classical work of Cartwright--Littlewood as well as the more recent  work  on periodically forced relaxation oscillators.  In the last  couple of years two int eresting phenomena were discovered in this  area, and I hope that there are more to be found.  The second of the  two directions deals with understanding the behavior of invariant  sets in symplectic maps of R^4 under strong perturbations from the  integrable case. I plan   to consider a special class of systems,  namely, geodesic flows on a 3D torus with a particular kind of  Riemannian metric introduced by Hedlund. This is sufficiently simple  to be tractable on the one hand and yet sufficiently nontrivial to  give insight into the general situation."
