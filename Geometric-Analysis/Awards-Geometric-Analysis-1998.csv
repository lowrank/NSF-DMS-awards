The<br/>first is focused in the investigations in developing and using<br/>nonlinear analysis of partial differential equations to study<br/>formations of singularities in various problems, arising from<br/>theoretical physics mostly in differential geometrical settings,<br/>including harmonic maps, Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, harmonic map flows,<br/>and curvature driven flows.  The main approach is based on scaling<br/>methods.  One problem that I am working on now is to understand some<br/>finer structure of the compactified spaces of solutions (harmonic<br/>maps).  This is an essential problem for one to understand the<br/>formation and nature of singularities.  The second part is the<br/>investigation of the interplay of geometry and analysis.  The central<br/>problems are to understand the best constants in sharp Sobolev type<br/>inequalities in terms of the isoperimetric constants, and to<br/>understand how the local analytic quantities are related to the global<br/>geometry even the topology.  One of the approach is to study the<br/>spectral theory of various natural differential operators associated<br/>with the geometry, especially the conformally covariant geometric<br/>differential operators.<br/><br/>The formation and nature of singularities in nature are of enormous <br/>interests to human beings.  The kind of singularities that will be <br/>studied in the proposed project are particularly of great interests to <br/>the material sciences and meteorology.  For instance, the formation <br/>and nature of singularities in Ginzburg-Landau problems as a <br/>particular case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory was proposed to study <br/>super-conductivity and other super-fluids phenomena.  The effect of <br/>the scale that one uses to describe the system turns out to be very <br/>important.  This explains that to understand anything that survives <br/>under changes of scales is very crucial.  Therefore our main approach <br/>is based on the scaling methods.  The second research topics in the <br/>proposed project is basically aiming at developing and understanding <br/>some mathematical tools that are expected to be essential for the <br/>first topics.  The proposed project is also closely tied with the <br/>graduate program in the department of Mathematics at UCSC by a plan to <br/>generate research activities to the benefit of graduate student <br/>interested in this area.<br/>"

The former includes the study of the classical Birkhoff billiards, dual (or outer) billiards, and projective billiards.  The techniques include symplectic topology, KAM theory, Aubry-Mather theory, integral geometry, and symbolic dynamics. The latter includes applications of ""quantum"" topology to Legendrian and transverse knots and links, study of the recently introduced contact homology rings and their applications, and applications of Sturm theory and the theory of generating functions to the global geometry of Legendrian curves.      The motivation for the study of billiards is two-fold.  First of all, mathematical billiards are intimately related to geometrical optics, and progress in the study of billiards may have practical applications in optics.  Secondly, billiards provide a very good model in the theory of dynamical systems, and many developments in various areas of dynamical systems have been stimulated by problems from the theory of mathematical billiards.  The theory of Legendrian curves belongs to the intersection of two very active research areas: symplectic topology and knot theory. Both have deep connections with theoretical physics: the former, with classical mechanics; the latter, with quantum physics. The Legendrian knot theory provides a good testing ground for symplectic topology and knot theory, and progress in the former will stimulate new developments in these fundamental theories."

For the second problem, our goal is to classify<br/>asymptotically locally Euclidean Ricci-flat four-manifolds via<br/>Seiberg-Witten theory. This is related to the generalized positive<br/>action conjecture of Hawking and Pope.  For the third problem, note<br/>that a remarkable consequence of the existence of a Kaehler-Einstein<br/>metric on a Kaehler surface is the Miyaoka-Yau inequality between the<br/>Euler characteristic number and signature of the underlying<br/>four-manifold of the Kaehler surface.

The aim is to develop effective methods for<br/>computing Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds and<br/>enumerative invariants of algebraic manifolds.  The main thrust is a<br/>continuing project with E. Ionel on a gluing formula for Gromov<br/>invariants under the operation of `symplectic connect sum'.  The idea<br/>is to collapse the connect sum to a singular manifold, keeping track<br/>of the holomorphic curves along the way.  Parker and Ionel have<br/>already obtained a gluing formula in special cases; these imply the<br/>well-known recent formula of Caporaso-Harris.  A general gluing<br/>formula should be an effective new tool for computing Gromov and<br/>enumerative invariants.  A second part of the project seeks to for<br/>answer the following question.  Suppose C is curve that is<br/>J-holomorphic for some non-generic J. If one perturbs J to a nearby<br/>generic J', how many J'-holomorphic curves are there close to C?<br/>Several well-known problems in enumerative geometry, some solved, some<br/>unsolved, reduce to this problem.  Parker and Ionel have an approach<br/>based on the `Taubes obstruction bundle' .  The last part of the<br/>project suggests using modified Gromov invariants to obtain invariants<br/>that count curves which exist only for special classes of almost<br/>complex structures.<br/><br/>One of the most basic problems in mathematics is to determine the<br/>solutions of a system of polynomial equations, and an important first<br/>step toward that goal is to determine the NUMBER of solutions.  There<br/>is an explicit formula for the number of simultaneous solutions of a<br/>set of n polynomials in n variables.  One can then ask for the number<br/>of solutions for n polynomials in n-1 variables.  In this case there<br/>is a free parameter, so the locus of solutions will be a union of<br/>curves.  How many?  This question has been systematically studied for<br/>100 years, but only a few special cases were solved.  Then, around<br/>1990, it was realized that these problems can be translated into<br/>symplectic geometry, and then tackeled using the powerful machinery of<br/>mathematical gauge theory.  (Gauge theory, originally part of physics,<br/>has been the focus of many very fruitful interactions between<br/>mathematicians and physicists over the past twenty years; it includes<br/>Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten theory, and String theory).  This<br/>`Gromov invariant' approach led quickly to formulas answering some of<br/>the original enumerative problems, and there are clear indications<br/>that there are more to be discovered.  This project is aimed toward<br/>further developing the symplectic gauge theory in order to produce<br/>additional general formulas, and to meld these formulas into a<br/>coherent theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Continuing   his (joint with S. Ivanov) research in the large-scale geometry of   periodic metrics, D. Burago proposes to study the asymptotic volume   growth for Finsler tori; a related problem is to analyze   area-minimizing properties of affine subspaces in Banach spaces.  This   may help to understand how the absence of conjugate points for a   Lagrangian system on a torus is reflected in the dynamics of its   geodesic flow.  D. Burago also proposes to continue his analysis of   higher dimensional analogs for geometric conclusions of Aubry-Mather   theory.  Trying to further understand the relationship between   biLipschitz equivalence and quasi-isometries, it is natural to   consider such cases where density arguments (developed by the proposer   jointly with B. Kleiner) do not work; the most striking of such cases   include Penrose tilings and uniform lattices.  Continuing his (joint   with S. Ferleger, A. Kononenko) study of semi-dispersing billiard   systems, D. Burago plans to investigate if their topological entropy   can be infinite.  Another problem which arose from the proposer's   method of applying singular geometry to billiard theory is   constructing CAT(0) development spaces whose geodesics represent all   billiard trajectories.  E. Johnson, the proposer's advisee, works on   applying the proposer's method to prove the unboundness for complete   surfaces of finite variation of curvature to show stability of the   class of embedded flat surfaces.    The main subjects of the proposal have very clear physical analogs.    Large-scale geometric properties of periodic metrics can be   interpreted as global properties of a periodic medium consisting of   copies of the same microscopic pattern repeated in a regular fashion,   as in crystals.  In particular, dynamical properties of geo desic flows   for periodic metrics reflect how the light or radiation spreads in   such media.  The technique developed by the proposer and his   collaborators allows us to solve many of the open problems in this   area for the most important case (quadratic Lagrangians); in general,   this circle of problems remains wide open.  The proposer's research in   the theory of billiard systems started from a problem that goes back   to Boltzmann: can one give an upper bound on the maximum number of   collisions in a given time interval in a system of several balls   colliding elastically (gas model)?  The number of collisions per time   unit plays important role in thermodynamics.  Surprisingly, this   problem has been solved by establishing a connection with singular   geometry; in its turn, this connection led to new intriguing problems   of both geometric and dynamical origin."

Much of this  work will be done with Michael Kapovich of the University of Utah.  Millson and Kapovich used the above relations to construct Artin  groups that were not the fundamental groups of smooth complex  algebraic varieties.  This work has just been accepted by the Publ.  Math. IHES.  Millson is also working with Hermann Flaschka of the  University of Arizona on constructing integrable systems on symplectic  quotients (by the adjoint representation) of products of orbits in  simple Lie algebras.  They have recently found such systems for  minimal orbits.  A critical role is played by the Aronszajn-Weinstein  formula of perturbation theory.  Their end goal is to give new insight  into the work of Lusztig and others on decomposing tensor products of  irreducible representations.       Millson's work begins with one of the first theorems of  high-school geometry -- the theorem that if two triangles have the  same set of side lengths then they are congruent.  The analogue for  quadrilaterals is clearly false: one can change a square into a  rhombus without changing the side lengths.  So one is led to try to  parametrize the set of all planar n-gons with the same side lengths.  From there one is led to a favorite theme of nineteenth century  mathematics, the study of planar linkages (systems of rods and  hinges).  In the nineteenth century such a study was of immense  practical significance -- the problem was to convert linear motion (of  a piston rod) to circular motion (turning of a wheel) by a linkage.  The problem was solved by a French naval officer, Peaucellier.  It  turns out that from the modern point of view the nineteenth century  work is insufficiently precise.  Millson and Kapovich have corrected  the  errors and written up a proof of a result (often attributed to  Thurston) that given any smooth manifold M, there is a planar linkage  whose configuration space is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of a  number of copies of M.  The above work on planar linkages led to a  study of n-gon linkages in space.  This theory is enormously richer,  connecting with symplectic geometry, integrable Hamiltonian systems,  and representation theory.  The analogous theory in spherical and  hyperbolic three-space appears to connect up with some of the newest  objects in geometry and algebra, Poisson Lie groups and quantum  groups.  ***"

First, Schwartz will continue the work that began  with his proof, in 1993, that nonuniform rank one lattices are  quasi-isometric if and only if they are commensurable.  In particular,  Schwartz will further develop the theme of action rigidity, introduced  in his 1996 Acta paper, ""Quasi-isometric rigidity and diophantine  approximation.""  Second, Schwartz will explore the ramifications of his  1997 proof of the Goldman-Parker Conjecture, which gives exact discreteness  criteria for complex hyperbolic ideal triangle groups.  This result is the  first of its kind, in that it gives the complete analysis of a nontrivial  deformation problem in complex hyperbolic space.  Third, Schwartz will  continue his work on dynamical systems defined by iterative constructions  in projective geometry.   The work here is related to birational dynamics,  abelian varieties, the KdV equation, and determinants.  Fourth, Schwartz  will develop software that aids in the understanding, communication, and  solution of geometric and dynamical problems.       The common theme to this research is that it deals with the geometric  structure of infinite, symmetric, patterns.  One should think, for example,  of tiles on the kitchen floor, or trees arrayed in an orange grove.  Informally speaking, the first area of Schwartz' research deals with the  question:  Could a fairly blind person mistake one infinite symmetric  pattern for another?  The idea is to find very ""rough"" features of an  infinite pattern that could distinguish it from another infinite pattern.    The second area of research deals with the following kinds of questions:  Imagine that an apple is suspended in space, surrounded by mirrors.  How  can you position the mirrors so that the pattern of reflections of the  apple will be nice and orderly?  The third area of research deals with  the generation of infinite patterns through the repetition of simpl e  constructions, made from pencil and paper drawings.  Often a very innocent  construction, such as the Pappus' theorem construction, yields a surprising  and beautiful geometric pattern upon infinite repetition.

Schoen    This proposal deals with three geometric variational problems.  The  first is the problem of minimizing the volume for lagrangian  submanifolds of symplectic manifolds.  This theory provides an  approach to constructing special lagrangian submanifolds of  Kahler-Einstein manifolds.  The second problem is the study of  harmonic maps which are equivariant with respect to general isometric  actions of discrete groups on spaces of nonpositive curvature.  This  theory may be applied to study many general rigidity questions for  both finite and infinite dimensional representations of discrete  groups.  The third problem concerns the variational problem for  Einstein metrics, where the problem is to compute the Yamabe invariant  in more generality, and to show that standard metrics achieve this  min-max variational characterization.    Minimization problems occur in many branches of mathematics and  science.  For example, linear programming concerns the problem of  minimizing a function (such as cost) subject to a set of constraint  inequalities, problems of navigation involve finding paths of least  length on the earth's surface, and in continuum mechanics, the  equilibrium position of an elastic membrane is determined among the  infinitely many possible positions by the condition that the potential  energy be as small as possible.  This proposal deals with certain  geometric variational problems, of which the first is the problem of  minimizing a potential energy for mappings subject to the constraint  that the mappings preserve the area.  Such problems arise in nonlinear  elasticity where the mapping represents the deformation of an elastic  body.  The problems also arise in geometry where one can use such  minimizing configurations to understand complicated geometric spaces  that arise in string theory (physics).  The second part of this  proposal deals with maps which minimize a potential energy subject to  the conditi on that they are symmetric for a complicated symmetry  group.  For example, if you consider the curve of least length which  surrounds a given area, you get a circle, while if you choose curves  which surround regions whose translates (under a fixed symmetry group)  fill up the plane, then the solution is typically a special type of  hexagon (the regular hexagon of the honeycomb if the symmetry group is  chosen suitably).  The main goal is to use the symmetric minimizing  maps to understand the possible symmetry groups and how they can arise  in important geometric situations.  The final part of the proposal  deals with equilibrium solutions of the Einstein equations of General  Relativity.  The full Einstein equations may be thought of as  describing the vibrations of the gravitational field which determines  the geometry of spacetime.  The corresponding equilibrium problem is  important in geometry, and the third part of the proposal deals with  the question of the extent to which equilibrium solutions can be  expected to minimize the potential energy."

It aims to clarify the  mathematical meaning and the scope of mirror correspondence and to  find applications of mirror symmetry. While from mathematical  viewpoint, the original discovery of mirror symmetry predicted a  relation between the enumerative geometry of manifolds from the class  of (Calabi-Yau) manifolds (i.e. the numerology of lines, quadrics,  twisted cubics etc) and differential equations or more precisely the  variation of the Hodge structure on another (Calabi-Yau) manifold,  more recent developments, mainly in physics literature, suggest  numerous additional properties of mirror correspondence.  Mirror  symmetry in the physical sense is a rather imposing condition on  manifolds, defined as a certain isomorphism of conformal field  theories associated with the manifolds and one would like to  understand its exact mathematical meaning.  The investigator is  planning to search for additional topological and geometric properties  of manifolds which will allow us to identify mirror partners, such as  behavior of their characteristic classes, elliptic genera, or other  properties which may facilitate identifying mirror partners in special  situations, e.g. for manifolds with automorphisms.  Another aspect of  the proposed study is the investigation of algebraic structures  associated with objects involved in the mirror symmetry such as  differential equations for the periods of the families of Calabi-Yau  manifolds.  As part of the study of these differential equations the  investigator plans to relate issues arising in mirror symmetry to  previous work on the fundamental groups of the complements, the  monodromy groups and the cohomology of local systems on certain  quasiprojective varieties.    Overall, the goal of the project is to attempt to bridge the gap  between physical and mathematical understanding found in the early  1990's of the phenomenon of mirror sym metry. This will lead to better  understanding of issues which have been the focus of mathematicians  since the middle of 19th century, such as enumeration of geometric  objects, using ideas from string theory, and we hope also to bring  additional mathematical ideas to the understanding of mirror symmetry  in physics."

They have been incorporated into the renormalization theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems, played a crucial role in the foundations of higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics, enabled advances in long-standing problems in hyperbolic geometry, witnessed the solution of classical problems on analytic differential equations, and led to new concepts in  topology. The conference will bring together people looking at laminations and foliations from different points of view in the hope that it will create fruitful interactions between intimately related but somewhat separated fields.      Laminations and foliations play a fundamental role in the theory of dynamical systems, which is the general study of evolution of systems that change with time. Dynamical systems theory emerged, historically, in celestial mechanics, and has since found numerous further applications everywhere: in statistical mechanics, biology, chemistry, economics, and so on. It has deep implications for any aspect of science involving the time-evolution of complex systems.  The study of foliations is concerned with the way that a large system can be broken up into a family of smaller systems, like layers of dough in a pastry.  For  example, a physical system in which energy is conserved separates into thin layers, one for each energy level. The ability to analyze a system in this way is of crucial importance, and leads to deep connections between the dynamics and phenomena in other important subfields of mathematics, in particular, in geometry and topology. The broadly interdisciplinary nature of the subject was one of the main motivations for this conference.  With this in mind, the conference will be strongly directed towards the interests of graduate students and young researchers, who will have a chance to see a broader perspective of mathematics in its active development.  To support this educational goal, the conference will include , in addition to the customary research lectures, a number of introductory ""mini-courses"" which will provide participants with a more comprehensive outlook on different aspects of the field."

A Finsler structure on a  manifold M assigns a notion of length to each tangent vector in M,  leading to a notion of length for paths in M. Riemannian geometry is a  special case where the length is derived from an inner product on  tangent spaces.  Finsler structures are essentially geometrized  calculus of variation problems and the fundamental problems involve  studying paths that are extremals of length (i.e., the geodesics),  their stability properties, their computability, and so forth.  As in  the familiar Riemannian case, the geometric object that controls  stability of geodesics is a sort of curvature tensor, called the flag  curvature.  Bryant plans to develop classification and global existence  theorems for Finsler structures with constant flag curvature, using  exterior differential systems techniques.  The second main problem  arises in certain models of super-symmetric string  theory that require  the construction on a smooth manifold of a connection  with reduced  holonomy, perhaps with torsion, out of a Riemannian metric and a  three-form.  The problem is to classify which pairs of metric and  three-form will allow the physical theory to be super-symmetric.   Bryant has already done the classification in various low dimensions  and is ready to study the intermediate dimensions (six through  twenty-six) that are of physical interest, using the techniques of  exterior differential systems that contributed to the solution of the  holonomy problem in the classical case (in which the three-form was  identically zero).  Bryant also plans to continue his collaboration  with Griffiths and Hsu on the geometry of PDE and their conservation  laws and to generalize  his recent structure theorems for harmonic  morphisms.    Optimization is a central problem in mathematics, in which one tries to  select the 'best' configuration in the space of possible configurations  in a model for a physical system.  An example is the problem of  navigating on a body of water in which one must take water currents  into account in planning the 'best' path from origin to destination,  where 'best' is taken to mean 'shortest time of traverse'.   A path  that is optimal for a short period (a 'geodesic') might not remain  optimal if pursued long enough.  This is known as instability.  (For  example, in a river where the current is faster in midstream it turns  out that downstream geodesics are stable, but that upstream geodesics  are not.)  The geometric quantity that measures this notion of  stability is known as 'curvature', since it was first identified in  studies of the curvature of the Earth. Bryant's work studies curvature  and 'over-determined' systems of differential equations, and is  relevant to optimization problems in motion planning, control theory,  robotics, and string theory models in high energy physics."

In several recent joint papers with Yum-Tong Siu, the investigator has solved a conjecture of Lang about the value distribution of an entire holomorphic curve with respect to an ample divisor, and in dimension two essentially solved a conjecture of Kobayashi about hyperbolicity of the complement of a curve in the complex projective plane; research in this direction will be continued.  A long term goal is to understand the relation of complex hyperbolicity to diophantine approximation theory.  In the second part of the proposal, the author considers several aspects of manifolds with negative curvature.  In the past the author has studied several aspects of uniformization of such manifolds with different conditions attached.  He proposes to work on several directions related to his earlier research projects, including study of geometric and analytic aspects of such a manifold and their relations to its universal covering, fundamental group and Betti numbers.           In geometry, people study models which on one hand should be elegant and relatively simple to discribe and on the other hand should display rich geometric structures.  A well chosen negatively curved space happens to be a good candidate to study.  The study of curved or non-flat spaces is very natural from a physics point of view because as a result of general relativity, people realize that the model of the universe itself is not flat.

One program  investigates the magnification cross sections of caustic-curve  networks due to generic multiplane weak-field gravitational lens  systems.  The other program studies the links between the global  geometry of the optical caustic surfaces in a spacetime (e.g., along  our past light cone or about rotating black holes) and the  singularities of the associated spacetime metric.  These issues point  to a new and promising direction in the mathematical theory of optical  caustics.  Furthermore, their rigorous treatment may also lead to a  deeper understanding of the flux enhancement of gravitationally lensed  quasars and their overdensity around foreground galaxies, and rapid  X-ray variability in active galactic nuclei.  Equally important, such  investigations may reveal new and powerful ways of understanding and  organizing fundamental physical concepts in gravitational lensing, and  can provide a theoretical check on results from numerical simulations.      Gravitational lensing is the deflection of light from a distant source  (e.g., quasar, extended galaxy) by an intervening matter distribution  (e.g., galaxy, cluster of galaxies).  When foreground galaxies magnify  background quasars, it causes an ``amplification bias'' in certain  quasar samples.  This has led to a mathematically difficult and  physically important problem in gravitational lensing: Determine the  probability that a light source is magnified greater than some  specified amount.  A rigorous study of this problem directly bears on  the the issue of ``magnification bias.''  Another important problem is  to investigate gravitational lensing by dynamical lenses (e.g.,  rotating black holes).  This is physically relevant since most  galaxies seem to have black holes at their centers.  Moreover,  gravitational lensing by a rotatin g black hole may account for rapid  X-ray variability in active galactic nuclei.  The aforementioned  problems will lead me to interact with astrophysicists and astronomers  for physics discussions and latest observations, computer scientists  for sophisticated numerical codes running on high-performance  computers, and mathematicians for issues in singularity theory and  differential geometry.  Also, implicit with this general aim is  isolating and studying the underlying mathematical structures invoked  by gravitational lensing.  Once determined, these structures can then  be made available as potential mathematical tools for other physical  systems (possibly shock formation in fluids) that may call upon them."

Specifically,  he is proposing to consider the question of whether the  top-dimensional part of the singular set locally lies in a finite  union of smooth submanifolds, which he has recently established for 3  and 4 dimensional mod-2 minimizing submanifolds in codimension 2.  Simon also proposes to continue his efforts to develop methods for  generating examples of singular sets, and to pursue several questions  related to asymptotics on approach to singularities.  In addition he  proposes to study questions related to the structure of the branching  set of energy minimizing maps.  Brian White plans to study how  regularity properties and singular structure for minimizing chains  with coefficients in a metric group depend on the group and its  metric.  This includes study of immiscible fluid interfaces as a  special case.  He also plans to investigate singularities in the  mean-curvature flow and in a related hyperbolic flow that should more  accurately model the dynamics of real soap films.  He will also  continue his investigations of branch points in 2 dimensional minimal  surfaces.    An understanding of singularities, and how singularities are formed,  is a fundamental element in the overall understanding of many physical  and geometric phenomena.  For example, in cosmology singularities of  space-time (e.g.  ""black holes"") play a fundamental role.  Likewise in  the study of the ""canonical"" objects which arise naturally in topology  and geometry, the understanding of singularities is absolutely  fundamental.  As with most non-linear phenomena, there is no single  well ordered theory which a pplies in a wide range of different  contexts.  Rather, each different context has its own collection of  effective techniques, and it is the development and application of  such techniques in the context of the geometric calculus of variations  which is the focus of the present research proposal.  Specifically,  Simon and White propose to continue their efforts toward a complete  understanding of singularities, and how they are formed, in the  context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy minimizing maps.  Such techniques are likely to be applicable to the study of other  objects of geometric and physical significance---for example to the  study of immiscible fluid interfaces, soap-films, and the equilibrium  free surfaces of fluids."

The investigator  will develop a general procedure for translating problems in this  area into combinatorial questions involving the monodromy of a  family of codimension 2 submanifolds.  It is expected that this  will apply, in principle, both to the classification problem for  symplectic manifolds and also to Lagrangian submanifolds and  symplectomorphisms.

Particular attention will be paid to the role of the Floer  homology groups obtained from the monodromy. One subsidiary topic  in the project involves research into the geometry of Kahler  metrics: the specific goals here are to prove the existence of  certain geodesics in the space of Kahler metrics, and apply these  to Calabi's extremal metric program. This existence question is  a version of the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous  Monge-Ampere equation, a topic of independent interest. The other  subsidiary topic involves research into manifolds with exceptional  holonomy groups, and particularly the search for new examples,  obtained using complex 3-folds as building blocks.    Complex numbers, made up of real and imaginary components, are  fundamental throughout mathematics. In geometry, it has been  realised since the middle of the last century that properties of  the complex number system are intimately bound up with the  geometry and topology of 2-dimensional spaces. The elaboration of  this theme, and its extension to higher dimensions, has been one  of the main achievements of twentieth century mathematics.

Among the specific goals are to extend his earlier application of harmonic analysis and heat kernel techniques to compute the exact size (in terms of Hausdorff measures) of the limit sets of Kleinian groups to new examples (e.g., manifolds with thin parts) and new sets (the conical limit set, the set of escaping geodesics,...).  He will also attempt to extend Bowen's famous dichotomy to all divergence type Fuchsian groups, extending work of Sullivan, Astala, Zinsmeister, Jones and himself. Part of this is to further study the ``beta''s, a technical measure of how close a set is to a line segment at different scales, which is closely related to the study of the traveling salesman problem.  He will also continue his work investigating the removable and non-removable sets for quasi-conformal mappings, geometric properties of Brownian motion, and other geometric-analytic questions in classical complex analysis.<br/><br/><br/>The proposal deals with a variety of geometric questions which are united by a desire to understand traditional concepts and calculations (e.g. compute the area of a region) in non-traditional and highly non-smooth cases.  This is motivated by (at least) two points of view.  First, a better understanding of the classical case can be obtained by seeing how it succeeds or fails in a more general setting; even the failures lead to new, interesting phenomena to investigate.  Second, many applications of mathematics (polymers, fractures, shock waves, wavelet analysis, crystal growth,...) involve highly irregular and fractal objects, and we need to understand and calculate with such objects the way we have always done with much smoother quantities.  For example, Brownian motion is a mathematical object which models random movement and is of tremendous intrinsic interest, as well as being fundamental to understanding many other random processes (e.g., shapes of long polymers chains, growth of crystals by random accretion, ...). However, Brownian motion is an extremely non-smooth process and various simple geometric questions about its random paths are still unknown.  Another example is with the Kleinian groups mentioned above.  These are symmetries in non-Euclidean geometry; as such, they are fundamental objects in topology and have been an area of intense investigation for many years.  They can be associated with certain fractal objects (the limit sets) involving non-linear rescalings, where the non-linearity is of a very special type, and present a theoretical stepping stone between self-similar sets with linear rescalings (which are fairly well understood) and much more complicated rescalings found in rational dynamics and chaos theory. <br/><br/>"

These deformation invariants arise as cohomology classes in  various invariant variational bicomplexes defined on the jet spaces of  the given differential relation.  The objectives of this research  proposal are to develop new methods for the computation of these  localized deformation invariants, to study the properties of these  invariants through the use of jet bundle techniques, and to develop  new applications of formal geometry in global analysis, integrable  systems and mathematical physics.  Three avenues of research are  proposed.  The first project will explore the relationships between  the variational bicomplex for two differential equations which are  related by one of the various integration or reduction methods, some  of which date back to Lie and Vessiot.  The second project is based  upon two new extensions of the inverse problem of the calculus of  variations.  One extension is directed towards the existence and  classification of Hamiltonian structures; the other extension seeks to  characterize integral invariants arising in global analysis such as  the Kazdan-Warner integrals which obstruct the solution to the  prescribed curvature problem.  The third project is motivated by the  role that the variational bicomplex plays in the general theory of  characteristic classes and seeks to generalize this role to general  pseudo-group actions on fiber bundles using the method of moving  frames and differential invariant theory.    The prevalent theme of the proposed work is symmetry.  By the symmetry  of an object one means the group of motions in space which leave the  object unchanged.  The symmetry of a cube includes discrete rotations  by 90 degrees about each one of its 3 axis.  The symmetry group of a  sphere includes the continuous rotations t hrough any angle about any  axis through the center of the sphere.  In problems in applied  mathematics, differential geometry and mathematical physics, one is  interested in the symmetries which leave the governing (differential)  equations unchanged.  Such symmetries are extremely important in  studying both the analytical and qualitative features of the governing  equations.  Indeed, almost all known exact solutions of important  non-linear equations (such as the Einstein, Yang-Mills, or harmonic  map equations) have a high degree of symmetry and can be obtained by  symmetry methods.  Nevertheless, there are many theoretical and  practical issues yet to be studied.  In particular, theoretical  techniques which have previously been computationally inaccessible can  now be investigated using powerful symbolic mathematics computer  programs."

The principal investigators plan to generalize the theory to objects more general than convex bodies and extend the theory in the same way that the theory of Lp spaces extends the theory of L1 and L2 spaces.  They will also continue work on the creation of a dual of the Brunn-Minkowski theory, where intersections replace projections.  Following on this, they intend to study the partial differential equations which arise in this extended Brunn-Minkowski theory, specifically generalizations of the classical Minkowski problem. A central part of this work is establishing new isoperimetric inequalities within the extended Brunn-Minkowski theory and its dual.    The theory of mixed volumes has already found a wide variety of applications ranging from statistics to geometric tomography. (Geometric tomography is the subject which attempts to describe three-dimensional objects from lower dimensional information such as X-rays, projections, or sections of the objects in question.)  The principal investigators intend to extend and build new analogs of this important mathematical theory.  A central part of this work will involve the invention (or discovery) of new isoperimetric inequalities.  These inequalities, in particular affine isoperimetric inequalities, have proven to be of importance in subjects ranging from partial differential equations to geometric tomography to image analysis.

Minicozzi    This project has two main directions.  First, we are studying function  theory, for functions and sections of bundles, on manifolds with a  lower curvature bound.  Typically, we are interested in spaces of  harmonic functions or sections which satisfy certain growth conditions  on complete noncompact manifolds.  As is evident from our prior  research, this problem is closely related to uniform eigenvalue  estimates on compact manifolds for both functions and sections of  bundles.  This second problem has an interesting connection to the  study of asymptotics for semiclassical limits in mathematical physics  and to questions which come from complex differential geometry.  Second, we are studying convergence and compactness of minimal  surfaces with an emphasis on the case where there is no a priori area  or total curvature bound.  If the area of a sequence of minimal  surfaces is unbounded, a classical limit cannot exist; however, often  we can extract geometrically interesting generalized limits.  There  are examples where, for topological reasons, such sequences of  embedded minimal surfaces with controlled topology can be constructed.    This project has two main directions both of which involve the  interplay between geometry and analysis.  The first direction involves  the study of Laplace operators on manifolds.  Our primary interest is  in how the basic properties of these differential operators depend on  the geometry of the space.  This sort of question is fundamental and  has been relevant in many different areas of mathematics (including  geometry, topology, complex geometry, and mathematical physics).  The  second main direction of this project is to study spaces of minimal  surfaces in three manifolds.  Minimal surfaces, which are critical  points for area, are interesting physical, geometric, and analytic  objects."

The special case of symplectic  manifolds with large torus actions is particularly amenable to study.  Working with Y. Karshon, S.

The principal investigators plan to use these methods  to find necessary and sufficient conditions for such a space to admit  an invariant Kaehler structure.  S. Tolman also hopes to use these  techniques and recent results in symplectic topology to extend the  results to tori of dimension two less than half the dimension of the  manifold.  The investigators also plan to address the question of  invariants of reduced spaces, and together with T. Tokieda they will  investigate the capacity of symplectic quotients.  They will also  study the cohomology of reduced spaces, both at regular values (joint  work by S. Tolman and J.  Weitsman), and at singular values (joint  with J. Ho.)  Finally, E. Lerman (jointly with T. Tokieda) will study  the two body problem on the two sphere -- a limiting case of two  coupled rigid bodies.  The techniques include classifying relative  equilibria, the energy-momentum method, and numerical simulation.    On the scale of everyday life, essentially all objects follow paths  determined by the laws of classical mechanics.  In many cases -- for  example, a spinning top, two coupled rigid bodies, a satellite with  flexible attachments, or the solar system itself -- the mechanical  system possesses a  great deal of symmetry.  In these cases, for each  degree of symmetry there is a conserved quantity, called ``momentum''.  Linear and angular momentum are the most common examples of this  phenomena.  A great deal can be learned about such systems both by  studying the momentum, and by ``dividing out'' by the set of  symmetries to study a simpler system.  We study systems which, while  not necessarily examples of concrete physical systems, abstract out  many of the common features of such systems.  We intend to study,  among other questions, what happens when systems have very large  amounts of symmetry, how to deal with singularities which sometimes  arise in ``dividing out'' by symmetries, and how to use the momentum  to answer important questions about the system.  Our work,including  both the results and some of the methods we plan to develop, should be  useful to scientists and engineers studying concrete physical systems."

The   main tool is a particularly adapted theory of holomorphic curves,   which has been developed by the principal investigator and his   co-workers in recent years.  The fact, that there is a such a close,   but completely unexpected, relationship between some important class   of dynamical systems and a suitable theory of holomorphic curves has   deep implications.  Immediately it makes it, in principle, feasible to   relate questions about an important class of dynamical systems to   recent mathematical theories like quantum cohomology, Gromov-Witten   invariants, and in low dimensions even to Seiberg-Witten invariants.    The fact, that two intersecting holomorphic curves in a   four-dimensional space have always a positive intersection number   implies that these new methods are most powerful for Reeb vector   fields on a three-dimensional space.  The main goal of this project   will be the development of a mathematical machinery for constructing   global surfaces of section for three-dimensional Reeb flows and   generalisations thereof.  In practice this means that the study of   certain three-dimensional dynamical systems can effectively be reduced   to two dimensions.    The importance and scope of Reeb dynamics is illustrated by the   following examples.  The motion of a satellite in the presence of the   gravitational forces of the sun, the planets and the moon is described   mathematically as the dynamics of a Reeb vector field.  A charged   particle moving in an electrical and a magnetic field is described by   a Reeb vector field if the magnetic field is not too large or the   kinetic energy of the particle is sufficiently large.  The motion of   the particles of an ideal incompressible fluid in some system of pipes   is, if the motion is in an equilibrium (steady) state, described by a   Reeb vector field if the pressure is not too far f rom being constant.    Also many evolution equations of mathematical physics, which describe   systems, in which energy is preserved, can sometimes be approximated   by finite-dimensional dynamical systems, which are described by a Reeb   vector field.  Such approximations are of course necessary if one   tries to find solutions for such equations by using a computer."

This project will also pursue an investigation of the many deep and previously unexploited connections between convex geometry and algebraic combinatorial theory, with the particular end of the development of a combinatorial theory of invariant valuations and kinematic formulas on finite lattices, (where the invariance is with respect to the action of an automorphism group).  A central goal of this investigation is the development and application of combinatorial analogues to Hadwiger's characterization theorem for invariant valuations and to classical kinematic formulas in the context of partially ordered sets, with a special focus on the combinatorial structures that arise in convex geometry.     Convex geometry and the theory of valuations treat the fundamental question of how to measure (or in the case of finite features, to enumerate) and ultimately to characterize intrinsic features of geometric objects. Examples include the reconstruction of information about a geometric object from limited data, such as information about projections and shadows (stereology) or slices and cross-sections (tomography).  These techniques lead in turn to many applications, such as those in biotechnology (such as molecular biology), economics and finance (analysis of efficient and equitable distributions of limited resources over a population), and computer graphics (the visual display of information)."

In two dimensions the object in question is the  moduli space of flat connections over a surface.  This space appears  in contexts as diverse as algebraic geometry and quantum gauge theory:  it is the moduli space of representations of the fundamental group of  a surface, it has arisen in the study of certain invariants of  three-dimensional manifolds, and in certain contexts it is the moduli  space of certain types of bundles over a surface.  Dr.  Sengupta has  been led to study the structure and nature of the moduli space through  his investigation of a limiting classical form of an infinite  dimensional measure which arises in the quantum theoretic study of  gauge fields.  This investigation will study the infinite-dimensional  quantum field theoretic measure, understand the way in which it  condenses onto a natural volume measure on the moduli space, and  extract information about the structure and volumes of the various  strata of this space.  This investigator believes that much  topological information about the moduli space of flat connections is  contained in the Yang-Mills probability measure.  It is hoped that  this project will provide a fruitful example of how probability theory  can be used to understand topology in this context.  In three  dimensions, this project aims to develop a rigorous analysis of the  quantum-field theoretic functional integrals arising in Chern-Simons  theory and understand, at a rigorous level, their relationship with  topological invariants.  These investigations will also provide new  concrete non-linear problems and techniques, involving stochastic  processes on Lie groups, in infinite-dimensional Gaussian analysis.    In broad terms, this project inv estigates mathematical questions that  arise from the deep relationship between geometry, topology, and  physics.  The idea that space, time, and matter can be understood in  terms of geometry forms the foundation of Einstein's general theory of  relativity.  Later, as the study of quantum theory and elementary  particles developed, it was discovered through the works of Yang,  Mills, and others, that geometry and topology play an even deeper and  more subtle role in mediating the fundamental forces of nature.  In  recent years, many mathematicians have focused their attention on deep  problems in topology and geometry which arise from questions in  fundamental particle physics.  The mathematics here is often  understood at a rough and intuitive level.  This project is devoted to  putting some of these mathematical issues on firm foundations as well  as discovering new results in the mathematical setting."

Specifically, we consider measured  Gromov-Haudorff limits of (possibly collapsing) sequences of  riemannian manifolds with a definite lower (or two sided) Ricci  curvature bound (including Einstein manifolds), corresponding limits  of manifolds with a definite two sided sectional curvature bound and  metric measure spaces (possibly fractal in nature) which satisfy a  doubling condition on the measure and a Poincar'e inequality. A  central concern is that of proving ``partial regularity theorems''.  Such theorems assert that the underlying space is regular (in a  suitable sense) off a set which is of measure zero or even of some  definite positive codimension.    Throughout mathematics and physics one finds a tension between the  notions of ``regularity'' and ``singularity''.  For instance, a  ``typical'' object (one which is chosen completely at random) will,  with high probability, be very irregular (or even singular).  On the  other hand, the most fundamental geometric shapes, say that of round  sphere, exhibit symmetry, homgeneiety, and smoothness.  In any event, in  many (if not most) problems of interest, singularities are simply  ``there'' and cannot be avoided (e.g. ``black holes'').  In such  cases, in becomes important to study the extent and structure of the  singularities.  This is precisely the focus of our project.  We  consider the problem for some very general but extremly natural  classes of geometric objects."

The latter include general compact sets, but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies, or finite sets. One advantage of this setting is that it becomes more probable that inverse problems have a unique solution.  Generally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of uniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information than would otherwise be possible. This can lead to algorithms that are more effective when few measurements are available, and less sensitive to measurement errors or noise. Within mathematics, geometric tomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry, Minkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will focus on several topics in this area and continue the development of geometric tomography begun in two previous NSF proposals. New directions include reconstruction of objects from measurements of volumes of projections onto planes or concurrent sections by planes, stability questions related to sections, and the systematic development of discrete tomography (involving inverse problems concerning finite sets). Examples of proposed techniques are the use of recently discovered Fourier transform formulas and of special bodies defined by $p$th means of metric quantities. Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.    CAT scanners are machines that save lives daily. They take X-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the information to create an image of a two-dimensional section of part of the body. The mathematics behind this process is called computerized tomography. It is very successful, but not perfect; the reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better picture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays, causing greater expense and likelihood of side effects. In geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects ar e allowed-the density of the object is the same everywhere inside it. An example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney. One can use this information to find better reconstruction procedures. The scope of geometric tomography is actually much wider. Any measurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered. Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both in mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the geometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside. For example, a new technique in electron microscopy allows measurement of the number of atoms in a crystal lying on certain lines. The material scientist wants to reconstruct the crystal from this information. The object in this case-the crystal-is mathematically represented by a finite set of points.  This project continues the development of several aspects of the mathematics of geometric tomography."

The second part of the  project consists of deriving the exact triangles formulae that detect  how the Seiberg-Witten Floer homology changes when the three-manifold  is modified by surgery and a suitable cutting and pasting technique  that relates the Seiberg-Witten invariants of four-manifolds and  three-manifolds. The remaining part of the project is dedicated to the  investigation of the relation between the Seiberg-Witten Floer  homology and the instanton Floer homology associated to Donaldson  theory.    The discovery of the Seiberg-Witten invariants, as an outcome of  recent developments in string theory, has had a tremendous impact in  the field of low dimensional topology. The rich interplay of geometry  and theoretical physics has allowed a deeper understanding of the  geometric structure of three and four-dimensional manifolds.  The  topology and geometry of three and four-dimensional manifolds is known  to be especially rich of interesting phenomena and open problems: the  failure of the classification methods used in higher dimensions makes  it particularly important to construct computable invariants, hence  the need to investigate the properties of the Seiberg-Witten  invariants and their relation to the previously known  Yang-Mills-Donaldson theory."

The third studies the Euler systems of Kolyvagin in a general<br/>motivic context.  The fourth project will study certain ""circle<br/>method-type questions"" related to the ABC conjecture. Professor Taubes<br/>work centers on two topics.  The first deals with the theory of<br/>pseudo-holomorphic curves for the singular symplectic forms on<br/>4-manifolds which arise as self-dual harmonic 2-forms.  The regularity<br/>of these curves will be analyzed, their use in defining obstructions<br/>to symplectic form existence will be considered.  The second project<br/>studies the compactness question for various generalizations of the<br/>Seiberg-Witten equations.

The second part of Professor Bott's project studies<br/>the ways in which the symmetries of a space constrain its global<br/>structure.  Professor Mazur will be studying, first, the ABC<br/>conjecture.  This is a finiteness assertion that may govern the number<br/>of solutions to a broad collection of equations.

Professor Taubes plans to study the behavior of<br/>four dimensional spaces and to develop techniques to distinguish such<br/>spaces from each other.

Parker on gluing   formulas for the Gromov invariants of symplectic connect sums.  We have   been working on a degeneration formula that describes what happens to   holomorphic curves as one `pinches the neck' and explains how to compute   the Gromov invariants of the symplectic connect sum from the limiting   curves.  This degeneration formula has several applications that we would   like to explore.  First, one can construct new `exotic' symplectic   manifolds by cut-and-paste techniques and compute their Gromov invariants   by the degeneration formula.  This gives a practical technique for probing   how much more complicated the symplectic classification of manifolds is   compared to the smooth classification.  Secondly, the degeneration formula   leads to recursive formulas for the Gromov invariants; these could provide   answers to several old unsolved problems in enumerative algebraic geometry.    The final project suggests a method for extending Gromov-type invariants to   `nongeneric' situations.  This would provide more refined information about   the symplectic manifold.      Most of the problems in enumerative algebraic geometry are more than a   hundred years old.  The questions are easy to ask, but the progress in   solving them using classical methods has been quite slow.  Recently, the   same kind of questions arised in two dimensional topological quantuum field   theories from high energy physics.  Inspired by these theories, new methods   lead in the past couple of years to amazing progress in the field.  The   proposal explores two new ways of approaching these old problems that would   further clarify the structure of the two dimensional topological quantuum   field theories."

By using this construction, the principal   investigators were able to extend Floer homology from the semi-positive   case to all closed symplectic manifolds and consequently to solve the   non-degenerate Arnold conjecture completely.  By using certain refinements   of this construction, they established a general relationship between   non-vanishing of certain GW-invariants and the existence of closed orbits   of Hamiltonian systems.  As one of the applications of this, they solved a   stabilized version of Weinstein conjecture.  Base on these results, the   principal investigators propose further investigations on the Arnold   conjecture for degenerate case and some other unsettled cases of the   Weinstein conjecture.    Hamiltonian equations arise from classical mechanics, celestial mechanics   and many other physical systems as fundamental equations governing the   motions in such systems.  The dynamics of Hamiltonian systems describes the   evolution of the ""classical"" world.  One of the important steps to   understand the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems is to understand their   simplest dynamic behavior, the periodical orbits.  The basic questions   here, known as the Arnold conjecture and the Weinstein conjecture, are   about the existence and the number of closed orbits of Hamiltonian systems.    Both of these conjectures have been considered as main guiding problems in   the subject of symplectic topology.  The methods developed by the   investigators of this project to solve the non-degenerate Arnold conjecture   and stabilized Weinstein conjecture have opened the door for investigating   the Arnold conjecture for the degenerate case and the Weinstein conjectur e   for general symplectic manifolds."

Using the F-structure theory developed by Cheeger and Gromov, he would  like to study the minimal volume gap conjecture for complete  aspherical manifolds.  Cao also plans to continue his study on  isoperimetric inequalities on simply-connected riemannian manifolds of  non-positive sectional curvature.

In addition, Cao plans to continue his  study of the sign of the Euler number of compact aspherical manifolds,  especially in the complex case.    This project focuses on the study of global geometric shape of  non-positively curved spaces.  The examples of non-positively curved  spaces include flat tires and surfaces with more than two holes, such  as pretzels.  There are also examples of higher dimensional  non-positively curved spaces.  Our universe can be viewed a  3-dimensional space of zero curvature.

Cao has also been interested in the study of the  shortest closed curves on non-positively curved spaces.  He has  already shown that two such surfaces with possible cusps are isometric  if and only if the data of lengths of all shortest closed curves on  the two surfaces are identical.  The data of lengths of all shortest  closed curves on a closed surface M is called the marked length  spectrum of the space M. The study of marked length spectrum on spaces  with boundaries has a number of applications in modern industry and  geologica l sciences.

For random walk on finite groups, the relation between   the behavior of the walk and the structure of the group is studied. The behavior of random   walk on infinite Cayley graphs and its relation with isoperimetric inequalities are   investigated.
