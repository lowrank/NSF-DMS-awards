These types of surfaces have always been important topics in geometry and general relativity, and have also inspired advances of many other subjects in mathematics and science. Geometric Variational Theory is the major method for proving the existence of these types of surfaces. In this research program, the PI will conduct a number of research projects on the existence of minimal, CMC, and PMC surfaces by further advancing Geometric Variational Theory. This research program also includes support for educational activities. The PI will develop new curricula for graduate research topic courses, recruit and mentor Ph. D. students and postdocs, and direct advanced undergraduate students for honors theses. The PI will also organize a summer workshop for graduate students and junior postdocs on topics related to this research program. The goal is to promote early career researchers and encourage collaborations.<br/><br/>In the first subject, the PI will explore important applications of the recent resolution of the Multiplicity One Conjecture. In particular, the PI will investigate new ergodic properties of minimal surfaces, and the Multiplicity One Conjecture in the Simon-Smith setting and the free boundary setting.  In the second subject, the PI will continue the research on Geometric Variational Theory with Lagrange multipliers. The PI anticipates to prove topological bounds for the min-max CMC surfaces in three manifolds, as well as to prove the existence of multiple CMC surfaces. PI also intends to establish the general existence theory for capillary surfaces. In the last subject, the PI will investigate existence problems and applications for minimal surfaces in singular and noncompact spaces via approximations using the free boundary min-max theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its central objects are the gauge fields appearing in the theory of nuclear forces discovered by C.-N. Yang and R. Mills in 1954, which were already familiar to mathematicians. The Yang-Mills field equations have subsequently had an enormous influence in geometry, notably through Donaldson's work on four-dimensional exotic smooth structures. Yang-Mills flow is a natural evolution process designed to solve the Yang-Mills equations, much as Hamilton's Ricci flow does for the Einstein equations. The goal of this research is to pursue novel applications to mathematical gauge theory by refining and extending the PI's results on the analytic behavior of Yang-Mills flow. <br/><br/>In dimension four, it remains to establish the uniqueness of the infinite-time Uhlenbeck limit together with the position of the bubbling points, which requires carrying out the well-known convergence technique due to Leon Simon in the presence of singularities. There are two main directions for applying the flow within 4-dimensional gauge theory: the first is to non-minimal solutions of the Yang-Mills equations on the 4-sphere, where the analogue of the Willmore conjecture (proved by Marques and Neves in 2012) is still unknown. The second is to the Atiyah-Jones conjecture on the stable topology of instanton moduli spaces on the 4-sphere or a K3 surface. The simpler case of the Yang-Mills functional over 3-manifolds is also largely unexplored. Lastly, the PI intends to develop Yang-Mills flow as a tool within the Donaldson-Thomas program for gauge theory on higher-dimensional manifolds with special holonomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are abstract mathematical objects designed to model the universe we live in.  The term locally homogeneous refers to the presence of a high degree of local symmetry which is captured by a Lie group called the (local) symmetry group.  It is this symmetry group which governs the geometry, in the following sense: the meaningful quantities we can measure in a geometric manifold (e.g. lengths or angles) are exactly those which are invariant under the symmetry group.  There are many different possible symmetry groups which lead to different types of geometric manifolds useful in many contexts across mathematics and physics.  There can also be many different geometric manifolds with the same local symmetry group. These all have the same local properties, but can look very different at large scales. The space of all such possibilities is called a moduli space; it is a topological space whose points are the possible geometric manifolds of a certain type and whose topology organizes those geometric manifolds into families whose features vary continuously. While the precise features (e.g. shape, size, etc.) of our universe is a question for empirical physics, a moduli space is the mathematical answer to the question of what possible features could the universe have.  The research component of this project studies geometric manifolds of many types, with focus on flat affine geometry, real projective geometry, and constant curvature pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These geometries have just the right amount of symmetry to allow for large interesting moduli spaces with mysterious but tractable behavior. Core elements of the educational component include training Ph.D. students, a new Texas Experimental Geometry Lab for undergraduate research, and the Texas Winter Workshop on Geometric Structures for early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in the PI's research program is that geometric manifolds of one type may be fruitfully studied by deforming, or transitioning, to a different type of geometry.  For example, the PI?s work studying Margulis spacetimes as geometric limits of anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, has yielded many results about the geometry, topology, and deformation theory of these affine Lorentzian three-manifolds. The PI will develop new tools, following the geometric limit point of view, for new affine geometry contexts in higher dimensions, in order to address questions surrounding important open problems such as the Auslander Conjecture. The PI will also pursue a broad program to study convex real projective structures on manifolds. One focus is to identify which three-manifolds admit such structures and to describe the moduli spaces, with applications to questions in low-dimensional topology. In a more general context, the PI will conduct a thorough investigation of a new notion of convex cocompactness in real projective geometry, generalizing the well-studied notion from the Kleinian groups setting. Educational goals of this project center on expanding and vertically integrating the research training program in Geometric Structures at UT Austin being developed by the PI. The Texas Experimental Geometry Lab (TXGL) will introduce undergraduates at UT Austin to research in geometry, topology, and/or dynamics through computational and experimental projects. TXGL will also provide opportunities for Ph.D. students and post-docs to gain experience mentoring and teaching undergraduates outside the traditional classroom setting. In addition, TXGL will produce visualizations that illustrate concepts from current mathematics research. The Texas Winter Workshops in Geometric Structures will bring together small groups of early career mathematicians in order to learn an emerging new topic at the intersection of different (but related) mathematical fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These activities are designed to foster a rich educational environment for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs at UT by increasing introductory research opportunities for undergraduates and research-level training for graduate students. The overall goals of this initiative are to increase the number of math majors going to top-tier graduate schools, increase the number of Ph.D.s obtaining top-tier postdocs, improve the career placement of postdoctoral fellows after their time at UT, and increase the number of women and minorities pursuing advanced degrees and careers in mathematics research and education.<br/><br/>The UTGD is led by seven faculty members at UT Austin. The group brings a wealth of different viewpoints and motivations together, from low-dimensional topology and geometry, to amenability, representation theory, random walks and ergodic theory. Building on a departmental Group Theory and Dynamics Seminar that has run for the past five years, the emphasis and resources of the grant will bring together expertise in the many areas represented by the research group while providing an arena for new mathematics and for the training of new mathematicians. To increase the number of graduate students entering into fields involving higher mathematics, UTGD will provide a summer Directed Reading Program (DRP) designed to prepare undergraduates for graduate school. UTGD will create a course, Experimental Mathematics, and enhance another, Discrete Math, to help prepare students for research. To improve the placement of graduating UT Ph.D.s, this award will enhance the UT graduate program by providing graduate fellowships/traineeships and travel funds and support for graduate mini-Schools and a Groups and Dynamics junior seminar. To build the departmental activity centered around Groups and Dynamics, this award will add four postdoctoral positions and provide visitors to work with postdocs, graduate students, and faculty. In the use of these resources, the management team will actively seek to increase the proportion of members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. The grant also proposes a number of ways to impact mathematics outside the department. The materials resulting from any of the projects will be made available through a dedicated website. The mini-Schools will draw from graduate students nationwide; the undergraduate  conference, and the summer DRP will draw broadly from Texas schools. The Julia Robinson Math Festival will bring engaging and new mathematical experiences to K-12 students in the Austin area. The activities with the Math Teachers' Circle will create a stronger working relationship between the faculty and students of the math department and local K-12 teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the PI and his collaborators have recently obtained surprising results for torus representations with connected isotropy groups. The proofs use only elementary representation theory. In particular, they do not involve curvature assumptions and might therefore have wider applications in other areas of geometry.

Contact structures are the underlying geometric structures reigning the behaviour of light wavefronts in semiclassical ray optics, the evolution of thermodynamical systems and, in general, the study of real-valued functions and their first-order variations. In conjunction with its classical applications to control theory and Hamiltonian dynamics, contact topology has also recently found surprising applications to fluid mechanics and chemistry, including the study of Cholesteric Liquid Crystals. This project aims at providing an understanding of these contact structures through the manipulation of Legendrian wavefronts. These wavefronts are geometric in nature and part of this project aims at systematically describing efficient algorithms to manipulate these fronts. This will significantly enhance our ability to qualitatively study many dynamical systems in terms of the combinatorics of front diagrams. Phrasing problems in terms of front diagrams allows us to bring the strength of the theory of singularities into the study of contact structures. Thus, classical questions such as the stable behaviour of a given Hamiltonian system, the number of periodic orbits and the presence of surfaces of section will potentially be answered through the front-end development perspective offered by the combinatorics of front diagrams.<br/><br/>In technical terms, this project shall be studying the classification of codimension-2 contact submanifolds and developing the study of Legendrian Kirby Calculus and Weinstein structures in all higher dimensions. The project addresses existence and non-uniqueness questions in higher-dimensional contact knot theory, the construction and manipulation of Weinstein handlebodies and their higher-dimensional Legendrian wavefronts. The project includes new applications of these goals to complex geometry, through the study of Stein structures, mathematical physics, including applications to Homological Mirror Symmetry, and singularity theory. The techniques proposed in this project will also have immediate applications to the computation of Floer-theoretic invariants in higher-dimensional symplectic topology and the study of Lagrangian fillings and the wrapped Fukaya category.  The central tools in the project combine higher-dimensional geometric topology, the theory of h-principles and Legendrian invariants. The project includes a central conjecture on the classification of Lagrangian fillings for algebraic Legendrian links and an existence and uniqueness h-principle for higher-dimensional contact submanifolds. The techniques to be employed in the study of these conjectures include explicit constructions obtained via the manipulation of Legendrian fronts and wrinkled singularities, and the use of pseudo-holomorphic curves in order to compute their contact invariants. In addition, the project will also incorporate the development of invariants for higher-dimensional contact knots and the use of microlocal sheaf theory as a guiding connection to the theory of cluster algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The laws of nature are often expressed as differential equations and these fall into several broad categories.  The classical heat equation is one prototype; it describes the evolution of temperature in space over time. This and similar equations play a central role in diverse fields, such as physics, economics, information theory, engineering and mathematics.  One of the fundamental principles of the heat equation is diffusion: heat spreads out over time as the temperature becomes more and more constant.  In the classical heat equation, the heat particles move independently and do not interact. When the particles interact with each other, then the situation becomes much more complicated and the evolution is governed by a nonlinear partial differential equation.  This is seen in many geometric problems, such as the evolution of interfaces where the governing principle is a nonlinear version of the heat equation. The equations describing the evolution of interfaces is known as mean curvature flow; it was initially studied in material science and now plays a role in many areas of science, engineering and mathematics.  In addition to the research component of this proposal the project also will also train students: the PI is currently advising several PhD students as well as working with an advanced undergraduate student.  The PI is writing books on research topics of current interest based on graduate courses (on the heat equation and on the mean curvature flow) with his colleague Toby Colding.  The PI serves on the editorial board of eight highly regarded mathematics journals, including the Annals of Mathematics.  The PI is also working on curriculum reform at his home institution, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>The project attacks fundamental questions on geometric flows, including properties of singularities and dynamical properties of the flow.  In mean curvature flow (MCF), a sub-manifold evolves over time to decrease its area as efficiently as possible, pulling itself tight.  Over time, the non-linearity dominates and singularities develop.  The key is to understand these singularities.  Most of the progress has been for hyper-surfaces where the flow can be expressed as a single equation.  In higher co-dimension, the flow is a complicated system of interacting equations and much less is known.  This project focuses on fundamental questions in higher co-dimension MCF: <br/>1. Which singularities are generic and which can be perturbed away?<br/>2. What are the dynamics of the flow near a singularity?<br/>3. What does the flow look like near a singularity?  Is the blow up unique?<br/>4. When are singularities isolated?<br/>These are absolutely fundamental questions and progress will have significant implications.  One of the key tools is the subtle interplay between function theory and geometry.  Many of the techniques developed apply to a broader class of systems, including Ricci flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cartographers construct maps to reveal interesting spacial information about a geographical region.  In a similar way, mathematicians construct maps between geometric spaces to discover interesting features of those spaces.  Here, by a geometric space, we mean a space equipped with notions of angles, distances, areas, etc.  They include Euclidean spaces which are often used to model our everyday physical world or non-Euclidean or Riemannian spaces which can be used as a large scale model of our universe.  This award provides funding to study special maps between geometric spaces called harmonic maps that minimize a certain notion of energy.  By analyzing harmonic maps, the PI aims to uncover properties of important geometric spaces that would lead to a greater understanding of the natural world.  The mathematical theory of harmonic maps has been applied in diverse fields such as medicine (for example, in medical imaging) and computer science (for example, in computer vision), and has further potential applications aiding in the scientific progress and welfare of our society. The project also has an educational component and supports diversity by teaching and advising graduate students, post-doc and early career mathematicians especially those who are underrepresented in the STEM fields.   <br/><br/>The project focuses on harmonic maps in spaces with an upper curvature bound. A harmonic map between Riemannian manifolds is a solution to a certain system of elliptic partial differential equations (harmonic map equations) and is also a solution to a variational problem involving the Dirichlet energy. Since the emergence of modern geometric analysis as a core mathematical discipline, the harmonic map theory has been at the forefront of the field and important applications continue to be found.  A more recent development is the study of harmonic maps into complete metric spaces satisfying an upper curvature bound. The goal of this project is to develop this theory in order to apply it to solve rigidity problems, to understand the structure of surface fibration over Kahler manifolds and projective varieties, and to study quasiconformal maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among its profound implications and wide applications, the theory of gravity successfully describes the shape of our universe and predicts celestial objects that were not known to exist, such as black holes. Over the past few decades, remarkable progress using advanced techniques in geometry and analysis has been made to resolve fundamental questions in general relativity, which has also led to the astonishing realization that some celestial objects are governed by the same mathematical principles as daily life objects, such as soap films. This project employs frontier developments in mathematics to investigate those interconnections and to further advance our understanding on the geometric structures of mathematical models of our universe. The project also incorporates mentoring and educational activities to promote geometry, analysis, and their interrelations with other STEM disciplines, to broader communities and to the society.<br/> <br/>Because of rapid advancement in geometric analysis in recent years, several longstanding questions in general relativity have been largely resolved. A prominent example is the resolution to the positive mass conjecture, including recent work on the spacetime positive mass theorem. At the same time, those resolutions in general relativity have motivated the development of new and unexpected techniques in geometry and analysis. The goal of this project is to interconnect general relativity with neighboring areas in geometry and analysis where some of innovative techniques can be further developed and applied. The scope of the project is to analyze curvature and geometric structure of initial data sets and their spacetime development, arising from mass minimization problems related to quasi-local mass, to investigate scalar curvature problems for compact manifolds and classification of static manifolds, and to characterize Einstein manifolds from the aspect of hyperbolic and conformal geometry. The project develops new ideas and techniques from differential geometry, analysis, partial differential equations, functional analysis, and calculus of variations to tackle fundamental questions in mathematical relativity and in the neighboring areas of geometry and analysis and is anticipated to have impact in other areas of mathematics and in theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the large scale behavior of the universe is determined by Einstein's theory of general relativity, while the small scale behavior is dictated by quantum mechanics.  A prominent goal of theoretical physics has been to find a mathematical description of the universe which unites these large and small scale descriptions.  This work has led to the discovery of string theory, and a vast array of beautiful and intricate mathematical structures and equations.  The equations of string theory are difficult and complicated, and are expected to connect radically different branches of mathematics and physics. Understanding these equations, and the structure they contain, is the primary goal of these education and research projects.  This research agenda aims to understand mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena in string theories ranging from particle formation and decay to the emergence of gravity in ""holographic"" string theories.  The education plans aim to provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in learning and research projects related to the research program.  Planned activities include sponsored research projects for undergraduates, a bi-annual weekend conference for graduate students, and a two week summer program, including a week long summer school and graduate students and advanced undergraduates vertically integrated with existing summer research programs.<br/><br/>These projects aim to investigate several problems in geometry which are inspired by string theory, and which involve techniques from differential equations, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. The first project involves studying two equations arising in mirror symmetry: the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation, and the special Lagrangian equation.  The goal is to develop a theory that relates the study of these equations to structures in algebraic geometry, using an infinite dimensional version of classical geometric invariant theory.  These equations present exciting new mathematical challenges ranging from the analysis of fully nonlinear systems to understanding the algebraic structure encoded in certain singular geometric objects, in analogy with connections between multiplier ideals and singular, positively curved metric on holomorphic line bundles.  As a result, this project will involve developing new ideas in partial differential equations, as well as differential and algebraic geometry.   These ideas are to be tested in a variety of simplified models, which will lead to the resolution of several open problems in Kahler geometry.  Another line of work will study the phenomenon of emergent gravity in string theory, and in particular the AdS/CFT conjecture, and connection with combinatorial facets of AdS/CFT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A shape with one hole (a torus) could look like an inner tube, a tire, or a hula hoop. The collection of all possible geometries is known as a moduli space, and these spaces occur over and over again in fundamental physical questions. This NSF award provides funding for a project to study questions of what typical, or random, surfaces look like, from the point of view of understanding families of curves on these surfaces.

A prime example is the theory of General Relativity, which was invented to make gravity compatible with Special Relativity. The Einstein equations are a system of evolution equations that describe the spacetime geometry and curvature, which arise in specific situations. Like many other geometric/physical equations the Einstein equations are nonlinear and thus can produce solutions that develop very high curvature regions and lead to mathematical singularities, which are expected to be black holes. Singularities also arise in surfaces that minimize volume, so called minimal surfaces. Such minimizing surfaces in a curved spacetime are intimately connected with the geometric structure of the spacetime, and their existence and properties reflect properties of the spacetime such as the energy distribution of the gravitational field, and the prediction of gravitational collapse to a black hole. A major goal of this project is to better understand the stability properties of such singularities, especially those that can arise in volume minimizing surfaces in spacetime. When we study curved geometries, there are naturally associated numbers that are the fundamental frequencies with which such a geometry would vibrate if it were thought of as an idealized drumhead. This sequence of numbers is called the spectrum. A second goal of this project is to understand the special geometries that have the largest fundamental frequencies per unit volume.  The project also includes significant training of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows.  The PI also plans to deliver outreach lectures in geometry.<br/><br/>The focus of this research is in the areas of differential geometry, general relativity, and partial differential equations. In work that is motivated both by differential geometry and general relativity the PI will study the singularities, which may form in higher dimensional volume minimizing hypersurfaces. This issue comes up in the study of manifolds of positive scalar curvature and the related positive mass theorem of general relativity. He will study the question of whether singularities can be perturbed away by a small perturbation of the boundary or the ambient metric. He poses some explicit test cases for this question. The second main theme is the study and comparison of three quasi-local masses that have arisen in general relativity. These are the Hawking, Bartnik, and Brown-York masses. Several questions are posed concerning the relative sizes of these quantities. The connections between the Brown-York mass and recent polyhedral comparison theorems will be investigated with a suggestion for solidifying the connections between the two. The third main theme of his research in geometry will be the study of spectral geometry and related questions on minimal submanifolds. The PI has recently analyzed sharp bounds on the high Steklov eigenvalues of the disk and will extend that study to the next simplest cases of the annulus and the Mobius band.

Complex manifolds are higher-dimensional surfaces that are defined using the complex numbers. Recently, there has been significant progress in the study of ""metrics"" on complex manifolds, objects that endow these spaces with a shape or more precisely, curvature. The study of these metrics lies at the nexus of complex geometry and geometric analysis. The aim of this conference is to gather together experts working in these two fields to discuss these new and exciting developments. Even though lately there have been many conferences in complex geometry, none have really been organised to address these recent discoveries. This conference serves to fulfill this necessity. In doing so, it will promote collaboration across many areas of the aforementioned fields of complex geometry and geometric analysis. The latest breakthroughs in these two fields will be presented to a new generation of mathematicians, with a particular emphasis on women and those from minority groups. The conference will provide a forum for senior mathematicians to interact with graduate students through the organisation of an optional poster presentation for graduate students which will take place in a non-intimidating and relaxed environment. Ample opportunity will also be provided to women speakers to present their research, with at least one talk per day scheduled for a female speaker. Moreover, the conference will provide a platform for postdocs and junior researchers to present their work. Participants will be brought up-to-date with all of the current developments in the field and will be presented with new avenues of research in the enticing environment that Miami provides in the Winter.<br/> <br/>More specifically, the Conference on Special Metrics in Complex Geometry will concentrate on the interplay between complex geometry and geometric analysis, with an emphasis being given to equations arising in the construction of hermitian and Kahler metrics with prescribed curvature properties, for example, the complex Monge-Ampere equation in Kahler geometry. These equations are among the most important appearing in geometric analysis and understanding their structure and the techniques involved in their solution are paramount for further progress in the field. Recent breakthroughs include, among others, the independent construction of non-flat Ricci-flat Kahler metrics with maximal volume growth on complex affine space of dimensions three and greater by Li, Conlon-Rochon, and Szekelyhidi, the construction of new examples of gradient expanding and steady Kahler-Ricci solitons by Conlon-Deruelle and Biquard-Macbeth respectively, the solution by Chen-Cheng of a major conjecture of Tian stating the equivalence between the existence of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics on a compact Kahler manifold and the properness of Mabuchi's K-energy, and the recent families of Ricci-flat Kahler metrics exhibited by Hein-Sun-Viaclovsky-Zhang on K3 surfaces which collapse to an interval with Tian-Yau and Taub-NUT metrics occurring as bubbles.

Two key notions in differential geometry, besides ""length"" and ""angle,"" are: ""minimal surfaces,"" which generalize the concept of a straight line, and ""curvature,"" which measures how a surface is bent. The early development of differential geometry is partly attributable to physics. In the early 20th century, Einstein formulated a geometric theory of gravitation, general relativity, asserting that we live in a curved four-dimensional world (""spacetime"") where energy and mass are manifestations of the curvature of spacetime, and minimal surfaces are indicative of black hole boundaries. Nowadays, differential geometry and minimal surfaces are at the heart of several physical theories and active mathematical research directions. The principal investigator (PI) will study problems regarding minimal surfaces that are motivated by general relativity and by the van der Walls--Cahn--Hilliard theory of phase transitions for multicomponent alloy systems. This project will also support the proposer's efforts to promote student learning, inclusion, and training through summer schools, workshops, and conferences, as well as via expository articles and notes.<br/><br/>This project spans three related active research areas of minimal surface theory in differential geometry. First, the PI will investigate the construction of minimal surfaces as limiting min-max phase transitions. This construction has been recently shown to exhibit certain desirable stability properties that led to the proof of the ""multiplicity one min-max conjecture"" in three dimensions by the PI and Chodosh. The PI will continue this program, to produce surfaces with different curvatures and in different dimensions, as well as to better understand geometric implications of stable phase transitions. Second, as a step toward understanding limits of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, the PI will study smooth and non-smooth three- and four-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature via the inherent bending effects of their embedded minimal surfaces. Third, the PI will apply this study of bending effects of minimal surfaces to investigate conjectured relationships between different mass notions in general relativity, where time-symmetric initial data sets are precisely manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such metrics solve partial differential equations, called curvature equations, where singularities can be viewed as boundary data.

Fundamental ideas and concepts such as information, entropy, chaos and fractals have had a profound impact on our understanding of the world.  Dynamical systems and ergodic theory have developed superb tools, and have a strong impact on the sciences and engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for example has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology.  Geometry is a highly developed, ancient yet superbly active field in mathematics.  It studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces. Surveying the land for his principality, Gauss also developed the fundamental notions of geodesics and curvature, laying the groundwork for modern differential geometry.  It has close links with physics and applied areas like computer vision.  Geometry and dynamics are closely connected.  Indeed, important dynamical systems such as the geodesic flow come from geometry, and vice versa one can use geometric tools to study dynamics.  One main goal of this project studies symmetries of dynamical systems, especially when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other.  The quest is to study these systems via unexpected symmetries.  Important examples arise from geometry when the space contains many flat subspaces.  Finally group theory gets introduced in both dynamics and geometry via the group of symmetries of a geometry or dynamical situation.  The principal investigator will continue training a new generation of researchers and mathematicians, and students at all levels in their mathematical endeavor.  This project includes support for research training opportunities for graduate students and summer research experiences for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This project will investigate rigidity phenomena in geometry and dynamics, especially actions of higher rank abelian and semi-simple Lie groups and their lattices.

As higher rank semisimple Lie groups and their lattices contain higher rank abelian groups, the classification and rigidity problems for the abelian and semi-simple cases are closely related, with abundant cross fertilization.  The goal is the classification of such actions.  Closely related are the study of automorphism groups of geometric structures.  Investigations in geometry will address higher rank Riemannian manifolds and their classification, introducing novel methods.  The dynamics of geodesic and frame flows will also be studied, with investigations of discrete subgroups of Lie groups for rank rigidity and measure properties.  Besides establishing new results, the principal investigator also strives to find and introduce novel methods for investigating these problems which will lend themselves to applications in other areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among dynamical systems, area-preserving maps are both ubiquitous and poorly understood. This project investigates area-preserving maps and their geometry on a class of spaces called K3 surfaces. Such dynamical systems serve as basic models for a broad class of situations and intertwine unpredictability (chaos) with tame, predictable behavior. Systems exhibiting only unpredictability, as well as systems exhibiting only tame behavior, are by now well-studied and the goal of this project is to understand the boundary and coexistence of these two extremes.<br/><br/>In one direction, the PI will study the dynamics in moduli spaces of K3 surfaces. Moduli spaces parametrize all possible objects of a given type and are fundamental tools in mathematics and theoretical physics. Dynamics in moduli spaces describes how the geometry of the surface changes and, consequently, leads to an understanding of the dynamics on the surface itself. Part of the research program is based on earlier developments in homogeneous and Teichmller dynamics, following analogies between K3 and Riemann surfaces. The geometry of K3 surfaces is controlled by Ricci-flat metrics, which are solutions to Monge-Ampre partial differential equations. The PI will relate these equations to more dynamical invariants, such as Lyapunov exponents and entropy.

These moduli spaces have immediate applications in enumerative geometry, Mirror Symmetry, construction of Fukaya categories, and other active areas of research in symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and string theory. In collaboration with M. McLean and A. Zinger, the PI introduced topological notions of normal crossing symplectic divisor and variety. They have constructed tools such as regularizations and logarithmic tangent bundle for working with such objects. Recently, the PI developed a novel compactification and a deformation theory based on the logarithmic tangent bundle. He will use this setup to work on the remaining steps of the construction. The main project is to define Gromov-Witten invariants relative to an arbitrary normal crossing divisor.

The mathematical part aims to advance our understanding of the shapes that surfaces present when they are most efficiently navigating their environment. Of course, the notion of efficient depends on the context, so the project considers a number of settings, expecting to find both differences and similarities in the optimal shapes as the criteria for ""best shape"" are changed.  In terms of education, the setting is that nation will need about a million more engineers in the coming decade than we expect the pipeline, as it is currently configured, to produce. At the same time, students from less well-resourced high schools, even if smart and hard-working and interested in a career in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, leave those STEM fields at an alarming rate, as they have trouble transitioning from high school to college. A program led by the PI has achieved notable success in cutting the attrition from STEM students of high potential but less-than-optimal preparation: the grant will help grow, sustain, develop and disseminate information about this comprehensive holistic approach to retention of students in STEM. <br/> <br/>The project will investigate, via harmonic maps, the asymptotic holonomy of surface group representations in the Hitchin component of several low rank Lie groups. The equivariant harmonic maps from surfaces to the associated symmetric spaces have holomorphic invariants, the geometric topology of which can predict the holonomy of the representation, up to a decaying error.  At the same time, the error estimates are strong enough to suggest a unity of approaches: a rescaling of the range and the maps produces a harmonic map to a building, while an apparently different building may be constructed algebraically via an associated real closed field and a valuation. Other projects include finding a new basic minimal surface in three-space through moduli space techniques, a new type of uniformized metric through geometric analytic techniques, and a refinement of a classical circle-packing result on surfaces.

For instance, for a square the set of successive rotations by 90 degrees in the plane is a collection of symmetries and yields a group of size 4.  One useful way of describing a group is via what is known as a presentation, with generators and relations between the generators completely describing the group.  For example, the collection of all integers is an infinite group that is generated by a single element, namely the integer 1.  If a group has a finite presentation (with a finite number of generators and a finite number of relations) then it is easier to understand, and easier to solve problems about that group.  In addition, a group is called coherent if it enjoys the stronger property that every finitely generated subgroup is finitely presented.  Many of the best understood groups are coherent: free groups, surface groups, and 3-manifold groups are all coherent.  This project aims to understand when groups are coherent and to find geometric indicators of subgroups that are witnesses to incoherence.  This project advances the field by investigating geometrically wild subgroups of seemingly well-behaved groups, which can be difficult to find.  The project includes work in education, and the PI is helping to organize conferences and schools that enhance the training of the next generation. <br/><br/>The PI plans to investigate the coherence of several interesting classes of groups, including groups that are expected to be coherent and groups which are expected to be incoherent.  This project addresses fundamental and difficult problems about incoherence and the geometry of subgroups.  One of the projects is a key step to a well-known conjecture that hyperbolic groups with Sierpinski carpet boundary are virtually Kleinian.  Another is a newer conjecture, that groups which act geometrically on the product of two trees are incoherent.  Solving these conjectures will shed substantial light on understanding when a group is the fundamental group of a 3-manifold, and also on the intricate subgroup structure of important classes of groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since antiquity, mathematicians have studied surfaces such as spheres, ellipsoids, paraboloids and hyperboloids in three-dimensional Euclidean space. These surfaces, familiar to the Greeks, can all be described in Cartesian geometry by equations of the second degree. Modern algebraic geometry, as developed primarily in the 20th and 21st centuries, provides tools to study surfaces defined by equations of higher degree. While a single equation of degree five (for example) may define a smooth surface in three-space, a pair of such equations will define a pair of surfaces, and the intersection of the two surfaces will be a curve in space. The project will seek to answer long-standing questions about the possible singularities of a curve arising in this way, using tools that first arose in the description of the fundamental forces of nature at the atomic and nuclear scale. These same tools will also be used in addressing questions about network flows. At the same time, the project will train graduate students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.<br/><br/>The project activity will be in the following specific areas. In collaboration with T. S. Mrowka, the PI will develop properties of an instanton homology for spatial trivalent graphs and for knots in general three-manifolds. In particular, tools will be developed that will enable the calculation of instanton homology more generally than is currently possible. This instanton homology was constructed in previous work using a gauge theory related to representations of the fundamental group of complement of the knot or graph in the group of rotations, SO(3). When defined using a local coefficient system, instanton homology of knots and links yields new constraints on the topology of embedded surfaces whose boundary is a given knot or link. Specifically, it yields information about the possible genus of such surfaces and the number of their singularities. The final goal is to develop these tools to the point where they will answer long-standing questions in algebraic geometry concerning the topology of algebraic curves. For example, the PI will seek a negative answer to the question of whether two smooth quintic surfaces can intersect in an irreducible singular curve of genus zero. The goal of developing tools for the calculation of instanton homology will be applicable also to another goal, which is to use instanton homology to provide a new proof of the four-color theorem, which is the statement that the regions of any planar map can be colored using only four colors. The four-color theorem has been proved previously only with computer assistance, and it is hoped that this project might therefore lead the way to the first human-readable proof.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a satellite event to the 8th European Congress of Mathematics:  https://www.8ecm.si/program/satellite-events. The venue of the conference, SISSA is one of the leading European research universities, situated in Trieste, which is one of the most important scientific hubs in Italy.  The meeting will focus on the most recent developments at the crossroads of geometry and dynamical systems, with a special focus on integrable systems and applications to mathematical physics. The notion of integrable system in classical mechanics dates back to Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) and has an illustrious and long history. The modern resurgence of activity was initiated  by the analysis of soliton solutions of nonlinear wave equations like the Korteweg deVries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The conference aims to bring together both leading mathematicians that have contributed and are contributing to the success and dissemination of methods and ideas originating from integrable systems in all areas of mathematics and physics and also junior researchers and graduate students who should take over the lead in this fascinating field in the near future.<br/><br/>The renewed interest in integrable systems brought along the invention and development of far reaching solution techniques, including the inverse scattering method and the Sato-Segal-Wilson theory of infinite Grassmannians. The notion of integrable systems has since expanded considerably and often refers to a wide range of techniques. The development of techniques and new classes of integrable models has both cross-fertilized and received input from distant areas of mathematics and physics.  There will be two types of presentations: (i) 25-30  plenary talks by leading specialists in the fields of geometry, dynamics, and integrability. (ii) Poster session mostly for young researchers working in the fields, with 10 minutes introductory oral presentation for each of them. The scientific background of the conference is based on relationships between several popular areas of research. Thus, it has a potential to attract young mathematicians,  minorities and women to participate in exciting cross-disciplinary research and look for new applications of their research in other fields of science. The results of this event will be disseminated by the participants from around the world. https://indico.sissa.it/event/41/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI and his collaborators are developing a new method for calculating knot invariants using new tools from particle physics developed over the last decade.

An increasing interest has been devoted to the corresponding geometric variational problems in mathematics. Minimizing the area functional, the simplest anisotropic energy, is one of the most famous examples in this class of problems. It dates back to the work of Lagrange in 1760 and has had a major impact both in physics and in mathematics. Jesse Douglas was awarded the first Fields Medal in 1936 for his results on this topic; yet, a variety of basic questions remain open, especially in the more general anisotropic setting. The goal of this project is to develop new theories and techniques to improve the state of the art of anisotropic geometric variational problems.<br/> <br/>This project aims to increase our understanding of critical points for general elliptic integrands. In contrast to the reach theory of minimal surfaces, i.e., critical points of the area functional, very little is understood in the anisotropic framework. One of the main themes of this project is the existence of anisotropic minimal hypersurfaces in closed Riemannian manifolds. This is a fascinating and central question in geometric analysis, which has been answered for the area functional by Pitts, Schoen, Simon and Yau in the eighties. The investigator will address the more general anisotropic setting, broadening the reach of the min-max theory. This will require a refined analysis of the structure of varifolds, which will find applications also in the construction of geometric flows. Another goal of this project is to study existence and regularity results for energy minimizers of the set-theoretic Plateau problem in general metric spaces. This investigation will be then further refined for size minimizer rectifiable currents. Moreover, the investigator will study the behavior of hypersurfaces with almost constant anisotropic mean curvature. Finally, the stability and regularity conjectures in optimal branched transport will be addressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In practical applications, it is essential to have medium-scale techniques that are neither infinitesimal nor asymptotic.<br/><br/>This research project will focus on 4 areas, (1) Counting and statistical geometry: methods for studying the precise geometry of geodesics open up applications like rational growth, statistical hyperbolicity, and macro Ricci curvature.  (2) Nilpotent geometry: nilpotent groups such as the 3D Heisenberg group are of central interest in geometric analysis, Lie theory, and even the part of control theory that centers on sub-Riemannian geometry. In the 1980s, they also opened up a new vista on geometric group theory, through Gromov's remarkable polynomial growth theorem, which is still being explored for insights.

One can study the properties of the surface by considering the space of all shapes it can have. This space of shapes is called the moduli space of the surface. One example would be if a circle is allowed to change its shape but remain an ellipse, then the moduli space would be described by two numbers, the length of the short axis and the length of the long axis and therefore be two dimensional. Topological surfaces (and higher dimensional objects) can be studied by considering the shape or geometry of its moduli space. One such geometry is the Weil-Petersson geometry which plays an important role in mathematics and physics. This NSF award supports a project with a focus on the Weil-Petersson geometry of a moduli space. In prior work, the PI and collaborators introduced a flow on the moduli space of a surface, called the Weil-Petersson renormalized volume gradient flow. This flow reveals much of the structure of the moduli space of three-dimensional spaces. For a large class of three-dimensional spaces this is a uniformizing flow, flowing any shape to make it as symmetric as possible: in the circle analogy, making the ellipse become a round circle. One of the major directions is to show that this flow is uniformizing for all spaces of a certain type. This work is at the intersection of mathematics and physics and is expected to lead to new connections between the two fields. The project will support a graduate student and allow the PI to disseminate the work through conferences and seminars. <br/><br/>The project focuses on two main areas of research, 1) renormalized volume and its Weil-Petersson gradient flow and 2) the Weil-Petersson geometry of higher Teichmuller spaces. These two areas are relatively new, having developed over the last fifteen years. In 1) the PI plans to use renormalized volume to study the structure of hyperbolic three-manifolds. The renormalized volume of a hyperbolic manifold is closely related to its convex core volume but has nicer analytic properties such as being a smooth function on moduli space. In prior work, the PI and collaborators introduced the Weil-Petersson gradient flow of renormalized volume to study the geometry of the deformation space of convex cocompact hyperbolic structures on a three dimensional manifold. In particular this work showed that when the space is acylindrical then the flowlines are Weil-Petersson quasigeodesics and that the renormalized volume is minimized at the unique structure which has convex core boundary totally geodesic. Furthermore, a surgered version of the flow is a uniformizing flow, flowing every point to the unique structure which has convex core boundary totally geodesic. A major project is to show that in the boundary incompressible case, the flow limits to the conjectured decomposition along its windows and acylindrical pieces. In higher Teichmuller theory the PI and collaborators consider extending the analytic and metric structure of classical Teichmuller theory to geometric representations into higher rank Lie groups. In earlier work, the PI and collaborators introduced a natural extension of the Weil-Petersson metric to higher Teichmuller theory. More recently they have generalized the construction to define extensions based on the simple roots of the associated Lie algebra. The PI will investigate these Weil-Petersson extensions and study their geometric structure. This has already led to a number of rigidity results, related to simple spectral length and the Liouville volume for Hitchin representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A hallmark of abstract mathematics is that the generality of concepts allows them to be applied to many apparently diverse situations. A manifold can describe a physical object, like the two-dimensional surface of an asteroid, or the space of all configurations of a robotic arm. Moving away from physical objects, any data set can be seen as a finite set of points in a manifold, in which case the dimension equals the number of quantities measured, for example height, weight, age, etc in a population. This project focuses on the study of ""symmetry"" of manifolds, which can be finite, like the one exhibited by a butterfly or a starfish, or infinite, such as the rotational symmetry of a round object like a planet. Symmetry leads to a notion of equivalence between points (for example the five tips of a starfish are equivalent), which naturally gives rise to a decomposition, or ""Foliation"", of the manifold into sub-manifolds called ""leaves"", which are sets of points equivalent to each other. Symmetry also yields the notion of ""invariant functions"", meaning functions constant on the leaves. The main goal of this project is to study the interplay between the algebraic study of invariant functions, and the geometric study of the ""leaves"". The PI will continue outreach to high school students, undergraduate research, graduate training, broadening participation activities, and organization of conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this project will explore the interplay between the emerging field of singular Riemannian foliations, and the older fields of Invariant Theory and Submanifold Theory (especially isoparametric and minimal submanifolds).

The principal investigator will also study related questions about the existence of symplectic embeddings; these are mathematical transformations that can be used to relate different dynamical systems to each other.<br/><br/>In order to study these kinds of dynamical questions, mathematical tools will be developed in the theory of embedded contact homology (ECH) of three-manifolds, and other kinds of contact homology in higher dimensions. The foundations of ECH will be extended to the case of Morse-Bott contact forms. ECH of unit cotangent bundles will be studied and related to string topology. Spectral invariants in periodic Floer homology (a variant of ECH) will be developed and used to study whether or not generic area-preserving maps of surfaces have dense periodic orbits. Cobordism maps on ECH will be used to study Lagrangian embeddings in four-manifolds, and to investigate generalizations of the Arnold chord conjecture on the existence of Reeb trajectories with ends on a given Legendrian knot. Nonequivariant and equivariant contact homology will be studied in three and higher dimensions. Symplectic capacities arising from these different kinds of contact homologies will be compared. Combinatorial Reeb dynamics on polytopes will be developed and used to perform computer experiments to test Viterbo's conjecture and other related conjectures about Reeb dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coastlines, clouds, and leaves are examples of such objects that occur in nature. The famous coastline paradox states that since a coastline is so rough at so many different scales, it has no defined length. The PI plans to develop and study new methods to build such multiscale objects and to break them down into easily handled pieces. New ways to decompose objects often lead to great advances in mathematics, where simple problems can have complicated, multiscale solutions. The project?s three-prong approach includes studying ways to break down complex objects, build complex objects out of simple pieces, and to measure multiscale complexity. In addition to the research, the PI will train graduate students and postdocs in the techniques developed by this project through advising, seminars, minicourses, and reading groups and disseminate material on his webpage for public access.<br/><br/>The project aims to study problems in metric geometry, geometric measure theory, and harmonic analysis related to maps and surfaces with multiscale structure, that is, objects like Lipschitz and Holder maps or fractals, that are hard to approximate by affine maps or by planes. One focus is the study of geometric problems that have non-smooth solutions but no smooth solutions, such as the Nash Embedding Theorem. Solutions to these problems often use multiscale or self-similar structure to break rules that smooth maps have to satisfy, and one aim of this project is to understand when and why this phenomenon occurs. Another focus is quantitative and uniform rectifiability. Uniform rectifiability has been a powerful tool for studying singular integrals and geometric measure theory in Euclidean space. Recent work has made it possible to find sharp bounds on the quantitative rectifiability of surfaces in the Heisenberg group, and this project will explore the possibility of extending notions of uniform rectifiability to the Heisenberg group and using them to solve problems in the geometry of Euclidean space and the Heisenberg group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of a groupoid allows for more general symmetries, acting on a collection of objects rather than just a single one. The concept of a Lie groupoid, as well as its infinitesimal counterpart, the notion of a Lie algebroid, have played an increasing important role in various branches of mathematics, as well as its applications. For example, one can now find them in the formulation of dynamics in field theory in High Energy Physics, in various models for populations dynamics in Biology, or in evolutionary dynamics in Game Theory. Over the last two decades, the theory of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids has undergone several exciting developments and this project aims to develop further both foundational aspects and significant new applications of the theory. This project includes collaborations with various researchers in the field working in Europe and South America and the training of 3 PhD students. The PI will be involved in the organization of several international meetings, workshops and summer courses in the field, as well as a weekly seminar at UIUC.<br/><br/>The project is organized into 4 main tasks. The first task continues the PI study of Poisson manifolds of compact type, which are central objects in Poisson Geometry, playing a role analogous to compact Lie algebras in Lie Theory. The second task is dedicated to multiplicity free fibrations, a.k.a. non-commutative integrable systems, and initiates the study of its generic singularities. The third task concerns the study of strict (non-formal) deformation quantization and aims to establish the first known obstructions to the existence of strict deformation quantizations of a Poisson manifold. The fourth task concerns Cartan?s realization problem underlying many classification problems in geometry, namely the ones that can be formulated in terms of (finite dimensional) families of G-structures. It aims to establish a theory of such realization problems, based on Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, as well as to give a complete solution to the classification problem. All these tasks rely heavily on Lie groupoid techniques, many of which have yet to be developed. Some of these ideas extend and expand results and techniques previously developed by the PI and collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such construction problems arise in mathematics, science, engineering, and medicine. Identifying organs and tumors within the human body is one such example. The design of the shapes of radar antennas is another. The Brunn-Minkowski theory is at the heart of one of the core subjects that provides the mathematical and computational tools used in such applications. The core of the Brunn-Minkowski theory concerns the study of  types of geometric measurements (such as the surface area, volume, curvature of its boundary) of an object. Another central area are Minkowski problems, which ask whether an object can be reconstructed from a set of these geometric measurements. The investigators will continue their efforts to expand and enrich both of these central areas. They will also continue their work connecting ideas in information theory with Brunn-Minkowski theory. The work of the investigators has generated interesting questions, some that have still withstood the efforts of the best research mathematicians and other problems that can be explored even by high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The recent discovery of the dual curvature measures has led to new compelling problems to be attacked. One of them is the dual Minkowski problem which requires solving a novel fully nonlinear degenerated partial differential equations with measure data. By combining techniques from geometry and analysis, the Investigators (with various collaborators) have been developing new methods to solve characterization problems for geometric measures that are related to degenerated partial differential equations with measure data. These newly developed techniques (of the Investigators) of obtaining delicate estimates for integrals with respect to measures have led to the discovery (by the Investigators) that ""measure concentration"" is the key phenomenon displayed by solutions to those geometric characterization problems. Continuing these investigations should enable the Investigators to make significant progress on fundamental problems regarding characterizing geometric measures. Affine isoperimetric inequalities have for many years been a central focus of the Investigatoirs' efforts and a number of new directions are to be explored. The study (pioneered by the Investigators) of connections between affine isoperimetric inequalities and sharp affine Sobolev inequalities shows much promise and will be further explored.

A geometric structure on a manifold is a way of measuring quantities that are invariant under a certain group of symmetries, the same way distances and angles do not change under rotations or translations. In many cases, on a fixed manifold, one can consider different geometric structures with the same underlying group of symmetries. The world of possible such structures is the moduli space. One example is the classic Teichmuller space that parametrizes metrics of constant negative curvature on certain two dimensional manifolds. Higher Teichmuller theory studies more general geometric structures on more complicated manifolds and their dynamical properties. This award provides funding for the research that focuses on fundamental questions in higher Teichmuller theory: how can we describe the geometry of these objects starting from the parameters in the moduli space? In particular, can we understand how these structures degenerate when the parameters leave all compact sets in the moduli space? Some numerical experiments related to this research will be carried out as undergraduate research supervised by the PI.<br/><br/>The PI plans to study geometric structures on low-dimensional manifolds with a rank 2 semi-simple Lie group of symmetries, such as anti-de Sitter, convex projective and Lorentzian conformally flat, using techniques from Higgs bundles, harmonic maps and representation theory. More precisely, the PI will study geometric limits of these structures when the parameters leave every compact set in the corresponding moduli spaces, with the aim of finding a (partial) compactification of these moduli spaces and give a geometric interpretation of the boundary points.

The equations of interest came from high energy physics where they were introduced as very symmetric models for elementary particle interactions.  Basic question to address with regards to solutions are these:  Are there finitely many or infinitely many solutions for the specific applications?  In either case, what do the solutions look like?  And what are their implications with regards to four dimensional spaces?  By way of background:  The equations are far too complicated for a computer to solve (let alone to solve by hand).  Because of this, almost all information about the solutions must be obtained via a detailed analysis of the equations themselves.  With regards to questions about four dimensional spaces, the central issue here is to understand the list of possible four dimensional spaces.  This last question is also relevant to physics by virtue of the fact that the observable universe has four dimensions--three spatial dimensions and then the time direction.  Since the equations of interest come from high energy physics theory and are close cousins to others used there and in condensed matter physics, the analysis tools developed in this project may also find applications to questions in these other fields.  There is also an important educational support aspect of this project that is meant to bring graduate students up to speed on the relevant geometry, topology and analysis.<br/><br/>The research in this prject has three primary focus points.  The first concerns the behavior of the solutions to the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of a three-dimensional manifold and the half-line with singular boundary conditions at one end given by a knot in the three-manifold.  The goal for this focus point is to see whether non-convergent sequences of solutions have pathologies that prevent solution counting definitions of knot invariants for knots in the three dimensional manifold.  Two sources of trouble likely arise, one is a novel pathology from the boundary conditions, and the other due to the presence of Z/2 harmonic 1-forms.  The second focus point concerns the algebraic implications of the structure of the solution space for these same Kapustin-Witten equations and for the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of the three-manifold with the line:  Can an algebraic invariant be defined from these spaces given the non-compactness issues and with the novelty of formally zero dimensional solution spaces?  The third focus point concerns the significance of the afore-mentioned Z/2 harmonic 1-forms and, more generally, Z/2 harmonic sections of a spin bundle.  Such Z/2 harmonic sections appear as renormalized limits of sequences of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations on four dimensional manifolds and the multi-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations on manifolds of dimensions three and four.

These symmetries are encoded in an algebraic construction called the fundamental group; this project aims at studying the connections between this group and geometry. Specifically, among hyperbolic manifolds there is a special class called ""arithmetic"" that tend to be the most symmetric and whose fundamental group has strong connections to number theory. This project aims to use new techniques in geometry and dynamics to study the fundamental group of hyperbolic manifolds in an attempt to understand when such a group is arithmetic and the ramifications of arithmeticity (or lack thereof) on the geometry of the associated manifold. Broader impacts of this project include work with undergraduates.<br/><br/>More specifically, the overarching goal of this research project is twofold -- to better understand the classification of hyperbolic manifolds and their geodesic geometry and to build a robust framework for exploring rigidity phenomenon for fundamental groups of finite-volume real, complex, quaternionic, and Cayley hyperbolic manifolds.

This project plans to continue to develop these new techniques with an eye toward geometric applications. Specifically, the project will address the following broad themes: 1) understanding constructions of both low- and high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds and their geodesic submanifolds, 2) further developing a general framework for superrigidity results for rank-1 lattices, and 3) attempting to use recent advances in rank-1 rigidity as a mechanism to understand integrality of complex hyperbolic lattices and arithmeticity of quaternionic and Cayley hyperbolic spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Problems of this nature arise in many engineering/designing problems (such as the designing of antenna reflector) in addition to many other areas out of mathematics (such as economics). Moreover, these problems are well connected with other areas of mathematics, including PDE and functional analysis. Another benefit of these problems is that in various special cases, they are visually understandable and solvable by motivated undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The recently posed dual Minkowski problem and Lp dual Minkowski problem are two Minkowski-type problems that received much attention. The principal investigator, through collaboration, has gained a good understanding of the solutions when one assumes origin-symmetry of the data and the convex body.

The challenge is to identify and solve the proper optimization problem. Another goal is to understand how an optimization problem involving two bodies can help in this setting. The same phenomenon can be observed when one considers the antenna reflector design problem with decay. The Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality is one of the deepest results in convex geometry and emcompasses many isoperimetric inequalities.

On the one hand, this flexibility has led to numerous profound applications; on the other, it creates great intellectual challenges which have occupied mathematicians for more than 40 years.  The proposed research aims to build on successes in the last few years, to address some of the main open problems.  The second part of the project applies ideas from geometry and analysis to study the structure of rough objects, including fractals.  This area has been developing very rapidly in the last 20 years, due to new connections between different parts of mathematics, and  applications to problems from computer science.  The project also involves substantial training of PhD students.<br/><br/>The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation: evolution of surfaces by mean curvature, and Hamilton's Ricci flow.  Evolution by mean curvature has been studied for decades as a natural model for evolving surface interfaces.  Ricci flow describes an evolving geometry, and was used in Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture.  The primary objective of the proposed research on these equations is to study issues related to the formation of singularities in their solutions, including their structure and stability.  The resolution of fundamental conjectures in geometry and topology is an outgrowth of this work.  Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years. Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible, in order to reveal hidden symmetries,  and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist.  This is very useful for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups, and is part of confluence of several research trends over the last 15-20 years.  Another application of similar ideas is to  embedding problems in theoretical computer science: Cheeger, Naor, and the PI were able to substantially improve the previous best known results on the embedding of spaces of negative type, in connection with the quantitative version of the Goemans-Linial conjecture.  This project specifically addresses geometric evolution equations, embedding problems, analysis on metric spaces, and geometric group theory.  The evolution equations in the project are mean curvature flow and Ricci flow. The research in analysis on metric spaces clusters in three areas: (1) bilipschitz embedding problems and related issues, (2) the structure of spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, (3) the structure of boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic spaces. Common themes in all three areas are spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, and rescaling arguments leading to singular limit spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
