More specifically, the investigator will examine complete conformally flat metrics of constant positive scalar curvature on manifolds of dimension greater than two; he will also construct complete surfaces of constant mean curvature surfaces embedded in Euclidean space (CMC surfaces).    Physicists often seek to describe the universe as a Riemannian manifold possessing a certain special type of geometry. The condition of constant positive scalar curvature is an example of such geometry. A conformally flat structure on a manifold is a generalization to higher dimensions of the structure on a surface in which angles are prescribed. Examples of CMC surfaces include soap bubbles. These are surfaces which try to minimize their surface area while keeping a fixed volume of air enclosed."

Specifically, the investigator is to establish the equivalence between Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants for smooth four-manifolds. The investigator is to use the approach first suggested by Pidstrigach and Tyurin, which is based on non-quantum ideas. The tools to be used for implementing the Pidstrigach-Tyurin approach include Taubes's gluing maps and nonabelian monopoles.    Smooth four-dimensional spaces have received a great deal of attention in recent years due to their applications in relativity theory and due to a recent mathematical discovery allowing their coarse classification. It is notable that instantons and monopoles, two major ingredients in the classification of smooth four-manifolds, both were originally introduced by the physicists studying elementary particles."

Techniques to be employed include perturbation theory, global analysis, and Teichmuller theory. One of the aims of this project is to show that the isopectral set of a compact surface is finite for metrics close to constant curvature.    Spectral geometry is concerned with the interaction of differential-geometric properties of a Riemannian manifold (a curved space with a metric) with the spectra of natural differential operators associated with it. The spectrum of an operator often captures various analytic properties of an otherwise intractable differential operator in a discrete and computable manner. Elucidating the geometric content of various spectral data then is the main concern of spectral geometry."

In the past, these meetings have led to new collaborations and new results whose impact grows in significance long after the conference is concluded. The importance of such conferences is heightened in the area of Geometric Analysis because this is a field which cuts across many areas of mathematics, both pure and applied, and thus requires its practitioners to come in frequent contact with a wide variety of ideas and methods.

Manifolds are curved spaces generalizing surfaces in space. Thus an important geometric property of a manifold is its curvature, which is defined locally. It turns out that there are restrictions on the overall shape of the manifold, i.e., its topology, for the manifold to be able to carry certain types of curvatures; conversely, knowing the curvature one can make certain predictions about its global shape."

He is to investigate the global topological property of such embeddings and the relationship between the complex tangency of real submanifolds and the singularity arising from the structure of real submanifolds with respect to the holomorphic volume form on the complex Euclidean space.    Submanifolds are higher dimensional analogs of surfaces in space; complex spaces are generalizations of real spaces based on complex numbers. Real submanifolds in complex spaces are interesting in that they exhibit both real and complex number based characteristics. They also arise as the boundaries of domains of holomorphy, meaning that they bound regions on which a rather special class of complex-valued functions can be defined."

It asserts that the face-centered cubic packing is one of the densest possible packing of spheres.  There is now a well-developed program for proving the conjecture. In fact, it has been known since the 1950's, through the work of L. Fejes Toth, that this problem can be reduced to an optimization problem in a finite number of variables. Over the last two years, the computational methods have been developed to the point that the Kepler conjecture finally appears to be within reach.  The proof will rely heavily on computer calculations.  Linear relaxation techniques will be used to replace the nonlinear optimization problem with a series of linear programming problems.  These linear programming problems tend to involve about a hundred variables and less than two thousand constraints.  Problems of this size are routinely solved by computer. To guarantee the reliability of computer calculations, IEEE/ANSI standards of machine computation, which permit directed rounding in floating-point arithmetic, will be used.  This will be based on methods of interval arithmetic, which give control over the round-off errors that arise in computer calculations.   In a booklet published in 1611, Kepler described the densest known arrangement of spheres.  He asserted that ""the packing will be the tightest possible, so that in no other arrangement could more pellets be stuffed into the same container."" This claim has come to be known as the Kepler conjecture. The Kepler conjecture is the oldest problem in discrete geometry. The problem is notoriously difficult. It has a long and distinguished history. By now, there is a well-developed program for proving the conjecture.  This project will complete a proof of the Kepler conjecture. In addition to the historical importance of the conjecture, the theory of sphere packings has developed as an important mathematical tool in various scientific pursuits, such as error-correc ting codes, experimental design, and quantization problems.  One of the most fundamental questions of this rapidly growing branch of mathematics will be answered.  The solution will make a novel application of linear programming, global optimization, interval arithmetic, and other computer-based technologieq."

The investigator is to continue his work on escapable sets and metric properties of matrices arising in diophantine approximations.    Dynamical systems in the present context deal with how points in a system move  over time, given a set of differential equations (or laws of nature) governing the system.

The first is a systematic development of Lorentz dynamics. A major milestone would be a complete description of the connected Lie groups that admit a nonproper action on a connected Lorentz manifold. In the case of simple Lie groups, there are definitive results due to N. Kowalsky, but the non-semisimple case is, for now, wide open.  The second main goal of the proposal is to extend known rigidity results from geometry to a foliated setting with tangential geometry and with transverse invariant measure. Much work in this direction has been done by many mathematicians, but the procedures used have often been ad hoc in nature, with a different method developed for each individual theorem. The goal here would be to find an approach that would systematize the process and that would give, in some cases, stronger foliated results than were previously possible.  The proposal has two main goals. The first involves understanding the ways in which chaotic dynamics can happen in a space-time setting.  It is a tenet of general relativity that our universe is a space-time manifold and it should therefore be of some interest to know which space-times have a complicated (that is, ""chaotic"") collection of symmetries. The second main goal is to use a combination of some sophisticated dynamical machinery and some sophisticated geometric machinery to understand a collection of mathematical objects called ""foliations.""  These objects relate to dynamical physics, since the set of trajectories of a flow give rise to a foliation. However, in the incarnation that I am using, a foliation carries an enormous amount of structure, making it rich in a mathematical sense, but probably more complicated than what would be studied (currently!) by most scientists outside of mathematics."

In mathematical terms, these invariants relate to various enumerative questions in algebraic geometry. For example, Gromov-Witten invariants of genus zero appear in the so called mirror symmetry phenomenon.    Gromov-Witten invariants originally arose in theoretical physics - they describe a coupling of topological gravity with a model of conformal field theory. They play an important role in the popular 10-dimensional string model of the universe. The string theory model contains six hidden dimensions which form a tightly curved space known as Calabi-Yau manifold; Gromov-Witten invariants can be used to study various mathematical properties of Calabi-Yau manifolds."

One important question to be addressed is the realization of elements in Bloch group by hyperbolic manifolds - a solution to this question has a direct bearing on the K3 rigidity conjecture.    Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are important building blocks of three-dimensional manifolds or curved spaces in general. These are negatively curved spaces generalizing the non-Euclidean plane geometries.

The idea behind the Ricci flow is to vary the given metric - a metric defines the notion of distance on the underlying manifold - over time in a special way and to see how the resulting family of metrics interact with the topology or shape properties of the manifold."

The PIs long range goal for the program is to establish a complete   analytical and probabilistic theory of path and loop spaces over Riemannian manifolds,   whose counterpart in (flat) Euclidean space (finite or infinite dimensional) has been known   for quite some time. Successes in these efforts will contribute significantly towards our   general understanding of nonlinear infinite dimensional spaces. For the analytical part, the   PI will concentrate his research on further developing analytic techniques subsumed under   the name ""Malliavin Calculus."" In particular for the period covered in this proposal, the PI   will spend a substantial amount of his research resources on the equivalence of various   Sobolev norms (the so-called Meyer's equivalent problem) and on the spectral properties   of the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. For the probabilistic part, the PI intends   to launch a detailed study of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process through sample path,   especially the effect of curvature on short-time and long-time behaviors of the process.   The models under study, path and loop spaces over such geometric structures such   as spheres, ellipsoids, and tori, have been used extensively in recent years in the theory of   relativity, quantum physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The Principal Investigator will   study these models by both traditional analytical methods and the more recent methods of   probability theory.  Specifically he will investigate both long-time and short-time behavior   of a specific random process on path and loop spaces in the hope that it will reveal   geometric properties which can be applied by theoretical scientists and engineers in their   respective disciplines."

The focus is on isoperimetric problems and the theory of piecewise-linear minimal surfaces. A basic isoperimetric problem asks for the smallest area surface enclosing a given pair of volumes. The Double Bubble Conjecture asserts that the shape assumed by a compound soap bubble enclosing two regions answers this question. This conjecture was recently solved by the investigator, in collaboration with R. Schlafly, for two equal volumes, but the general case remains an open problem. The piecewise-linear theory of surfaces considers surfaces which are glued together from flat pieces, much like the surfaces constructed in computer graphics.    The problems considered in this project relate to processes in nature which determine the shape of soap bubbles, the erosion of boulders, the melting of ice, crystal growth, flame propagation, image enhancement and the evaporation of puddles. The piecewise-linear theory of surfaces can be applied to the classification, enumeration and algorithmic recognition of various surfaces ."

In their previous work, they obtained many results in dimension 2, and some in dimension 3 and higher. The proposed research concentrates on the covering problems in dimensions 3 and, whenever feasible, in higher dimensions. The common thread linking the various problems is the sphere covering conjecture in 3 dimensions. The following topics are the main subjects of the proposed investigation:  covering space with parallel strings of spheres; covering space with congruent circular cylinders of infinite length; circle covering (of the plane) with a margin; stability properties of sphere coverings.  The topics mentioned above belong to the area of discrete geometry, and some of them, especially those dealing with lattice arrangements, are related to the geometry of numbers. The problems addressed by the investigators have an intuitive flavor and a natural motivation. For instance, the sphere covering problem can be interpreted as searching for the most economical distribution of transmission stations whose ranges are spherical and of equal sizes to cover the whole space, i.e. so that every point is within reach of at least one of the stations. Whenever it is discovered that a certain optimality condition (e.g. minimum density, as in the example of transmission stations distribution) of an arrangement of figures or solids implies some regularity of the arrangement, a powerful tool is provided for computational geometry. Results of this type give a theoretical foundation for finding efficient computational algorithms. The investigators propose to increase their contributions to this important and difficult area of research."

While the ultimate goal of any study in this area is the understanding of the dynamics of physically relevant field theories such as General Relativity and Yang-Mills, valuable insight can be gained by first focusing on wave maps, which is a simpler geometric field theory exhibiting many similarities with the above, and in which many of the difficulties in dealing with those physical theories are present in a more transparent way.  Wave maps (known to physicists as sigma-models) are the hyperbolic analogue of harmonic maps between manifolds, where the domain manifold instead of being Riemannian is Lorentzian.  They thus satisfy a system of semilinear wave equations with a nonlinearity which is quadratic in the gradient.  Some of the problems to be studied are (1) existence of smooth stationary solutions to the equations and their stability under small perturbations, (2) constructing all possible self-similar wave maps of the Minkowski space, (3) investigating the genericity of singularities arising from self-similar solutions, and (4) finding examples of blowup in two space dimensions.  Hyperbolic partial differential equations lie at the heart of mankind's efforts to quantify and understand the evolutionary  phenomena in nature.  From subatomic particles to galactic clusters, every phenomenon known to Man which involves the propagation of signals and disturbances at finite speeds is modeled by a hyperbolic differential equation.  Examples of such phenomena are the production and propagation of  sound waves (acoustics), water waves (hydrodynamics), seismic body and surface waves (elastodynamics), electromagnetic waves (electrodynamics), and gravitational waves (general relativity).  Despite considerable progress in recent years in  the study of nonlinear hyperbolic systems, the basic questions regarding regularity, break-down and large time behavior of their solutions  in more than one space dimension remain largely unanswered.  Progress in this area requires a good understanding of continuum physics and is only possible through rigorous mathematical analysis of a host of simpler problems, each one modeling only a few of the many difficulties present in the actual physical problem.  With such a long-term plan, it is equally important to educate the next generation of scientists who will have the physical and mathematical ability, as well as the courage and enthusiasm, to continue the work being done today.  This requires a serious re-evaluation of the existing mathematics curriculum and the development of new courses dealing specifically with mathematics as it relates to continuum physics at all levels of college and graduate education."

The idea behind this generalization is that Kubota's formula can be derived geometrically from the second Chern class.    Characteristic classes are 'invariant' algebraic objects often used to classify spaces and manifolds or indicate certain 'topological' obstructions. The idea is to encode essential information possessed by a space in algebraic objects that are unchanged under reasonable transformations of the space. They then provide a useful computational tool since algebraic objects often are discrete and/or finite whereas the space under consideration is almost always infinite."

Our principal activity is a weekly series of talks given by local speakers or experts from other colleges and universities.  Some semesters, the seminar will concentrate on a special topic.  Possible topics we will pursue in coming semesters include the Langlands program, toric varieties and mirror symmetry, and real algebraic geometry. The participants in the Valley Geometry Seminar come from Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts.  The purpose of the seminar is to give local mathematicians working in different areas of geometry the chance to speak about their recent work to an audience of sympathetic peers.  Also, by bringing in outside experts, we get to hear about recent developments in geometry.  The seminar is a crucial part of the research atmosphere for the geometers in our area.  Also, we have structured the seminar so that the talks are really useful.  Rather than the usual one-hour lecture, we encourage speakers to give a two-part talk, separated by a short break.  The first part consists of motivations and examples-the seminar members get to see the ""big picture"" of how the topic being discussed fits into the larger framework of contemporary research.  The second part of the talk then gives the technical details, for in mathematics, you not only have to discover something interesting, but you also have to be able to give an airtight proof.  Hence the second part is a necessary complement to the first part of the talk.  We find this format very useful and most of our speakers adopt this format.  Finally, some semesters we concentrate on a specific topic.  This means that some (but not all) of the talks conc ern aspects of the same topic.  In this way we can get some real depth in our understanding of the topic."

Vafa's group has furthered our understanding of the non-perturbative aspects of string theory along several fronts: deriving the Seiberg-Witten results as a low-energy limit of the moduli dependence of the prepotential in string theory; studying D-brane physics and relating the counting of BPS states to topological questions, including instantons on K3; geometrizing the SL(2,Z) invariance of the Type IIB string and postulating a twelve-dimensional theory (``F-theory""), which contains many interesting string dualities; developing a geometric understanding of non-abelian gauge symmetries and confinement in string theory; and describing the Beckenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes in terms of counting states via string theory and string duality. This last result is perhaps the most striking revelation in quantum gravity from string theory.     Yau's group has been instrumental in understanding several aspects of mirror symmetry and string dualities:  interpreting BPS state counting in terms of enumerative geometry; investigating the differential equations of period integrals on Calabi-Yau manifolds; solving the large radius limit problem in general, which is crucial for applying mirror symmetry to enumerative geometry; describing mirror manifolds as the moduli spaces of supersymmetric submanifolds; and classifying K3 fibrations, which are the key to heterotic-Type II duality.

String theory has undergone a revolution during the past year but will languish without fresh mathematical results --- for the many conjectures need to be justified with rigor!  The pace of mathematics needs to quicken in order to accommodate this recent influx of remarkable ideas.  T his is a very exciting time for mathematics, as well.  Hard conjectures abound, with physical reasoning providing guidance for serious investigation.  Likewise, the physics of string theory is hungry for new math. Within these two groups there is  a wealth of intellectual resources.  Mathematics and physics will both greatly benefit from full exploitation of this interdisciplinary collaboration."

In addition, the investigators will research the possible validity of an infinite-dimensional version of Sard's theorem arising in subRiemannian geometry and control theory.  Finally, the investigators propose to compute certain equivariant symplectic cobordism rings relevant to non-Abelian versions of the Duistermaat-Heckman formula and to geometric quantization. The motivating example for the periodic orbit investigations is the dynamics of a particle in magnetic fields, henceforth referred to as magnetodynamics. The horocycle flow on a Riemann surface is an example of such a dynamics. This flow is crucial to the work since it is the basic building block for constructing Hamiltonian systems which have no periodic orbits on bounded energy surfaces. The smallest number of degrees of freedom for which this non-existence phenomenon is known to hold is four. The investigators will construct examples where this number is equal to three. Magnetodynamics was also one of the examples motivating Arnol'd's conjectures concerning lower bounds for the number of periodic orbits. A number of instances of the conjecture are still open in the magnetodynamic case. The investigators plan to answer some of these. The planar three-body equations, after symplectic reduction, becomes an instance of magnetodynamics. The (fictitious) ``reduced'' particle moves on a three-manifold (with a singularity corresponding to triple collisions) whose points represent congruence classes of planar triangles. The general investigations into magnetodynamics should be of help in understanding some of the open problems remaining in ``the three-body problem''. The main goal in this regard is to prove the existence of a closed trajectory representing any given free homotopy class for the reduced space (three-manifold) minus collisions.  The investigators will be studying what motions are possible for various systems. They will be  concentrating primarily on two types of systems, a type involving charges moving in magnetic fields, closely related to the problem of controlling fusion, and a type involving planets or satellites moving according to Newton's laws. Our main interest is in the periodic orbits for these systems. A periodic orbit is a motion which infinitely repeats itself, coming back to its starting point after some fixed period of time. A familiar example is the rising of the sun every morning. The periodic orbits are thought to be the key to understanding the behavior of systems, especially complicated chaotic systems. One of the most surprising recent developments has been the discovery of complicated systems with no periodic orbits. The investigators plan to find more systems with no periodic orbits and to simultaneously look for simple conditions which would guarantee the existence of a certain number of periodic orbits. This would be a significant step towards a general understanding and control of motions of physical systems."

This project is expected to contribute to the understanding of the singularities that arise from Hamiltonian Lie group actions and momentum maps.  One of the goals is to calculate the equivariant index of symplectic quotients and symplectic cross-sections.  A further goal is to construct homology Todd classes for stratified symplectic spaces, with applications to the index theory of manifolds with singularities.   Symplectic geometry is the branch of geometry governing the laws of the classical mechanics of Newton.  Classical mechanics is a quite accurate description of the large-scale behaviour of objects in the physical world.  At submicroscopic scales a more precise description is given by the laws of quantum mechanics.  To link together macroscopic and microscopic behaviour, it is of importance to be able to go back and forth between the two descriptions, and this has generated much activity by physicists and mathematicians in this century.  My project intends to contribute to the quantization of systems that exhibit ``bad'', or singular, features that cannot be treated by conventional means.  Such singularities often arise in the presence of linear, spherical, or more complicated types of symmetry.  Symmetry in a system of physical objects often enables one to predict important features of its future behaviour, and my object is to find out how these features are reflected at the quantum level."

The investigator will study the asymptotic behavior of harmonic maps into negatively curved spaces near prescribed singularities. This study is motivated by, and has applications to, the problem of stationary black holes in general relativity. The PI also proposes to generalize blow-up results for wave maps. Wave maps which develop singularities from regular initial data will be constructed from harmonic maps defined on hyperbolic space. In the area of general relativity, the investigator will continue his work on equilibrium configurations of co-axially rotating charged black holes. A uniqueness theorem is sought independent of the number of black holes present. Also proposed is the study of the topology of the space of initial data for the Einstein equations, and questions related to equilibrium configurations of rotating and nonrotating perfect fluid bodies. Harmonic maps are mappings between Riemannian manifolds  (geometrical spaces) which satisfy nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations.  They were first introduced on two dimensional domains by C. B. Morrey Jr. in the 1950's in his study of Plateau's Problem in Riemannian manifolds: to find a soap film which spans a given contour. Harmonic maps have since found numerous applications in physics, geometry, and other fields. Harmonic maps with prescribed singularities will be used in this project to model equilibrium configurations of co-axially rotating charged black holes. Understanding these configurations is an important step in the future study of the evolution equations. Wave maps are the dynamical counterparts of harmonic maps. They satisfy nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. These equations have been studied by many researchers as a first step in a program to understand more complex evolution equations of classical field theory such as the Einstein field equations of general rel ativity. The Einstein field equations model the large scale evolution of spacetime. One of the interesting features of this class of nonlinear evolution equations is that solutions starting from regular data may sometimes yield blow-up after a finite time laps, leading to singularities. The investigator will construct and study wave maps with such singularities. Another problem, with applications to astrophysics, to be addressed in this project will be to construct a model for relativistic dense rotating stars in equilibrium."

On the one hand, the principal investigator is interested in the well known inverse problem, can one hear the shape of a drum?  Recent advances in the analysis of the spectral invariants known as wave trace invariants allow one to 'hear' much more than has been previously possible, especially in the case of certain real analytic metrics with completely integrable geodesic flow.  The main tool here is the construction and analysis of quantum analogues of the Birkhoff normal forms for a Hamiltonian flow near a periodic orbit or invariant torus. On the other hand, the principal investigator is also interested in problems of mathematical physics having to do with quantum ergodicity and chaos or, at the opposite extreme, with complete integrability.   In particular, he wishes to analyse pair correlation functions of the spectra of some model quantum maps over compact symplectic manifolds and related fine structure invariants.   The motivation for these problems originated in physics. During the fifties, many physicists were studying the forces which hold the nucleus together.  These forces were not known, but certain aspects of them were observable.  In particular, the spectrum of energy levels of the nucleus could be measured in experiments. The 'inverse spectral problem' naturally arose- could the potential energy of the nucleus could be determined from these energy levels?  The answer is still basically unknown. On the one hand, different systems with the same spectrum have been constructed; on the other, these ambiguous systems have very unusual features and it seems likely that typical systems are determined by their spectra.  Another problem posed by nuclear physicists in the fifties, most famously by E. Wigner and L.D. Landau, was whether there was any pattern to the spacings between high energy levels. Do they just occur randomly?   This is now known as the level spacings problem. Numerous computer studies of physical systems and toy mathematical models indicate that the patterns are related to the degree of predictability or chaos of the system.  The reason why this should be so remains a mysterious mathematical problem.  However, the hope is that the new tools and developments described above will lead to worthwhile gains in insight into these fundamental problems."

Both  aspects of the study lie at the intersection of geometry and topology,  on the one hand, and theoretical physics (quantum field theory and  string theory) on the other.  One aspect concerns gauge-theoretic  invariants of four-dimensional manifolds, in particular, the Donaldson  polynomial invariants and the Seiberg-Witten invariants.  Here the aim  is to understand the relation of these invariants to more classical  geometric descriptions of a four-manifold, for example, a handlebody  description.  The other aspect is the study of holomorphic vector  bundles over elliptically fibered manifolds and the relation of these  to families of K3 surfaces that arise in F-theory in mathematical  physics.

There has been a resurgence in recent years of the interactions  between the areas of geometry and topology in mathematics and the areas  of quantum field theory and string theory in theoretical physics.  This  interaction has proved very fruitful for both disciplines -- the physics  brings new methods to the study of low dimensional spaces, and the  mathematics provides the framework in which the studies in theoretical  high-energy physics are done.  This project will investigate in more  detail two of these interactions.  One is the study of four-dimensional  spaces, using tools provided by theoretical physics.  These tools  have yielded much insight in the last few years, and there is much more  information about four-dimensional spaces that should be accessible  using these tools.  The other aspect of the project involves the  mathematics of a new physical theory.  This theory makes very precise  predictions about two kinds of mathematical objects that, on the face of it,  bear little relation to each other.  On the other hand, these mathemat ical  objects can be studied in their own right by purely mathematical tools  that have been developed independently of physics.  The results of the  mathematical analyses of these objects can be used to check the  predictions of the physical theory in much the same way as physical  experiments are used.  ***"
