Also as intrinsic geometric objects of the underlying space, minimal surfaces can be viewed as non-linear analog of the eigenstates in Quantum Mechanics.  The mathematical problem that amounts to showing that every bounding wire is spanned by at least one soap film has been studied in detail for many years and admits many important generalizations.  Most of the previous techniques for proving such existence properties focused on the ""minimizing theory"", which corresponds to finding the ground state in Quantum Mechanics.  One natural but very difficult technique, called the ""min-max theory"", corresponding to finding the excited states in Quantum Mechanics (i.e. the eigenstates with energy higher than the ground state), has had striking recent successes, and will be one of the major objects of study in this research program.  Another project will study geometric inequalities in general relativity, particularly aiming to understand the mass angular momentum inequalities for axisymmetric initial data sets which model rotating galaxies in astrophysics.<br/><br/>More specifically, the principal investigator will study the min-max theory for minimal surfaces via both the geometric measure theory approach and the harmonic map approach.  Concerning the geometric measure theory approach, some of the aspects of the min-max theory to be studied in this research program include extensions of the PI's index bound theorem beyond positive Ricci curvature conditions, as well as versions of the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory for more general ambient spaces, including manifolds with boundary and smooth metric measure spaces (where the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor plays a role).  Certain geometric problems related to the Min-max theory will be studied, such as Hersch-type estimates for higher-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces with bounded Morse index.  Concerning the min-max theory via harmonic maps, the PI intends to study the issue of Morse index and branch points of the min-max minimal surfaces constructed by Colding-Minicozzi and himself, and the corresponding free boundary problem."

If we think of the surface as a drumhead which vibrates freely at certain frequencies, then, roughly speaking, the more complicated a geometry we have the smaller its fundamental frequencies will be. This suggests the problem of looking for geometries which maximize the fundamental frequency for their area. This extremal question is a difficult and much studied problem. It turns out that the geometries which arise are related to surfaces of least area (soap films). The proposer will investigate such extremal configurations for surfaces with boundary. The other main area of investigation concerns the Einstein equations of general relativity. These equations describe the gravitational field for massive bodies in the universe. The theory is purely geometric and is a wave theory with an initial value formulation. The proposer is planning to investigate the geometry of solutions to give conditions under which gravitational collapse takes place and black holes are formed. Such questions lead to important geometric questions involving gravitational energy and curvature of spacetime.<br/><br/>The proposed research is at the interface between differential geometry, general relativity, and partial differential equations. A main theme of the research in geometry will be the study of spectral geometry. The PI plans to construct metrics on surfaces and certain higher dimensional manifolds subject to an area or boundary length constraint which maximize the first eigenvalue. This is a nonstandard type of variational problem since it involves maximizing and minimizing over infinite dimensional spaces of competitors. The PI will study the geometry of such maximizing metrics to determine the optimal shapes with largest fundamental frequency. In relativity, the PI intends to continue his investigations into the construction proposed by Bartnik of mass minimizing extensions of compact domains and static vacuum metrics. The PI also intends to study geometric properties of initial data sets concerning the question of whether they can contain non-compact stable trapped surfaces. Finally the PI intends to investigate global properties of the moduli space of solutions of the constraint equations which define the possible initial data for the Einstein equations. The PI shall pursue a range of questions concerning minimal submanifolds satisfying free boundary conditions and connections to eigenvalue problems. Finally the PI plans to continue his study of minimal lagrangian and special lagrangian submanifolds of Kahler-Einstein manifolds. The research will attempt to prove a conjecture concerning the invariance of the subgroup of the integral homology of a Calabi-Yau manifold which is generated by minimal lagrangian cycles when one deforms the ambient Calabi-Yau structure."

G. Fu<br/><br/>The subject of integral geometry grows out of the need to calculate the statistics of random shapes or objects. The basic idea is to begin by isolating certain fundamental quantitative geometric measurements that are finitely additive, in the sense that if an object is formed by amalgamating two smaller objects then the quantity associated to the total is equal to the sum of the quantities associated to the constituents, minus the quantity associated to their overlap. Such quantities, called valuations, include the volume and the surface area of a three-dimensional object, or the area and the perimeter of a two-dimensional figure. The statistics of how a given valuation varies over families of intersecting objects turns out to be governed by a rich system of algebraic rules, which constitute the focus of this project. Integral geometry should thus be viewed as a fundamentally important aspect of geometry as a whole, with many possible applications to the sciences.<br/><br/>The methods involved belong both to algebra and analysis. The objectives are to understand the algebraic questions arising from the interactions of valuations, and also the analytic problems surrounding the regularity properties necessary for their definition.  In the analytic direction our main aim is to refine recent results of Pokorny and Rataj on the regularity of sets definable by differences of convex functions. On the algebraic side, the past decade has seen a great deal of progress, largely catalyzed by the fundamental new algebraic structures on valuations introduced by S. Alesker in the early years of the century. From this perspective the classical integral geometry of Blaschke, Santalo, Chern, et al., dealing with the real space forms under the actions of their full isometry groups, appears as the trivial ground case of a much richer theory. The first nontrivial case is that of Hermitian integral geometry, i.e. the integral geometry of the complex space forms. Our recent results reveal that the algebra associated with this family of spaces is extremely rich, characterized by many mysterious and unexplained phenomena. One of our primary goals is to exploit our new-found ability to make computations in these cases with some degree of ease to explore how valuations behave in Riemannian manifolds without such extensive symmetries."

Davis Department of Mathematics celebration of sixty years of spectacular contributions to mathematics and physics by Professor Albert Schwarz. Indeed TQFTs were first constructed by Schwarz in the 1970s. Witten's solution of Chern--Simons TQFTs then laid the foundation for rapid progress connecting quantum field theory to rigorous mathematics, especially in the arena of the topological string theories that lie at the heart of unified String and M-Theory models. Concurrently, these ideas have led to profound advances in the mathematics of low dimensional topology; enumerative, symplectic and algebraic geometry; knot theory and even non-commutative geometry. The conference will be a unique opportunity for researchers to disseminate their latest results in these areas as well as for graduate students to see scientists of the highest calibre in action.<br/><br/>To understand the fundamental importance of this type of research, one can begin by considering the latest results coming from collider experiments. The discovery of the Higgs particle (and Nobel Prizes for its prediction) confirms once again that quantum field theory correctly describes our universe at the very largest and smallest scales. Members of the public might be surprised to learn that such an important theory as quantum field theory can still not be exactly defined mathematically. In fact, the main progress in this direction has been in special cases of topological theories that depend on the global shape of space and time (but are insensitive to small local phenomena). This conference addresses this gaping hole in our current understanding. A rigorous mathematical understanding of general quantum field theories will lead to an explosion of new mathematical and physical results likely to revolutionize science as we know it."

The proposal comprises several interconnected projects addressing these questions for certain classes of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and also for specific Hamiltonian systems such as magnetic flows. The PI will tackle these problems by employing methods from symplectic topology including Floer and quantum homological techniques, holomorphic curves, spectral invariants, Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory, as well as methods from differential geometry such as h-principles. The techniques utilized by the PI also have applications beyond the question of existence of infinitely many periodic orbits. In particular, the projects concerning the Poincaré recurrence, the Reeb flows and the coisotropic symplectic topology draw heavily on her recent works concerning periodic orbits. These projects have applications to measure-preserving and classical dynamical systems, and to some embedding problems in symplectic topology.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian systems constitute a broad class of physical systems where dissipative forces can be disregarded. For example, the planetary motion in celestial mechanics, the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid, and the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field are usually treated as Hamiltonian systems. One general, but not universal, feature of such systems is that they tend to have numerous periodic orbits. Corresponding to the cyclic motion, this is the simplest dynamical phenomenon after equilibrium, and an investigation of periodic orbits of a system is crucial in understanding its global behavior. To give but a few applications, the knowledge of periodic orbits is crucial in astronomy, fluid dynamics (e.g., statistics of turbulent flow) or can be used to understand stability of solutions for large times. In all but the simplest cases, establishing existence of periodic orbits often requires advanced and powerful mathematical tools. For a broad class of Hamiltonian systems, the number of periodic orbits is known to be infinite and this is thought to be the case for many, but not all, Hamiltonian systems.  The proposal focuses on the problem of existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for Hamiltonian dynamical systems in a variety of settings and on applications of the techniques used by the PI to attack this problem to some other related questions. The projects in the last part of the proposal concern a certain class of spaces which arise, for instance, in the study of Hamiltonian systems with symmetries. The proposed work is related to and has potential applications in mathematical physics, and geometric and quantum mechanics."

Since all physical events take places in a space, by Einstein's relativity the spatial metric properties  of the underlying space have fundamental  impacts on the physical events happening in the space, including the very one we live in. This relation places the subject of the differential geometry  in a central position of the mathematics and some fundamental issues of sciences. Modern differential geometry appeals to the theory/methods of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. The proposal involves the study of differential geometry via the method of the evolutional partial differential equations with the focus on the study of the entropy, the monotonicity, and related sharp differential estimates motives by thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.  The study of Gauss curvature flow has  important consequences on the subjects of the image processing,  affine differential geometry and convex geometry. The study of the Ricci flow in the proposal advances the understanding of the differential topological structure of the spaces and is related to the theoretic physics with direct bearing on the high energy physics. The resolving of the problems involved in the proposal advances the above mentioned related subjects in sciences.  The out-reach components of the proposal disseminate the new results to general public and contributes towards the mathematical education in the community in the greater area of San Diego and beyond. It also contributes to the training and the early career development of under-represented groups. <br/><br/><br/>The technical aspects of the proposal involve the development of the sharp monotonicity of the entropy and related sharp point wise estimates. The study of differential geometric problems relies on solving evolution equations such as the Ricci flow equation, Gauss curvature flow equation or other nonlinear evolution equations, and/or the study of delicate properties of the solutions obtained. The  theory of modern  partial differential equations reduces the study of the solutions of various linear and nonlinear equations to the monotonicity  of certain entropic quantities and related point wise estimates. The de-regularizing estimates proposed in this proposal broadens the scope of the already far-reaching gradient estimates, Hessian estimates and curvature estimates techniques developed in the last several decades to more general settings,  by requiring less regularity of the solutions involved, while encoding far more geometric information. They have produced  and will produce much powerful geometric consequences. The techniques developed can in turn advances the study of the related partial differential equations, which usually occupies a central role in the theory of the partial differential equations."

It will be centered on the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the geometry of Gromov-hyperbolic groups, and additional allied topics. Within the past 40 years or so there has been a sequence of discoveries which have revolutionized the study of ""most"" three dimensional manifolds, turning the study from a subject in topology to one of hyperbolic geometry with both topology and geometric group theory being essential ingredients. As a result, these manifolds can be studied geometrically, and in much greater depth than with the use of topology alone. Recent work has compounded the earlier work by bringing even greater depth to it. This work, whose discoverers have received the 2012 Clay Research Price and the 2013 Veblen prize, established properties of hyperbolic 3-manifolds conjectured by earlier researchers.  The new results confirmed that hyperbolic 3-manifolds in fact have the properties described in the Surface Subgroup Theorem, the Virtual Haken Theorem, and the Virtual Fibering Theorem. The purpose of this short, intense symposium is to bring to the participants details of this new work, and to explore options for applying the new discoveries even further afield. <br/><br/>There is a long history in mathematics of seeking to understand the geometry of all possible three dimensional shapes. In recent years, new techniques have been discovered to delve much more deeply in the range of possibilities. Indeed, it has been discovered that most of the shapes have an internal geometry, called hyperbolic geometry. The existence of this geometry allows mathematicians to work with general shapes, much as Euclidean geometry is used to explore our three dimensional world. It has resulted in an extensive detailed geometric description that formerly had not been thought possible. The symposium will be concerned with discussing technical details of this work  together with possible further applications of it. This award will support the participation of approximately forty graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty in the symposium. <br/><br/>Details are at  www.math.umn.edu/yamabe/2014"

The proposed research studies differential equations related to Einstein's equations and the key question is how the global structure of a space influences the local, analytic properties, such as singularities of the solutions of such equations. Understanding this phenomenon will have applications in physics and the sciences in general. In addition the principal investigator proposes integrated research and educational programs. These programs will raise interest in high school students towards mathematics, and it will encourage undergraduate students to pursue K-12 STEM education.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's proposed research is concerned with the study of canonical Kahler metrics on algebraic varieties, in particular the extremal metrics introduced by Calabi in the 1980's, and questions related to the J-flow introduced by Donaldson. The main conjecture in the field relates the existence of extremal metrics to the stability of the variety in the sense of geometric invariant theory, and the PI proposes an analogous conjecture for the J-flow. A particular feature of the proposal is a focus on situations when no extremal metric exists. On the algebro-geometric side the goal is to construct canonical degenerations of the variety and the PI's proposal is to use filtrations of the homogeneous coordinate ring, in analogy with Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of unstable vector bundles. On the differential geometric side one needs to understand the possible limiting behavior of families of extremal metrics. In general this is much more intricate than the much more thoroughly understood case of Kahler-Einstein metrics, and the PI proposes to first restrict attention to metrics with bounded curvature, and to relate the limiting behavior to filtrations. In the proposal a special emphasis is placed on the construction of new examples of extremal metrics, and the applications of these ideas to other problems in Kahler geometry."

Among the topics to be addressed are: groups and representations, quantum mechanics, quantum computation and information theory, symmetries in biosciences, wavelets, geometric mechanics, string theory, quantum gravity, exactly solvable systems, many-body systems and random matrix theory.<br/><br/><br/>The 2014 ICGTMP is the major meeting devoted to this interdisciplinary field, the prime venue for senior researchers to keep up with the latest exciting developments and to present their work to a highly interested audience, and for newcomers to the area to make valuable contacts and learn about the most promising areas for future research. This is one of the very few forums for mathematicians, theoretical physicists, experimental physicists, engineers and biologists to interact on symmetry-related problems of mutual interest.  Symmetry is arguably the most important concept that guides science in its exploration of nature. Mathematics enables one to exploit the symmetries inherent in modern physical theories. Physics draws heavily on symmetry ideas to provide structure in these theories, including such newer fields as quantum information theory and quantum computation. Engineering areas such as tomography and signal processing, including wavelets, radar and sonar are intimately bound up with symmetry analysis."

Such solutions and their stability can be studied on long time scales in relation to small scale models for light in optical media in nonlinear Schrodinger and Dirac models, surface waves on a surface tension scale in the gravity-capillary equations, or molecular dynamics in terms of both large scale nonlinear diffusions of crystals through thermodynamic fluctuations as well as Lagrangian mechanics for smaller systems of electrons trapped in various nuclear potentials.  They can also be studied in macroscopic systems such as interaction of surface waves and internal waves in coupled fluids models, vortex formation in fluid flow around biological objects in the Navier-Stokes equations with boundary, and dark matter formation in models from general relativity using Einstein-Scalar Field equations and their reductions as Schrödinger-Poisson models.  In applications that include large systems, complicated nonlinearities, and/or interesting geometric settings, the analysis and numerics can become increasingly difficult.  The quest to understand complexity in partial differential equation models has led to the development of dramatically new analytic and computational techniques to explore questions of symmetry, phase transitions, uniqueness for the attractive states, as well as generalizations of Fourier transform methods using scattering theory, spectral theory and microlocal analysis to understand their stability.  These techniques can be applied for instance on spaces with curvature, boundary, metric singularities or other difficult features such as noise in a sample or trapping due to external potential wells.  <br/><br/><br/>This proposal will involve research in partial differential equations directly related to optics and electronic structure with relevant boundary conditions and potentials, as well as other equations from fluid dynamics, general relativity and thermodynamic fluctuations on crystal surfaces.  The PI will also work with postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates on integrated research into models, computation and experiment, especially though collaboration with members of the UNC Fluids Lab and International Mathematics Climate Network.  An important aspect of that training will be to develop graduate courses and undergraduate courses in dynamics and computation to prepare trainees for a variety of careers in science.  From a human resources standpoint, models like those in this proposal provide a large pool of problems that give a strong background in computation and geometry, as well as some applied statistics, which can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral, then applied in many scientific fields. In addition, the PI will continue to support the mathematics department role in the University of North Carolina Science Expo to work towards broader outreach goals of making mathematical sciences more accessible to the public."

These sparse and yet highly connected graphs are of fundamental importance in building communication networks, in computer algorithms, and in the theory of error-correcting codes. The study of expander graphs has been drawing tools from deep mathematics, such as number theory, representation theory, and topology. In recent years the study of expanders also provided new problems for pure mathematicians. This interplay of mathematics and computer science has been very productive. The current proposal aims at taking the theory of expanders one step further by initiating a systematic study of high-dimensional expanders, which are simplical complexes of high dimensions having similar properties of expanders. The problems in the high-dimensional case are more difficult, but the theory we hope to develop can be expected to be powerful in applications. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs plan to consider various ways to extend the definition of expanders, e.g., via spectrum, cohomology  or  topology. Of particular interest are the Ramanujan complexes, which generalize the Ramanujan graphs. Their extremal properties (proved by methods of representation theory and number theory) together with their remarkable symmetry are expected to be useful in solving several problems. Of special importance is Gromov's topological overlapping property. It is hoped that the extremal properties of Ramanujan complexes will help resolve some problems of basic importance in the theory of error-correcting codes, as well as in other areas of computer science."

The current project will further the  understanding  of the long time evolution of geometric flows of this type, and it will provide a precise determination of the   singular structure of solutions to these equations. A second important aspect of this research is the global nature of the entire space of solutions (called the moduli space). Understanding the structure of moduli spaces reveals underlying phenomena that unify and explain particular aspects of individual examples. The  Yang-Mills equations and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles are the major examples of  interest to the PI. They  also form an important  point of intersection between mathematics and theoretical physics.

This subject arose from several threads in the 19th century: (1) symmetries of crystals, which developed into the theory of crystallographic groups; (2) conformal mapping, and the corresponding holomorphic differential equations and their monodromy groups, which led to the classical theory of uniformization; (3) classical differential geometry of surfaces, generalized to Riemannian geometry, and later to Lorentzian geometry influenced by Einstein's theory of gravitation. The notion of a geometry itself was algebraicized by Felix Klein, who interpreted a geometry as the properties invariant under a transitive action of a Lie group. The present study investigates the possible ways of putting a geometric structure on a topological manifold in terms of the fundamental group and the Lie group. The goal is to describe when a given topology (often described by a combinatorial object) can be given the given geometry. In several cases, there is a complete classification of geometric structures, and the moduli space itself enjoys both a rich geometry of its own and symmetries of its own, which lead to intricate dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The specific goals and scope of this project involve flat projective and conformal structures, especially in dimension three. The recent classification of complete affine 3-manifolds leads to many questions about more general structures. In particular the proposal asked which groups which admit proper affine actions; at present the only known hyperbolic groups are free groups. The methods involve a combination of dynamical systems, algebraic group theory, topology and geometric group theory and representation theory. Other important questions include finding obstructions for a 3-manifold to admit a projective structure; at present only one such closed 3-manifold is known. Computer experiments can help in this direction, and projects in the Experimental Geometry Lab can suggest new examples of geometric structures."

More specifically, the CAREER Award will fund Pelayo's investigations on classical and quantum semitoric systems. A classical semitoric system is an integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom for which one component generates a periodic flow. For mathematicians, semitoric systems form the next natural class of systems after toric systems. Semitoric systems retain some properties of toric systems, while at the same time they exhibit a much greater flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in the existence of singularities which are dynamically and symplectically rich.Semitoric systems are commonly found in simple physical models and arise naturally as examples in analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry. As a matter of fact, a semitoric system defines a singular toric fibration whose base comes endowed with a singular integral affine structure. These singular affine structures are a central concept in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry. A semitoric quantum system is given by two commuting self-adjoint semiclassical operators acting on a Hilbert space whose principal symbols form a classical semitoric system. One of Pelayo's main goals is  to study the spectral theory of semitoric quantum systems and how it relates to classical systems. Concretely, Pelayo's plan is to work towards verifying that the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system determines completely the system; this is the Spectral Conjecture, widely considered the most spectacular problem in the area.  Proving this conjecture requires establishing a number of results in semiclassical analysis, giving a tool for future research in the field, independent of the conjecture. Another component of Pelayo's research plans is to continue studying semitoric systems in a more general context, in particular as it regards to the study of the convexity and connectivity properties of the singular Lagrangian fibrations which semitoric systems induce, and which are of special interest in mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The research that the CAREER Award will support belongs to the context of  dynamics and geometry.  Dynamics  is the study of the motion of bodies. Geometry is the study of shape (broadly understood) of objects and spaces.More specifically, the CAREER Award will support Pelayo's research at the intersection of symplectic geometry, spectral theory  and dynamics. Symplectic geometry has its roots in physics, and provides an appropriate mathematical framework to study many problems of physics and chemistry and their quantum counterparts. Pelayo's research on this topic exhibits the interplay between mathematical and physical theories. Indeed, several groups of physicists and chemists working on modern quantum spectroscopy have been interested in seeing how mathematical methods can  contribute to advance their research, and predict new physical phenomena. They have been particularly interested in understanding the global structure of joint energy-momentum spectra of small molecules. Even more, they have recognized the pivotal role that mathematical invariants play in this problem. Their works have motivated a large number of mathematical questions. The physicists have asked whether one can single out an optimal set of mathematical invariants that would characterize a physical system and then detect these invariants in the spectrum of the system.  The detection of the invariants in the system spectrum will allow us to reconstruct the system and hence predict new phenomena. The CAREER Award will support Pelayo's investigations into this crucial question.  These applications to quantum molecular spectroscopy are integrated in Pelayo's approach of employing methods from pure mathematics (symplectic and spectral theory, microlocal analysis) to address problems from the applied sciences. More generally,  Pelayo's  research is focused on a fundamental type of physical system, the so called integrable systems. One can find direct applications of integrable systems in numerous contexts. Some such examples are nonlinear control,  locomotion generation in robotics, elasticity theory, plasma physics, field theory and planetary mission design. In order to communicate this relevance of mathematical research to the general public, Pelayo has been interviewed on several occasions by the press (radio and magazines with several hundred thousand audience members). He has commented and advocated for an understanding of the leading role that mathematicians play in the advance of applied science and technology in society. Pelayo will continue actively reaching out to the general public during the tenure of the award, and will continue to take a leading role at Washington University outreach programs. In this respect he will run a  Talent Identification Program at Washington University to encourage and nurture undergraduate research at an early stage."

This field is today the subject of vigorous research activity.  The PI, along with his graduate students and collaborators, will study connections between symplectic topology and two other parts of geometry, each superficially quite different. The first connection is to algebraic geometry, and is through the phenomenon known by the metaphorical name of ""mirror symmetry"". In mirror symmetry, objects from symplectic topology reappear in transformed form into algebraic form in a looking-glass world. The inter-relations between the symplectic objects and those between the algebraic objects match precisely, in an astounding way. Mirror symmetry was proposed around 1990 by physicists working in string theory, and for years, mathematicians could verify it in examples but not explain it. The PI contends that a quarter-century after its inception, the time has come to prove basic theorems conceptualizing how mirror symmetry works.  The second connection is to geometry in dimensions 3 and 4.  Though the two parts of the project touch on different parts of mathematics, they share common technical tools, the theories of ""pseudo-holomorphic curves"" and ""Floer cohomology"". A significant part of the proposal is to support the training of graduate students working on the two aspects of the project.<br/><br/>The two strands of the research proposed in this project are both based on symplectic Floer cohomology, a tool in symplectic topology that is proving as incisive and adaptable as singular cohomology is in algebraic topology.  One strand explores structural aspects of the connection between symplectic topology and algebraic geometry known as mirror symmetry, in the setting of Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds. Homological mirror symmetry, and the Fukaya category of a CY manifold, take center-stage. Key to the proposal is the investigation of logical relationships between different formulations of mirror symmetry: constructions of mirror pairs;  homological mirror symmetry; Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry; and enumeration of holomorphic curves. The other strand arises from the relationship between the symplectic and gauge-theoretic versions of Floer cohomology.  The proposal is to develop a new Floer cohomology theory for 3-manifolds using the same mechanism as the hugely productive Heegaard Floer homology of Ozsvath-Szabo, but working not in a symmetric product of the Heegaard surface (made a complex curve), as one does in Heegaard Floer homology, but rather in a space of ""stable pairs"" on the Heegaard surface, consisting of a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle together with a holomorphic section thereof. This theory is likely to have close relations both to Heegaard Floer homology itself, and to instanton Floer theory, and may illuminate the relations between those theories."

Geometric analysts use nonlinear differential equations to try to classify and understand the possible structures that can occur in geometric spaces.  An equation known as the Ricci flow has been used to great success to show that every three dimensional space can be cut up into pieces, each of which has a well-understood geometry.  The Ricci flow works by evolving a metric, which defines a notion of distance between two points, by a nonlinear heat flow process.  However, for spaces of dimension four or higher (such as the space-time we live in), this process is not yet well understood.  A major goal of this project is to investigate nonlinear equations on spaces of dimension four and higher with the aim of classifying these spaces and understanding the natural geometric structures that live on them.  This project focuses on spaces endowed with a 'complex structure'.  Despite the name, spaces with complex structures are easier to study, since this additional structure limits the kinds of singularities that could occur.  Complex geometries appear in physical theories, such as string theory.  This project will investigate complex geometries in four dimensions, using a new heat flow equation known as the Chern-Ricci flow.   In higher dimensions, an equation analogous to the Calabi-Yau equation (much studied in string theory) will be used to investigate the structure of these spaces.<br/><br/>This project will investigate nonlinear PDEs in complex geometry, with a focus on spaces which are non-Kahler.  The PI will build on results for the Kahler-Ricci flow on complex surfaces to understand the behavior of the Chern-Ricci flow, a PDE which makes sense even in the non-Kahler case.  This project will investigate the behavior of the Chern-Ricci flow in relation to the classification of complex surfaces.  In particular, the PI will study how exceptional curves are contracted by this flow, and how the flow behaves on Class VII surfaces.  For higher dimensional non-Kahler complex manifolds, the PI will use the complex Monge-Ampere equation to study questions about cohomology and existence of Kahler currents.  In addition, the PI will study a new Monge-Ampere equation for (n-1)-plurisubharmonic functions, which is related to Gauduchon and balanced metrics on complex manifolds.  A solution to this new equation will solve a long-standing conjecture of Gauduchon and have possible applications to deformation problems for projective varieties.  Finally, the PI intends to extend these ideas to a Monge-Ampere type equation of Donaldson on symplectic 4-manifolds with compatible almost complex structures.  A conjecture of Donaldson on existence of solutions to this equation can be reduced to a second order estimate.  If this estimate holds it would give applications to the symplectic topology of 4-manifolds."

The theory of knots -- ordinary, tangled loops of string in three-dimensional space -- goes back to Lord Kelvin, who proposed that the periodic table was made from different knotted forms of the ether.  Since that time, knot theory became a well-established subject in mathematics, even as the physics of Kelvin's proposal came into disfavor.  The main challenge of knot theory in mathematics is to recognize when two knots are the same or different.  More recently, knots have reappeared in the mathematical physics relating to supersymmetric gauge theory and string theory. Through their reappearance in mathematical physics, knots have re-emerged in mathematics in sophisticated form. This project will elucidate the interplay among these fields within math and physics, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. In addition, the principal investigator will train graduate students, support a research seminar, run a math circle, and perform other activities aimed at developing young mathematicians.<br/><br/>""Knots, Sheaves, and Mirrors"" refers first to a connection between Legendrian knots and constructible sheaves, and second to a study of the moduli spaces involved under the identification. A Legendrian knot can arise as a boundary-at-infinity of a Lagrangian submanifold, so given the micro localization theorem (proved by the principal investigator and Nadler) relating sheaves and the Fukaya category, it is perhaps not surprising that Legendrians have a purely sheaf-theoretic description.  In fact, the exact relationship is somewhat subtle, but in the end one can equate augmentations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra with constructible sheaves on the base plane containing the front diagram.  With this equivalence in hand, it is then natural, following the ideas of mirror symmetry, to study the moduli spaces of ""rank-one"" objects --- and these prove to be interesting spaces, related to Bott-Samelson resolutions, from which one can recover categorized HOMFLY invariants of the knot.  The project will also study the sheaf-theoretic description of Legendrian conormals of topological knots (along the lines of Aganagic-Ekholm-Ng-Vafa), wild Hitchin systems corresponding to algebraic singularities whose link is the knot."

The planned applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as inverse problems for determining a function from integrals along curves (X-ray transform) and related problems for determining the structure of a material from boundary measurements. Although the proposal concerns their mathematical theory, these problems are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with electromagnetic waves, such as light, being one of the most prevalent examples; the theory of general relativity being another important physical example. Scattering theory of quantum particles (such as protons and electrons) is another subject governed by microlocal analysis: these aspects enter both into the description of quantum waves at large distances, and into semiclassical phenomena, i.e. when Planck's constant can be regarded as small, which happens often in chemistry. The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance: an application of the theory developed here is the determination of an unknown variable sound speed in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, which for instance is relevant to imaging to interior of Earth using the travel times of earthquake waves.<br/><br/>Some of the proposed projects describe the long-time or far field behavior of waves on curved space-times. Physically these arise in general relativity, including electromagnetic waves on a curved background. However, there are also examples of purely mathematical origin, such as asymptotically complex hyperbolic (ACH) space and asymptotically Anti de Sitter spaces (AdS); the latter does have a different connection with physics via string theory. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in the author's work on linear problems asymptotically (real) hyperbolic (AH) spaces as well as Kerr-de Sitter space. The projects here aim to extend these tools to the ACH, AdS-type spaces, improve the understanding of Lorentzian scattering spaces (which include asymptotically Minkowski spaces), as well as to quasilinear PDE. Other projects concern the behavior of waves at edges, concretely the diffraction of the Rayleigh (surface) waves of elasticity and a refined, second-microlocal, description of diffraction of scalar or electromagnetic waves. Yet another main area is inverse problems, where the author, together with Uhlmann, has introduced new tools for spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform. The projects aim to extend this to tensors, and to investigate boundary rigidity, i.e. recovering a Riemannian metric from its boundary distance function."

In physics, they are used to describe the space-time in Einstein's theory of general relativity. In mathematics, they are basic building blocks of more complicated geometries. The study of Einstein manifolds is thus a basic problem in geometry. One effective way to construct Einstein manifolds is to require that the underlying manifold has a complex algebraic structure. In other words, the points of such a manifold are complex-valued solutions of polynomial equations. Einstein metrics on such algebraic manifolds are called Kaehler-Einstein metrics. In the late 70s, Aubin and Yau constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with negative Ricci curvatures. Yau also constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with zero Ricci curvatures, which are now called Calabi-Yau metrics and play important roles in the string theory of physics. On the other hand, only recently has people pinned down a sufficient and necessary condition, called K-stability, for the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics with positive Ricci curvatures for a class of algebraic manifolds called Fano manifolds. This result depends on the work of many people, most importantly by Tian and Donaldson. After these discoveries, we want to further our understandings of such Kaehler-Einstein metrics and the obstructions to their existence. These problems are the main concerns of the proposal. The study of these Kaehler-Einstein metrics will greatly improve our understanding of Einstein manifolds important in both physics and mathematics. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PI will study the following closely related problems. 1.Various continuity methods of partial differential equations are used to solve the Kaehler-Einstein equation. The recent breakthroughs give qualitative pictures of blow up behaviors and convergences of these continuity methods. However, deeper quantitative understandings of the blow up behaviors or singularity forming phenomena are needed. The PI has studied in detail such quantitative properties for toric Fano manifolds. The PI will study the singularities forming processes for a broader class of Fano manifolds. The PI will also study the classification of the singularities formed in low dimensions by combining the methods from Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry. 2.The PI will study concrete constructions of Kaehler-Einstein metrics and related canonical metrics. On the one hand, the PI likes to extend the construction of toric Kaehler-Einstein metrics to other Kaehler-Einstein metrics with large symmetries, for example, on spherical varieties. On the other hand, the PI will study the classification of Sasaki-Einstein metrics with large symmetries in low dimensions based on his calculations of important examples. Related methods will also be applied to construct Kaehler-Ricci solitons and extremal Kaehler metrics. 3.The PI will study the deformations of canonical Kaehler metrics including Kaehler-Einstein metrics and Kaehler-Ricci solitons, and to understand the moduli spaces of these canonical Kaehler metrics. He will also study the singularities on the boundaries of these moduli spaces. 4.The PI and his collaborator will study the K-stability using algebraic geometry based on their previous work on K-stability. They will use tools from minimal model program to test K-stability. This will allow us to get Kaehler-Einstein metrics using algebro-geometric methods."

A ""classical geometry"" means the structure of a manifold invariant under a transitive action of a Lie group. For a fixed topology, the space of such structures is a natural object, with a rich geometry and symmetry of its own, associated with the topology and the homogeneous space.  The study of deformation spaces of geometric structures was initiated by Charles Ehresmann in the 1930's. It unifies what have been disparate areas of research in the 19th century (crystallography, holomorphic differential equations and conformal mapping, development of projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry). The subject became prominent through the influence of William Thurston in the 1970's.  The prototype of this theory is the space of hyperbolic geometry structures on a closed surface, which by the classical uniformization theorem, identifies with the Teichmueller space of the surface. Our project explores three recent developments - geometric structures on 3-manifolds, higher Thurston-Teichmueller theory, and Anosov representations - where the rich structure of Teichmueller space generalizes to deformation spaces of more complicated geometries.  The intimate relations of this subject with many other fields of mathematics underscores its central role in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project synthesizes disparate mathematical subjects: the topology of manifolds, various kinds of geometry, algebra and dynamics. The Moebius band is an example of a two dimensional manifold with only one side. It describes, for example, the collection of all straight lines in the plane.  The universe we live in is an example of a three dimensional manifold.  The position and velocity of a satellite or missile is described by a point in a six-dimensional manifold. Different kinds of geometries distinguish special properties of manifolds.  The Moebius band is naturally described using the projective geometry inspired by the work of Renaissance painters. Cartographers used conformal geometry to produce more accurate maps of the world. Differential geometry enabled Einstein to develop his theory of gravitation. Chemists use the algebra of groups to classify crystals. The periodic table of chemical elements is intimately connected to the group of rotations of space.  Much of this mathematical landscape remains unexplored.  Using modern computers, students can contribute to this investigation.  The exploration of explicit examples and their interactions provides problems for talented students, inviting them to the excitement of mathematical research."

Higher Teichmueller<br/>spaces are connected components of the variety of representations<br/>of the fundamental group of a surface into semisimple Lie groups,<br/>which share essential properties with Teichmueller<br/>space. Classical Teichmueller space plays an important role in<br/>various fields of mathematics due to its rich structure and the<br/>fact that it is a smooth cover of the moduli space of Riemann<br/>surfaces.  For higher Teichmueller spaces many potentially<br/>interesting structures are yet to be discovered and the relation<br/>to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces still needs to be<br/>clarified. The proposed research focusses on identifying the<br/>geometric objects (similar to hyperbolic surfaces in the case of<br/>classical Teichmueller space) which are parametrized by higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces. These objects will then be used to define<br/>algebraic, geometric and dynamical structures on higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces, and we expect that they will help to<br/>construct a natural map from higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>classical Teichmueller space.<br/><br/>Teichmueller space is the space of all geometric surfaces with a<br/>fixed combinatorial type. Because it parametrizes all surfaces,<br/>Teichmueller space is a fundamental mathematical object which<br/>also plays an important role in theoretical physics. Every point<br/>in Teichmueller space corresponds to a tiling of the Euclidean<br/>plane, the two-dimensional sphere or in most cases the hyperbolic<br/>plane by one polygon and its images under subsequent reflections<br/>in the sides. (Nice pictures inspired by such tilings appear in<br/>M.C. Escher's work.) The combinatorial type of the surface is<br/>determined by the number of vertices of the polygon and the<br/>gluing data, but the geometry of the surface depends on the<br/>length of the sides and the angles at the vertices of the<br/>polygon. Teichmueller space is the example of a moduli space of a<br/>pattern (the tiling) with rich symmetries (the reflections in the<br/>side of the polygon). Such moduli spaces can be efficiently<br/>studied via the group generated by the symmetries of the<br/>pattern. Higher Teichmueller spaces are moduli spaces of more<br/>complicated patterns in higher dimensional spaces. However, the<br/>symmetry group of these patterns is the same as the symmetry<br/>group of the tilings associated to classical Teichmueller<br/>space. Therefore one expects higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>parametrize geometric objects which are not surfaces themselves,<br/>but closely related to surfaces. The proposed research focusses<br/>on identifying these geometric objects and studying their finer<br/>structure.<br/><br/>The project proposes various activities to involve graduate<br/>students in research and teaching, as for instance a yearly<br/>mathematical retreat for graduate students to study, explore and<br/>present a mathematical topic in a group, and small workshops with<br/>mini-courses which allow graduate students to get insight into<br/>the working of modern research collaborations.<br/>"

This project focuses on one current area of interplay, between topology (the study of shapes) on the mathematical side and string theory on the physics side. The jumping-off point for the project is an intriguing and unexpected connection, recently discovered by the Principal Investigator and collaborators on both sides, between two separate algebraic structures associated to knots in space: one in topology developed by the Principal Investigator, and one in string theory that has been the focus of much research in the past few years. In the course of this project, the Principal Investigator will establish this connection, which is currently only supported circumstantially; it is hoped that this work will create and strengthen new lines of communication between mathematics and physics, introducing techniques from each discipline into the other. The Principal Investigator will also use this project to train future mathematicians at all levels, from contributing to the annual USA Mathematical Olympiad for high school students, to supervising the research of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, to organizing conferences and seminars for established researchers.<br/><br/>In the past decade, the Principal Investigator has introduced and studied a package of knot invariants called knot contact homology, which arises by counting holomorphic curves in certain symplectic manifolds, using a method in symplectic geometry pioneered by Gromov and Floer and more recently culminating in the Symplectic Field Theory of Eliashberg, Givental, and Hofer. Previous work has shown that knot contact homology is a robust invariant that is effective at distinguishing knots and contains classical topological information about the knot. In 2012, it was discovered by Aganagic, Ekholm, Vafa, and the Principal Investigator that knot contact homology has an unexpected and potentially powerful relation to string theory and mirror symmetry: the augmentation polynomial, a knot invariant derived from knot contact homology, is conjectured to be equal to Aganagic and Vafa's Q-deformed A-polynomial, which arises in the context of topological strings. The Principal Investigator will approach this conjecture using Lagrangian fillings and Gromov-Witten potentials. This could have significant ramifications in different directions: in knot theory, it would establish a variant of the AJ conjecture; in mirror symmetry, it would produce a new approach via Symplectic Field Theory to constructing mirror Calabi-Yau 3-folds; and in topological string theory, it would provide a mathematical foundation for recent results. In related work, the Principal Investigator will develop and strengthen the algebraic framework underneath certain aspects of Symplectic Field Theory, including knot contact homology and symplectic homology. New algebraic tools in this context, such as representation theory for differential graded algebras, would enable one to more effectively attack problems in symplectic geometry, in particular by analyzing Weinstein structures on symplectic manifolds and Legendrian and transverse knots in contact manifolds."

An important idea in theoretical physics is the notion of a duality between physical theories. A consequence of such a duality is a deep connection between the mathematical models that describe those theories. These connections allow us to look at a mathematical question in one model from another perspective, and thus derive new results. For this project, the mathematical models come from algebraic geometry (the geometry of sets defined by polynomial equations) and representation theory (the study of symmetry) on the one hand, and symplectic geometry (the geometry of the phase spaces of classical mechanics) on the other. The duality relating them is known as homological mirror symmetry. The focus of this project is to mine this connection for new insights into structures arising on each side of the duality. One part of the project studies how symmetries arise in symplectic geometry, and how this new perspective can give insights into representation theory. Another part studies the relationship between dynamics in symplectic geometry and one of the most basic objects in algebraic geometry, namely functions. The project also supports the training of graduate and early-career mathematicians in this rapidly-developing area of research. More broadly, this project fits into the ongoing interaction between mathematics and physics that has, over the centuries, led to theoretical advances that have enabled the transformative technologies of our time.<br/><br/><br/>The organizing principle for this project is homological mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau varieties (varieties arising as the complement of an anticanonical divisor in a compactification). We consider such varieties both for the algebraic and the symplectic sides of the correspondence. On the symplectic side, the main structure we consider is symplectic cohomology, an algebraic structure that is built out of periodic orbits of certain Hamiltonian flows on a symplectic manifold (hence the connection to dynamics). The heart of the project is to relate this structure to functions and vector fields on the mirror algebraic variety. The connection to representation theory appears by considering the flag variety of a semisimple algebraic group G on the algebraic side. These are not log Calabi-Yau, but they contain open subsets which are, and part of the project is to understand better how to pass between the two situations (this involves considering a potential function on the symplectic side). The symmetries of the flag variety, namely the group G and its Lie algebra, should appear in the symplectic side as well. The natural home for the Lie algebra is symplectic cohomology, and the group action itself is manifested in the action of this Lie algebra on the Floer cohomology of equivariant Lagrangian submanifolds, which are the counterpart of equivariant vector bundles in algebraic geometry. Ultimately, one expects to obtain representations of G in the Lagrangian Floer cohomology groups. The pay-off for this effort is that these Floer cohomology groups come with a distinguished basis, and this project seeks to understand how that basis is related to the various known canonical bases in representation theory of Lusztig, Mirkovic-Vilonen, and others. In approaching these problems, the project uses ideas from the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow approach to mirror symmetry, as developed by Gross-Siebert and Gross-Hacking-Keel, as well as techniques developed by the PI in previous work on the case of log Calabi-Yau surfaces (complex dimension two)."

If we think of the surface as a drumhead which vibrates freely at certain frequencies, then, roughly speaking, the more complicated a geometry we have the smaller its fundamental frequencies will be. This suggests the problem of looking for geometries which maximize the fundamental frequency for their area. This extremal question is a difficult and much studied problem. It turns out that the geometries which arise are related to surfaces of least area (soap films). The proposer will investigate such extremal configurations for surfaces with boundary. The other main area of investigation concerns the Einstein equations of general relativity. These equations describe the gravitational field for massive bodies in the universe. The theory is purely geometric and is a wave theory with an initial value formulation. The proposer is planning to investigate the geometry of solutions to give conditions under which gravitational collapse takes place and black holes are formed. Such questions lead to important geometric questions involving gravitational energy and curvature of spacetime.<br/><br/>The proposed research is at the interface between differential geometry, general relativity, and partial differential equations. A main theme of the research in geometry will be the study of spectral geometry. The PI plans to construct metrics on surfaces and certain higher dimensional manifolds subject to an area or boundary length constraint which maximize the first eigenvalue. This is a nonstandard type of variational problem since it involves maximizing and minimizing over infinite dimensional spaces of competitors. The PI will study the geometry of such maximizing metrics to determine the optimal shapes with largest fundamental frequency. In relativity, the PI intends to continue his investigations into the construction proposed by Bartnik of mass minimizing extensions of compact domains and static vacuum metrics. The PI also intends to study geometric properties of initial data sets concerning the question of whether they can contain non-compact stable trapped surfaces. Finally the PI intends to investigate global properties of the moduli space of solutions of the constraint equations which define the possible initial data for the Einstein equations. The PI shall pursue a range of questions concerning minimal submanifolds satisfying free boundary conditions and connections to eigenvalue problems. Finally the PI plans to continue his study of minimal lagrangian and special lagrangian submanifolds of Kahler-Einstein manifolds. The research will attempt to prove a conjecture concerning the invariance of the subgroup of the integral homology of a Calabi-Yau manifold which is generated by minimal lagrangian cycles when one deforms the ambient Calabi-Yau structure."

This theory is at the foundation of our understanding of gravity and has applications in everyday use, such as global positioning system (GPS) technology, now present in most smart phones.  General relativity also unifies the notions of space, time, mass, and energy and provides the framework for understanding supermassive black holes and the Big Bang, the most energetic event in the history of the universe.  More specifically, this project focuses on finding a better understanding of the notion of mass in general relativity, whether it relates to a black hole or to defining the mass of an exploding supernova.  Since geometric analysis is the field of mathematics required to precisely state general relativity, this project will use many techniques from geometric analysis to study these questions.<br/><br/>Even more specifically, this project has two main research directions. The first is motivated by the desire to understand the geometry and mass of surfaces in spacetimes.  Jeff Jauregui, Marc Mars, and the PI have found that the Hawking mass of a surface is nondecreasing under a new geometric flow called ""uniformly area expanding time flat flow.""  The key idea is that the Hawking mass can overestimate the mass of a region inside a surface if the surface is not ""time flat,"" which we define precisely.  A time flat surface is a generalization of the concept of a surface contained in a constant time slice of a static spacetime. Uniformly area expanding time flat flow, which is interesting by itself, grows the area form of the surface at a constant rate while keeping the surface, as a whole, time flat.  Existence, uniqueness, and asymptotics of this flow are very important questions to study in a variety of contexts.  The second research direction, which is related to the first, is to understand the mass of black holes as they relate to the Penrose conjecture, open since 1973.  While the PI proved the Riemannian Penrose conjecture for any number of black holes in 1999, which is the case when the hypersurface of a spacetime has zero second fundamental form, the general case pertaining to any slice of a spacetime is still open. While these questions can be posed in the language of physics, they are also important statements relating to scalar and Ricci curvature, minimal surfaces and mean curvature, isoperimetric regions, connections on bundles, submanifold geometry, geometric flows, and geometric partial differential equations."

The meeting is devoted to the bicentennial of the Great Poncelet Theorem.  The meeting will focus on the most recent developments on the crossroad of geometry and dynamical systems, with a special focus on integrable systems and applications in classical mechanics and nonholonomic dynamics.  The two-week event will be organized in two parts. The first week is devoted to the school. The second week is devoted to the conference. The school part will focus on recent developments in interrelations between geometry and dynamical systems, with special attention to integrable systems. The school will provide a background in algebraic geometry, theory of measured foliations and flat surfaces, interval exchange transformations, the discrete integrable systems, 2-2 correspondences, and the QRT maps.<br/><br/><br/>The aim of the GDIS 2014 Conference and School is threefold. First, the organizers will provide a stimulating atmosphere for the invited speakers to present the latest developments in the fields of geometry, dynamics, integrability, and their applications to mechanics. Second, researchers at the postdoctoral level, as well as PhD students, will be encouraged to make contributions and present their results. The third aim is to prepare graduate and undergraduate students through the school part -- a series of mini courses -- to follow the conference part more effectively and help them to trace their path to the current state-of-the-art level of science. The conference will bring together scientists from all over the world including the five continents, both from developed and developing countries, minorities, women, and it will provide an opportunity for researchers and students to share their latest ideas and to collaborate with each other. Since the conference and school GDIS 2014 focuses on relationships between several popular areas of research, it has potential to attract young mathematicians, encourage minorities and women to participate in exciting cross-disciplinary research and look for new applications of their research in other fields of science. The knowledge obtained on this occasion will be disseminated by participants literally throughout the world.<br/><br/>http://cdsagenda5.ictp.trieste.it/full_display.php?smr=0&ida=a13202"

Gauge theory, in special cases, is believed to underline the mathematical description of the universe; for example, the standard model for particle physics is a gauge theory in 4 dimensions. Much mathematical research into quantum physics over the last half-century has focussed on the analysis required to make accurate experimental predictions, but what was missed until the last decade or two was that topological (distance-independent) features of the theory are governed by an underlying algebra, which has some novel and unexplored features. The PI will study fundamental questions pertaining to this algebra in low dimension.<br/><br/>The main project aims at a rigid description of topological gauge theory (the so-called A-model) by the tested technique of mirror symmetry, which converts ""soft"" topological questions, defined up to coherent systems of homotopies, into rigid questions of analytic or algebraic geometry. The PI has a proposal for the mirror of pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions, which controls the gauging and 2-dimensional gauge theories such as arise from symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian group actions. Another component of the research involves gauge theory in 3 dimensions, specifically Chern-Simons theory, which seems to lie half-way between the soft A- and the rigid B-model. Finally, a small project involving representation theory (geometric Langlands duality for algebraic curves) will be undertaken: the construction of a generic Langlands kernel for simply laced groups, which relies on cohomological and algebro-geometric techniques, but the subject is informed and inspired by electric-magnetic duality for gauge theory in 4 dimensions."

The previous project incorporated a number of mechanisms for training enhancement, some of which worked better than others. The group will expand on the successful mechanisms and try follow-up innovations. <br/><br/>With geometry and topology becoming ever more multifaceted and technical, it is difficult for students to acquire the tools they need for research. The activities of this research group will benefit trainees at all levels, beginning with a strong effort to recruit undergraduate students into research, continuing with seminars and hot topics courses to train graduate students in the latest techniques, and finally including mentoring to help postdoctoral fellows to launch their research careers. The mechanisms to provide such training will include an undergraduate research class during the school year taught by graduate students, a summer undergraduate research program run by graduate students under the guidance of senior faculty, undergraduate mentoring by postdoctoral fellows, a background seminar for graduate students and others, a geometry and topology colloquium, hot topics courses taught by senior faculty, summer graduate workshops taught by postdoctoral fellows, and an exchange program with the Max-Planck-Institute in Bonn. The project will involve approximately three postdoctoral associates, twelve graduate students per year, twelve undergraduates in each of the undergraduate research programs, and thirty participants in each of the summer graduate workshops. The proposed training activities will increase the number of US citizens and permanent residents entering and continuing in mathematics research, both directly and indirectly: directly via the recruiting and support of the trainees in the group, and indirectly via the establishment of models for research training that can be emulated elsewhere."

Black holes loom large in the imagination as mysterious regions of space in which the force of gravity is so enormous that nothing, including light, can escape. However, black holes are mathematical constructs, first discovered as explicit solutions of the Einstein field equations that lie at the foundation of General Relativity. The best known family of such solutions, discovered by the applied mathematician R. Kerr, depends on two parameters. It was only later that physicists were able to relate some remarkable astrophysical objects, such as quasars, to these remarkable Kerr solutions. Yet, by definition, black holes cannot be detected by direct observation, and the claim that quasars are associated with massive black holes is based on indirect observations deemed consistent with the specific mathematical properties of the black hole solutions. This project investigates three fundamental questions concerning the mathematical theory of black holes, intimately tied to the issue of whether black holes can be real physical objects. They are the questions of rigidity, stability, and collapse. Stability, for example, concerns the question whether small perturbations of the Kerr solutions can grow arbitrarily large. If this were the case it would follow that the Kerr solutions are mathematical artifacts, with no physical reality. It has been conjectured that the Kerr solutions are stable, but despite some very important advances made recently by mathematicians using innovative partial differential equation methods, the problem remains wide open. The rigidity conjecture asserts that the Kerr family of solutions exhausts all possible stationary solutions of the Einstein field equations in vacuum, while the problem of collapse refers to the question of whether black holes can form in time, naturally, from configurations free of such objects. <br/><br/>The project focuses on some of the most important nonlinear hyperbolic equations of mathematical physics. Its main part concerns three related problems in General Relativity at the heart of the theory of black holes: Uniqueness and stability of the Kerr solutions, and formation of black holes. It provides a specific strategy for making progress on the problem of non-linear stability for axially symmetric perturbations of Kerr spacetimes with small angular momentum. In addition, building on recent work on the resolution of the ""Bounded Curvature Conjecture"", the PI intends to continue the search for a scale invariant criterion for well-posedness, i.e., a scale invariant criterion that insures local existence and uniqueness of solutions. This is an important goal not just within General Relativity but for any of the basic hyperbolic equations, in fluids, elasticity, or relativity. The problems under study require new geometric and analytic ideas as well as the development of new techniques."

In order to understand and develop the theory  in Differential Geometry it is necessary to have a sufficient supply of examples of the geometric objects under consideration. Finding such examples is usually a difficult problem. A method which has been very successful because of its generality and flexibility is the gluing methodology for constructing solutions to partial differential equations, using singular perturbations and  known solutions on part of the domain of a problem. Although enormous progress has been made in this direction already, the subject seems to have a long way to go because there are many fundamental questions which are still completely open. Further progress requires much more development of the methodology and application to new questions. The principal investigator plans to continue developing the subject further as discussed next.<br/><br/>First steps in this agenda will concentrate on advancing the principal investigator's program for desingularization and doubling constructions for minimal surfaces in Riemannian manifolds. Other gluing constructions will be pursued with various collaborators: Constructions for Einstein manifolds and Ricci solitons in four dimensions with Simon Brendle and on some projects also with Frederick Fong. Constructions for Constant Mean Curvature hypersurfaces with Christine Breiner. Constructions of special Lagrangian cones with Mark Haskins. On free boundary problems for minimal surfaces in the unit ball with Martin Li.  Constructions for coassociative four-manifolds with Jason Lotay. Constructions for self-shrinkers for the Mean Curvature flow with Stephen Kleene, Niels Moller, and David Wiygul. He also plans to pursue some more collaborations on projects related to doubling and desingularization constructions with Christine Breiner, Jacob Bernstein, Stephen Kleene, F. Martin, W. Meeks, Niels Moller, and David Wiygul. Finally, the principal investigator plans to work, alone or with his collaborators, on some uniqueness/characterization/nonexistence questions related to or motivated by the above constructions."

Distributions are also basic objects in the geometric theory of differential equations and in geometry of real submanifolds of complex spaces (Cauchy-Riemann geometry). The knowledge of invariants of a geometric structure up to diffeomorphisms of the ambient manifolds or, informally speaking, of the quantities which are independent of local coordinate representations of such structures often gives the essential information about various qualitative properties of the geometric structures. In the last decade we developed the novel variational approach for the unified construction of the differential invariants for a very wide class of geometric structures. This approach takes its origin in Optimal Control Theory and Symplectic Geometry. It extends significantly the set of the nonholonomic structures for which the canonical frames and differential invariants can be constructed explicitly and uniformly compared with all previously existing approaches (including the classical Cartan method of equivalence and the Tanaka theory from 1970). The aim of the project is to use these invariants in order to solve a number of natural problems that were not considered in such generality before.  The results of this project will bring new geometric tools for Control Theory and Mathematical Physics by providing efficient and uniform algorithms for computing state-feedback and gauge invariants and explicit geometric optimality conditions for extremals of the corresponding variational problems. We will develop a special MAPLE based software package for computation of our invariants and apply the theory to the qualitative study of control and mechanical systems of practical interest.<br/><br/>The main new point of the aforementioned variational approach is that the study of geometry of nonholonomic structures on manifold can be reduced to a simpler (extrinsic) geometry of curves in flag varieties. In terms of these curves we obtain a new discrete basic invariant of the original structure, called the flag symbol and we have an explicit algorithm for construction of the canonical frame for our original structure that depends only on first fixing this discrete information. However, the main properties of these frames and of the invariants they produce are far of being understood. Among the problems that will be addressed in the project are (1) explicit description of the group of symmetries of the most symmetric models with given flag symbol; (2) exploring when the obtained canonical frames are Cartan connections; (3) distinguishing the fundamental set of invariants among all invariants produced by these frames. To reach these goals we will use various tools and techniques from Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and cohomological theory of Lie algebras. Another main theme of the project is comparison theorems in sub-Riemannian geometry. Several essential differences here compared with the Riemannian case form serious obstacles in obtaining sharp analogs of the classical Rauch and Bonnet-Myers comparison theorems. To overcome these obstacles we propose to work on the infinitesimal version of comparison theorems, i.e.  given a sub-Riemannian metric to describe directions in the tangent space at this metric to the space of all sub-Riemannian metrics in which consecutive conjugate points along the corresponding extremals become closer. We also shall study natural flows on the space of sub-Riemannian metrics along which the infinitesimal comparison theorem holds."

The two-dimensional round sphere in three-dimensional space has positive curvature, of a size that reflects the sense that as one traverses a sphere of large radius, its tangent plane turns more slowly in space than the tangent plane to a sphere of smaller radius: the sphere of radius R has curvature 1/R^2.  Manifolds of curvature greater than or equal to zero have been an active area of study for many years, with most known examples produced by imposing some amount of symmetry, with the sphere and its large group of rotations being the most symmetric example.<br/><br/>These research projects bring homotopy-theoretic tools into the approach of Grove and Ziller to the study of Riemannian manifolds of non-negative curvature.  Some of the questions to be studied follow on well-known theorems and conjectures of Adem, Adams, and Chern.  In particular, a generalization is suggested of Adams' theorem on singly-generated cohomology rings and generalizations in the presence of symmetry for Chern's problem on the fundamental groups of positively curved manifolds are considered."

Evolution by mean curvature has been studied for decades as a natural model for evolving surface interfaces.  Ricci flow describes an evolving geometry, and was used in Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture.  The primary objective of the proposed research on these equations is to study singularities and show that they have a very special form.  Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible, in order to reveal hidden symmetries,  and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist.  This is very useful for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups, and is part of confluence of several research trends over the last 10-15 years.  Another application of similar ideas is to  embedding problems in theoretical computer science: Cheeger, Naor,  and the PI were able to substantially improve the previous best known results on the embedding of spaces of negative type, in connection with the quantitative version of the Goemans-Linial conjecture.<br/><br/>The proposed research is in geometric evolution equations, embedding problems, analysis on metric spaces, and geometric group theory.  The evolution equations in the proposal are mean curvature flow and Ricci flow.  The proposed research in analysis on metric spaces clusters in three areas: (1) bilipschitz embedding problems and related issues, (2) the structure of spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, (3) the structure of boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic spaces.  Common themes in all three areas are spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, and rescaling arguments leading to singular limit spaces."

While many foundational results have been obtained on both flows, a central problem is that in most relevant situations singularities will form. The proposed research of the PI will provide ways to understand these singularities and to continue the flow through them. This will facilitate many new applications both within and outside mathematics.<br/><br/>The proposed research is on mean curvature flow and Ricci flow, with a focus on the formation of singularities and techniques to continue the flow through singularities. In a joint work with Bruce Kleiner, the PI will give a new construction of mean curvature flow with surgery, based on their recent estimates for mean convex flows. The new construction is both more elementary and substantially shorter than prior ones. The PI will apply the mean curvature flow with surgery to topological problems, including a higher dimensional Smale conjecture. In a joint project with Aaron Naber, the PI will prove numerous estimates on path space for the Ricci flow. In fact, an evolving family of Riemannian manifolds satisfies these estimates if and only if it evolves by Ricci flow. Based on this, the PI and Naber will define a notion of weak solutions for the Ricci flow, and develop the theory of these weak solutions."

Conference proceedings will be published in a manner which makes them accessible at low (or no) cost to a wide readership, in order to stimulate further study and research in the rapidly growing area of Poisson geometry.<br/><br/>Poisson Geometry lies at the intersection of Mathematical Physics and Geometry. It originates in the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Poisson structures can be traced back to the 19th century classics by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi and Lie. Poisson Geometry as an independent field started around 1980 with the foundational works of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. The field developed rapidly, stimulated by the connections with a large number of areas in mathematics and mathematical physics, including differential geometry and Lie theory, quantization, noncommutative geometry, representation theory and quantum groups, geometric mechanics and integrable systems. A number of major developments took place in the last 15 years; some of the highlights are Kontsevich's formality theorem, the study of Poisson sigma models and the relationship to the ""integrability problem"" for Lie algebroids, the relation with the moduli space of flat connections and various moment map theories, singular reduction, (generalized) complex geometry, cluster algebras, etc.<br/><br/>Detailed information about Poisson 2014 may be found at<br/><br/>http://www.math.illinois.edu/Poisson2014/"

Graduate students and postdocs will be involved in topics courses taught by postdocs and in the support of research-oriented summer programs for undergraduates. Shorter, immersive summer workshops for graduate students and postdocs will build on the longstanding tradition of the Midwest Topology Seminar and related conferences that regularly bring together researchers throughout the Great Lakes states. Group activities for the academic year include a geometric literacy course that ranges widely in topics, and a topology proseminar.<br/><br/>This research training group aims to achieve a greater integration of fields that have grown apart over the decades and to expose participants to a broader range of potential applications than has been traditional.  Research training will be anchored by research topics ranging broadly through dynamical systems and ergodic theory, a variety of topics in and around geometric group theory, the striking failure of rigidity in arithmetic lattices, homological stability phenomena, and various topics in algebraic topology, from equivariant stable homotopy theory through applied algebraic topology and data analysis."

These can be symmetries that mix different scales (recursive symmetries that describe the growth of trees), or that describe the aggregate behavior of vast numbers of similar objects (ideal gases, efficient markets). A complete understanding of groups is forever beyond our reach -- they exhibit phenomena of arbitrary complexity, and the simplest questions we can ask cannot be answered in the ""worst case.""  But in the *generic* case the situation simplifies enormously. Techniques developed by the principal investigator with his collaborators allow one to construct subgroups of generic groups with a great deal of control, and to certify that these subgroups have any number of desired properties. The aim of this project is to extend these techniques to broader classes of groups, to allow more flexibility in the constructions, and to implement these theoretical tools in practical software. A key idea is to transplant and construct objects from topology and geometry -- namely *hyperbolic* geometry in dimension 2 and 3 -- into the generic combinatorial world, where a priori one would not expect to find them. The familiarity of these transplanted products provides the necessary leverage to break up the ambient group into understandable pieces.<br/><br/>The main aim of this project is to develop tools to construct, to certify and to organize certain classes of quasiconvex subgroups in hyperbolic groups, both in the generic case (i.e. random groups, in various models) and in general.  The subgroups we are concerned with should be groups that we understand (i.e.  fundamental groups of closed surfaces or compact acylindrical 3-manifolds), and their properties in the ambient group should have short certificates (which are the key to their construction in the first place). The principal investigator aims to build on techniques developed with various collaborators to construct such surface subgroups and acylindrical 3-manifold subgroups in various classes of hyperbolic groups, with the view to attacking Gromov's surface subgroup question, and various generalizations and specializations of this question. Techniques developed to construct objects in random groups can be adapted to general hyperbolic groups, where ""randomness"" of the ambient group is substituted for ""degrees of freedom"" in the method of construction. Finally, the author expects to implement these constructions on computer, proving their practical utility as a tool to understand specific classes of groups, beyond the theoretical insights they provide."

An important idea in theoretical physics is the notion of a duality between physical theories. A consequence of such a duality is a deep connection between the mathematical models that describe those theories. These connections allow us to look at a mathematical question in one model from another perspective, and thus derive new results. For this project, the mathematical models come from algebraic geometry (the geometry of sets defined by polynomial equations) and representation theory (the study of symmetry) on the one hand, and symplectic geometry (the geometry of the phase spaces of classical mechanics) on the other. The duality relating them is known as homological mirror symmetry. The focus of this project is to mine this connection for new insights into structures arising on each side of the duality. One part of the project studies how symmetries arise in symplectic geometry, and how this new perspective can give insights into representation theory. Another part studies the relationship between dynamics in symplectic geometry and one of the most basic objects in algebraic geometry, namely functions. The project also supports the training of graduate and early-career mathematicians in this rapidly-developing area of research. More broadly, this project fits into the ongoing interaction between mathematics and physics that has, over the centuries, led to theoretical advances that have enabled the transformative technologies of our time.<br/><br/><br/>The organizing principle for this project is homological mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau varieties (varieties arising as the complement of an anticanonical divisor in a compactification). We consider such varieties both for the algebraic and the symplectic sides of the correspondence. On the symplectic side, the main structure we consider is symplectic cohomology, an algebraic structure that is built out of periodic orbits of certain Hamiltonian flows on a symplectic manifold (hence the connection to dynamics). The heart of the project is to relate this structure to functions and vector fields on the mirror algebraic variety. The connection to representation theory appears by considering the flag variety of a semisimple algebraic group G on the algebraic side. These are not log Calabi-Yau, but they contain open subsets which are, and part of the project is to understand better how to pass between the two situations (this involves considering a potential function on the symplectic side). The symmetries of the flag variety, namely the group G and its Lie algebra, should appear in the symplectic side as well. The natural home for the Lie algebra is symplectic cohomology, and the group action itself is manifested in the action of this Lie algebra on the Floer cohomology of equivariant Lagrangian submanifolds, which are the counterpart of equivariant vector bundles in algebraic geometry. Ultimately, one expects to obtain representations of G in the Lagrangian Floer cohomology groups. The pay-off for this effort is that these Floer cohomology groups come with a distinguished basis, and this project seeks to understand how that basis is related to the various known canonical bases in representation theory of Lusztig, Mirkovic-Vilonen, and others. In approaching these problems, the project uses ideas from the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow approach to mirror symmetry, as developed by Gross-Siebert and Gross-Hacking-Keel, as well as techniques developed by the PI in previous work on the case of log Calabi-Yau surfaces (complex dimension two)."

The principle investigator and collaborators have introduced methodology which, for a significant class of such PDEs, provides better control on the singularities than was previously available. Another theme is to study spaces which can be quite wild (e.g. they can have fractional dimensions) but are nonetheless well enough behaved so that one can employ the methods of calculus, if differentiation is understood in a sufficiently generalized sense. Apart from their intrinsic interest, these methods have had a surprising application to a basic problem in theoretical computer science, the sparsest cut problem with general demands.  <br/><br/><br/>The project focuses on  three main areas: 1) The analytical and geometric structure of metric measure spaces with Lipschitz differentiable structure. 2) Degeneration of Einstein metrics. 3) Quantitative behavior of singular sets. Regarding 1), a basic question is to study the extent to which Lipschitz differentiability spaces are more general than spaces for which the measure satisfies a doubling condition and a Poincar\'e inequality holds in the sense of Heinonen-Koskela. Recent work with Bate characterizing Lipschitz differentiability spaces in terms of Alberti representations should play an important role. Regarding 2), a challenging question is whether for noncollapsed Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Einstein spaces with bounded Einstein constant, the singular set has Hausdorff codimension 4 (as conjectured by M. Anderson).  Regarding 3), a goal is to extend to new cases, the  techniques developed by the principle investigator, with A. Naber (and partly with R. Haslhofer), for studying the quantitative behavior of singular sets of certain elliptic and parabolic PDEs."

Not only is the theory of geometric flows a fundamental subject in mathematics, but it also has potential applications to other scientific fields including computer sciences, material sciences and physics. One of the most important problems in the study of geometric flows is to understand all possible singularities of the flows, which are in turn modeled by self-similar solutions of the flows. The proposed research on the moduli space of such self-similar solutions is expected to broaden and advance the knowledge and techniques both within and outside of mathematics, such as the topology of manifolds, image processing, crystal growths and the large-scale structure of the universe. In the meanwhile, new ideas and tools will be developed in various mathematical disciplines ranging from differential geometry to analysis. In addition, the PI will continue mentoring and organizing seminars and workshops for undergraduates, graduate students and young researchers. The PI will also actively participate in the promotion of women in mathematics to enhance diversity and gender equity in the society.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposed project is to establish various geometric and analytic properties of the space of self-similar solutions of geometric flows. First, the PI, in the continuing collaboration with Brett Kotschwar at the Arizona State University, will apply the Carleman type technique to attack the rigidity problem for noncompact gradient Ricci solitons. Second, appealing to the tools inspired in part by the theory of minimal surfaces, the PI aims to describe a much detailed picture of two-dimensional smooth noncompact self-shrinkers of finite genus of mean curvature flow. To achieve this, the PI will begin with investigating the asymptotic structures at infinity of such self-shrinkers which are conjectured to be regular cones or cylinders. Then the PI intends to address the Cylinder Rigidity Conjecture of Ilmanen concerning the uniqueness of self-shrinking cylinders. At the end, the PI, with Joel Spruck at the Johns Hopkins University, plans to seek the sufficient and necessary conditions of the existence of the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for the self-shrinker equation. Third, in higher dimensions, the PI, joint with Neshan Wickramasekera at the University of Cambridge, will extend the regularity theory of stable minimal submanifolds to derive estimates on the size of singular sets of entropy stable weak self-shrinkers."

The Einstein equation is of fundamental importance in general relativity and Riemannian geometry, and the study of the Einstein equation as a model for gravitational phenomena involves deep relationships between geometric analysis and physics.  Spectacular progress has been made in recent years on several fronts, including the study of wave equations on black hole space-times (with the eventual goal of understanding black hole stability), cosmic censorship, dynamical formation of black holes in vacuum, topology of black holes, and a better understanding of the moduli space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations which govern geometry of initial data for the Cauchy problem.  Recent advances in numerical analysis of gravitational phenomena highlight the need to push the theoretical boundaries of the initial value formulation (both in constructing solutions to the constraints and in understanding the evolution of these initial data sets) and to create a bridge between the researchers in these areas.  The purpose of the summer school is to introduce graduate students and postdocs to the background needed to approach these results and to frame some outstanding open problems in the field. The program will consist of four mini-courses supplemented by several hours of lectures on both introductory and special topics.

It is of crucial importance to recruit and support young talent in the field and, in particular, to bring together students and researchers whose interests span the theoretical to the applied, from geometric analysis to astrophysics and numerical analysis.

These notions are of most fundamental importance in any branch of physics. However, since Einstein's time, there has been great difficulty to find physically acceptable definitions of these concepts for gravitation. The solutions of many unsolved problems such as how a black hole forms and how black holes collide rely essentially on these notions. Recently, the principal investigator and his collaborators successfully discovered definitions for both isolated systems (e.g. when the observer is very far away from a star) and non-isolated systems (e.g. when the observer is at close range with two stars rotating about each other ). The definitions they found satisfy many highly desirable properties, including the first precise dynamical description of Einstein's equation.<br/><br/>This proposal describe plans to further explore these new definitions and their applications. The results obtained in this project are expected to be crucial steps towards deeper understanding of the universe in a large scale.  The principal investigator also proposes to study geometric flows. These are differential equations that model how a geometric shape deforms and evolves to an optimal form in the most efficient way. The proposed research is expected to have applications in general relativity and mathematical physics.  Another line of investigation will study applications of quasi-local mass and quasi-local conserved quantities such as angular momentum and center of mass, which he recently discovered with his collaborators, aiming to anchor and resolve several problems in classical general relativity.  Immediate goals of this proposal include resolving the invariant mass conjecture in general relativity, justification of the definitions of conserved quantities at both the quasi-local and total levels, and applications in the study of the dynamics of the Einstein equation. The principal investigator will also continue his research on inverse mean curvature flows and mean curvature flows.  Immediate goals include the proof of a Gibbons-Penrose inequality in Schwarzschild spacetime and the dynamical stability of the mean curvature flow."

Gardner<br/><br/>Insert abstract here for an award recommendation.<br/><br/>CAT scanners are machines that save lives daily. They take X-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the information to create an image of a two-dimensional section of part of the body. The mathematics behind this process is called computerized tomography. It is very successful, but not perfect; the reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better picture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays, causing greater expense and likelihood of side effects. In geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects are allowed - the density of the object is the same everywhere inside it. An example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney.  One can use this extra information to find better reconstruction procedures.  The scope of geometric tomography is actually much wider. Any measurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered. Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both in mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the geometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside. For example, a new technique called local stereology depends on measurements of planar sections of biological tissue; each section passes through a fixed point, usually the nucleus of a cell, and the measurements can be made optically rather than physically. This project continues the development of several aspects of the mathematics of geometric tomography. Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.<br/><br/>Geometric tomography uses data concerning sections by planes and projections on planes of geometric objects to obtain information about these objects. The latter include general compact sets, but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies, or finite sets. One advantage of this setting is that it becomes more probable that inverse problems have a unique solution.  Generally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of uniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information than would otherwise be possible. This can lead to algorithms that are more effective when few measurements are available, and less sensitive to measurement errors or noise. Geometric tomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry, Minkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will continue the development of geometric tomography. New directions include the investigation of a new operation between sets called M-addition, which includes Minkowski addition and L_p addition as special cases, focusing on applications to valuation theory and polytope theory, as well as the study of M-subtraction, decomposition, and M-zonoids; the development of a new dual Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory and the study of Orlicz intersection bodies; fundamental new classification theorems for binary operations between compact convex sets or star bodies; new classification theorems for Steiner symmetrization and related symmetrization operations; fundamental new classification theorems for binary operations, especially those significant in convex analysis, between functions; and, if time allows, new algorithms for reconstruction of convex bodies from noisy data, in particular, from phase retrieval data, section functions, and lightness functions.

In particular, she intends to quantitatively analyze the interaction between the Q-curvature and the isoperimetric constant. The PI also proposes to study curvature inequalities of different orders for embedded submanifolds. These inequalities, originally considered in the context of convex geometry, have recently known to be valid on a very large class of non-convex domains. The PI's investigation strives to look for the full generality of such inequalities. In the meanwhile, she also aims to develop new skills to understand the corresponding fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations that arise naturally in the problem.<br/><br/>In the proposed study, the PI's research interest lies at the intersection of conformal geometry, the geometry of submanifolds and partial differential equations (PDEs). The study of geometric inequalities and geometric PDEs focuses on conformal invariants, which form an important machinery from physicists' point of view and have found applications to fundamental principles in mathematical physics. The research project to generalize classical results of convex geometry will improve our understanding on the rigidity of the established theory and will shed light on a greatly larger scope of its application."

Usually this equation involves many spatial and temporal variables. Even more, the modeling equation is usually highly nonlinear in form. Although great progress has been made in the past 200 years in developing methods to solve differential equations (as well as in understanding the qualitative nature of the solutions) we are still far from having a complete theory on how to deal with them, and we accept instead a study of particular classes of differential equations. This proposal is concerned with understanding what is known as the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The origin of this equation is both geometric and physical. A famous closely related equation (still not understood completely) is Einstein's field equation from General relativity. The aim of this proposal is to understand this equation from the point of view of geometry and to develop efficient and effective tools from a very different branch of mathematics called algebraic geometry to aid in showing-in concrete cases-that solutions actually exist.<br/><br/>This project brings together several areas of mathematics: classical projective algebraic geometry (Cayley forms and projectively dual varieties), toric varieties and convex polytopes, partial differential equations and coercive estimates for action functionals and a new kind of Geometric Invariant theory discovered by the PI-namely the notion of a semistable pair. The goal is, as suggested in the previous paragraph, to convert the coercive estimate (or lower bound) for the Mabuchi functional into a problem in polyhedral combinatorics and then solve this problem in as many cases as possible. All of this is motivated by the desire to construct canonical metrics on algebraic varieties-usually smooth or with relatively mild singularities."

The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles (the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is less appealing than the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which minimizes the total energy. This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. The projects in this proposal are to define appropriate energies on such spaces, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the research of the PI is, broadly speaking, to use solutions of partial differential equations which are geometric in origin to study properties of differentiable manifolds. The main areas of concentration of the PI's research are the existence of critical metrics generalizing the Einstein condition, the study of quadratic curvature functionals on Riemannian manifolds, the study of critical ALE metrics and orbifolds, and properties of moduli spaces of critical metrics. In joint work with Matt Gursky, the PI has proved existence of critical metrics on various four-manifolds. The proposed research is to further study the properties of the moduli space of such solutions. This is related to orbifold compactness theorems previously studied by Tian-Viaclovsky. The PI has previously demonstrated non-solvability of the Yamabe problem on certain compact orbifolds, which showed that the orbifold Yamabe problem is more subtle than in the case of smooth manifolds. The PI proposes further exploration of this phenomenon, and of connections with the notion of mass of ALE spaces. There has been a considerable amount of research on the existence of anti-self-dual metrics on compact manifolds; they have been shown to exist in abundance. Another goal of the proposal is therefore to understand global properties of the moduli space in certain cases; especially for orbifold-cone anti-self-dual metrics. Finally, the PI is committed to integrating research and education and cultivating intellectual development on many levels. The PI has been active in outreach and organization of conferences in the mathematics community."

A common example is the motion of traveling solitary waves in shallow waters: even though waves tend to travel in families, in shallow waters one can observe solitary waves that travel unchanged, seemly forever, and which are so stable that they are unperturbed by, for example, colliding frontally with another such wave. These are called ""solitons"", and among their equations we have those governing the trailing vortices behind the tips of an airplane, smoke and bubble rings, and others. Solitons are known to have close connections to geometry, with some equations appearing naturally when a certain geometry is present. (Setting an appropriate geometric background is often a fundamental step in the resolution of a problem as a choice of geometry establishes the properties and laws we wish to keep unchanged; like those of a 3D image in a screen.) For example, when working in the projective plane, the natural geometry of a 3D image in a computer, a certain motion of curves will behave as traveling solitary waves, while they would not if considered in the usual Euclidean plane. But images are not continuous curves, they are made of a discrete set of pixels, and the motion of a curve is in fact the motion of a polygon. Reality is discrete, not continuous. In this proposal we will study completely integrable discrete systems associated to motions of polygons in different geometries, including the projective plane. One of the tools we will use are discrete moving frames on lattices, frames of reference that change from vertex to vertex of the lattice, and that has an important role in invariant theory. The continuous theory is widely known, but the discrete one is now being developed. These frames can be applied to a very wide range of problems, including problems in computation and imaging. One of our applications concerns the use of discrete frames to study geometric shapes of blurry images like the ones of a cell obtained through a Cryon-electron microscope.<br/><br/>In this project the principal investigator proposes to research the concept of a discrete moving frame on a lattices, and to investigate its possible applications. She would like to investigate the connection between continuous and discrete versions, together with the relation between evolutions and invariant maps on the space of polygons, on the one hand, and completely integrable lattice systems on the other, including the possible generation of relevant Hamiltonian structures from the difference geometry of the flow. She will also like to investigate the relevance of discrete moving frames to the local difference geometry of lattices and the possibility of applying algebraic methods to produce geometrically significant invariants. Finally, she would like to work on a real life application to study the shape of molecules from the images obtained by Cryon-electron microscopes. The resolution of the proposal could bring parts of Cartans geometry, Lie theory and invariant theory into subjects where the potential of using geometric information is high. These are very rich areas and we are proposing to develop techniques that would make parts of it computationally accessible. The relationship between completely integrable PDEs and the local geometry of curves and surfaces has already been established and many aspects of integrability have a geometric interpretation as evolutions of moving frames, perturbation of curve flows, pull back of Maurer-Cartan connections, etc. To move from here directly to their discretization using difference geometry is not only interesting, but it has the potential of producing integrable discretizations of PDEs and geometrically-relevant algebraic invariants of lattices, among others. The advantages for applied problems are clear: if a problem displays certain symmetries, being able to reduce it to its invariants lowers the dimension and makes them more accessible. This is important not only for image analysis, but also for the analysis of other data."

The subject has developed extremely rapidly in recent years, and this conference will really help engage young researchers.<br/><br/>Over the last several years, a variety of new categorical structures have been discovered by physicists. Furthermore, it has become transparently evident that the higher categorical language is beautifully suited to describing cornerstone concepts in modern theoretical physics. As we head into the second decade of the 21st century, modern geometry and theoretical physics are more intertwined than ever before. The convergence of ideas from mathematics and physics is accelerating at the same time as elementary particle physics is on the cusp of a profound revolution to be brought about by the new experimental results coming out of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These will serve to identify among the multitude of theoretical possibilities currently open, which ones best address quantum field theory at the high energy scale. At the same time, a lot of mathematical work remains to be done to provide a suitable framework for the new physical theories that are being proposed. The geometric objects which we investigate today are the foundations for such a framework: homological mirror symmetry is the mathematical realization of dualities among super-symmetric theories, and higher categories are the mathematical foundation for quantum field theories. These new flavors of geometry, in which categorical structures play a primordial role, will certainly continue to play a fundamental role in 21st century theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The conference website: http://math.berkeley.edu/~auroux/miami2014.html"

Most of the existing literature in geometry deal with non-singular, thus smooth, geometric objects such as a plane, a sphere, a saddle surface and their generalizations. On the other hand, most objects in nature are non-smooth with singularities of varying degrees of complexity. The PI proposes to study certain singular geometric  spaces by analyzing maps  into and  between them that are optimal in the sense that they minimize energy.   From the analysis of these maps, the PI proposes to study  symmetry properties of the singular geometric spaces. Such results are of interest in mathematics and physics and will lead to a greater understanding of the natural world.<br/><br/><br/>A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces is defined by measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain and then integrating. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional. They can be seen as both a generalization of harmonic functions in complex analysis and a higher dimensional analogue of parameterized geodesics in Riemannian geometry. Next to totally geodesic maps, harmonic maps are perhaps the most natural way to map a given geometric space into another. In this proposal, the PI proposes to extend the harmonic map theory for singular geometry and apply it to solve problems in other fields. When studying harmonic maps, natural questions that arise are: Under what conditions are harmonic maps regular? If it is not regular, what is the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set? Is the singular set rectifiable? We consider these questions in the singular setting (i.e. the domain and/or target space of a harmonic map not necessarily a smooth Riemannian manifold). By gaining a better understanding of these issues, we realize the potential applications of harmonic maps in the singular setting that include rigidity problems in geometric group theory and understanding degeneration of hyperbolic structures."

This is accomplished through a series of mini-courses taught by leading researchers, who aim their lectures at the appropriate level.  The second goal is to broadly disseminate current advances in these areas by hosting a conference in the final week of the program.   The Center also seeks to increase the diversity of the mathematical work force by actively recruiting underrepresented groups to attend the activities.  This grant supports the programs planned at the Center for the next three summers.<br/><br/>The program in 2014 will be dedicated to Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics.

The goal of the Program in Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics is to bring together researchers who are working on PDEs with connections to differential geometry and mathematical physics.  The program in 2015 will be dedicated to Boundaries and Dynamics.  In recent years a number of problems and techniques have used statistical properties of a group action on an object at infinity which can be considered as a boundary. The goal of the Program on Boundaries and Dynamics is to explore themes involving a notion of boundaries in geometry and ergodic theory.  The program in 2016 will be dedicated to Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics.  The last few years have also seen a remarkable convergence of ideas in model theory, combinatorics, Lie groups, number theory, and dynamics. The main goal of the Program on Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics is to facilitate interactions between mathematicians working in these related areas."

Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness. Its importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by the French mathematician Poincare, during his investigation of the laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to Newton's laws.  In the past twenty years, topology has seen applications in questions such as the knotting of proteins and DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The topology of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher dimension, is of particular subtlety. Graph theory also has a long history. It is the mathematical theory of networks and their connections, and sees application in many aspects of computer science, algorithms and optimization. By viewing networks as embedded in three-dimensional space, this project aims to use techniques from topology to study questions in graph theory. The topological techniques will be drawn from many sources, but particularly from gauge theory, a field having its origins in fundamental physics. The project will deepen our understanding of topology and its interaction with other areas of mathematics and science.

This will be defined using a gauge theory related to representations of the fundamental group of the graph's complement in the group of rotations, SO(3). This SO(3) instanton homology will be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field of two elements. A proof will be completed, that the dimension of the SO(3) instanton homology is always non-zero, for any bridgeless, spatial trivalent graph. The PI will investigate the dimension of the SO(3) instanton homology for general planar trivalent graphs. It is expected that the dimension is always related to the number of three-edge-colorings of the graph. If the previous two goals are achieved, it will follow that every bridgeless, planar trivalent graph admits at least one three-edge-coloring, a major result in the field. Instanton homology theories for trivalent graphs defined using larger gauge groups such as SU(N) will be investigated as part of this project. The SU(3) case is expected to play a role in understanding the SO(3) instanton homology. Relations will be explored, between SU(N) instanton homology and categorifications of quantum invariants, such as Khovanov-Rozansky homology."

Moreover, the proposal seeks to solidify and provide accessible expositions of the differential-topological foundations for regularizations of moduli spaces of elliptic PDEs.<br/><br/>The research projects described in this proposal concern symplectic geometry, the geometric structure that lies behind the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics. Recent applications of ideas from symplectic geometry include invariants that help to distinguish one (three or) four-dimensional space from another. Broader impacts of this project concentrate on promoting women in mathematics, e.g. by continuing a lecture series by accomplished researchers and expositors, named after Dorothy Weeks, the first female graduate from the MIT math department."

However, the theory for degenerate partial differential equations is not well developed due to the complexity of the degeneracy. It is a common phenomenon that degeneracy causes a loss of derivatives for solutions. One of the central tasks is to identify optimal conditions under which classical solutions exist and possess nice properties. Such a task is reflected in all proposed problems. Our goal is to search for techniques to establish a priori estimates for perspective solutions under these optimal conditions. Breakthrough in this direction will have broad impacts to the whole field of degenerate partial differential equations and their applications.<br/><br/>The investigator will carry out several research projects studying degenerate differential equations from Riemannian and complex geometry and general relativity. These include the study of Abreu's equations and extremal metrics on toric varieties, study of the generalized Jang equation and the Penrose inequality, investigation of the isometric embedding of closed surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and investigation of boundary behavior of minimal surfaces in the hyperbolic space. The main objectives are to understand the impact of the degeneracy on properties of solutions and to investigate the behavior of solutions near the sets of degeneracy. The discussion of the proposed mathematical problems will improve our understanding of more complicated degenerate partial differential equations in various applications."

Additionally, both pre- and post-conference events will be held in Vancouver, Edmonton, and Banff.  The week before SMC 2014, a String-Math Summer School will be held at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.  The week following SMC 2014 features two Satellite Workshops in Alberta: ""Calabi-Yau Manifolds and their Moduli"" at the University of Alberta and ""Quantum Curves and Quantum Knot Invariants"" at the Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery (BIRS).  The String-Math Conferences are a series of large meetings bringing together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory.  The nature of interactions between mathematicians and physicists has been thoroughly transformed in recent years.  String theory, as well as quantum field theory, has contributed a series of profound ideas which gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones.  By now there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and physicists working at the string-theoretic interface between the two academic fields.  The influence flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and ideas contributing crucially to major advances in string theory.<br/><br/>For mathematics, string theory has been a source of many significant inspirations, ranging from Seiberg-Witten theory in four-manifolds, to enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry, to work on the Jones polynomial in knot theory, to advances in symplectic topology, to recent progress in the geometric Langlands program and the development of derived algebraic geometry and n-category theory.  In the other direction, mathematics has provided physicists with powerful tools, ranging from powerful differential geometric techniques for solving or analyzing key partial differential equations, to toric geometry, to K-theory and derived categories in D-branes, to the analysis of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string compactifications, to the use of modular forms and other arithmetic techniques.  This mutual interaction has enhanced the depth, power, and novelty of the results obtained in both fields.  This award provides partial support for travel and lodging to advanced students and postdoctoral participants.  Participation of young researchers and those from underrepresented groups is actively encouraged.  The results presented at the conference will be disseminated through a conference web site <br/><br/>https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/stringmath2014/<br/><br/>and through the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences online video archive <br/><br/>www.mathtube.org<br/><br/>which will host video recordings of the talks, slides, and notes."

Not only is the theory of geometric flows a fundamental subject in mathematics, but it also has potential applications to other scientific fields including computer sciences, material sciences and physics. One of the most important problems in the study of geometric flows is to understand all possible singularities of the flows, which are in turn modeled by self-similar solutions of the flows. The proposed research on the moduli space of such self-similar solutions is expected to broaden and advance the knowledge and techniques both within and outside of mathematics, such as the topology of manifolds, image processing, crystal growths and the large-scale structure of the universe. In the meanwhile, new ideas and tools will be developed in various mathematical disciplines ranging from differential geometry to analysis. In addition, the PI will continue mentoring and organizing seminars and workshops for undergraduates, graduate students and young researchers. The PI will also actively participate in the promotion of women in mathematics to enhance diversity and gender equity in the society.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposed project is to establish various geometric and analytic properties of the space of self-similar solutions of geometric flows. First, the PI, in the continuing collaboration with Brett Kotschwar at the Arizona State University, will apply the Carleman type technique to attack the rigidity problem for noncompact gradient Ricci solitons. Second, appealing to the tools inspired in part by the theory of minimal surfaces, the PI aims to describe a much detailed picture of two-dimensional smooth noncompact self-shrinkers of finite genus of mean curvature flow. To achieve this, the PI will begin with investigating the asymptotic structures at infinity of such self-shrinkers which are conjectured to be regular cones or cylinders. Then the PI intends to address the Cylinder Rigidity Conjecture of Ilmanen concerning the uniqueness of self-shrinking cylinders. At the end, the PI, with Joel Spruck at the Johns Hopkins University, plans to seek the sufficient and necessary conditions of the existence of the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for the self-shrinker equation. Third, in higher dimensions, the PI, joint with Neshan Wickramasekera at the University of Cambridge, will extend the regularity theory of stable minimal submanifolds to derive estimates on the size of singular sets of entropy stable weak self-shrinkers."
