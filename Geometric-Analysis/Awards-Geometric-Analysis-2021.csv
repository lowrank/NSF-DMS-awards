A prototypical example is the spacetime which unifies the three dimensions of physical space and the one dimension of time into a four-dimensional system such that where and when events occur can be studied in clean and effective framework of mathematics. It is indicated by Einstein's general relativity theory that, as a source of gravitation, the spacetime is not flat. How the spacetime is curved can be precisely determined by a system of curvature equations, namely, the Einstein equations. Broadly speaking, this project centers on the relationship between the curvature of a space and the geometry on it. The latter, geometry in our context, consists of both local and global aspects. The local geometry refers to the concrete and rigid shape of a space at small scales, while the global geometry or topology focuses on the profiles at large scales which are invariant under continuous transformations. It is a fundamental principle that geometric complications of a space always correspond to the analytic singularity behaviors of the solution to the Einstein equation. The central part of this project is dedicated to the development of new tools and techniques in understanding the Einstein equation, which reflects substantially new geometric structures of the underlying space. In addition to pursuing open and fundamental problems at the forefront in differential geometry, this project also contributes to establishing correspondence between the new developed geometric structures and the conjectural principles in physical disciplines such as quantum field theory and string theory. <br/><br/>This project is concerned with a family of Einstein manifolds collapsing to a lower dimensional metric space. Together with Aaron Naber, the PI obtained a new flavor of regularity and structure theorem for collapsing Einstein spaces. The PI will continue this project to explore the structure of the singular sets and classifying bubbles for collapsing spaces. Besides studying general collapsing theory, joint with Song Sun, the PI will construct a large variety of new collapsed Einstein spaces in any dimension, which will predict new phenomena especially for higher dimensional geometries. In higher dimensions, the wild geometric nature of the limiting singular set and the lack of effective regularity theory would constitute essential difficulties in analysis and in the construction procedure. The new tools and techniques in the construction are expected more interesting than the problem itself, which will generate many problems and new directions to study. In another line of investigation, the PI will address issues involving collapsing Einstein 4-manifolds with Kaehler structures. Joint with Gao Chen and Jeff Viaclovsky, the PI will address issues involving elliptic K3 surfaces. The first part of this direction would study the metric characterizations of K3 surfaces with generic elliptic fibrations. Specifically, the PI and his collaborators will geometrically identify the bubbles and quantitatively describe the metric behaviors in each class of elliptic K3 surfaces, which would essentially connect the geometric collapsing and algebraic degeneration in an effective way. In the second part, with Hans-Joachim Hein, Song Sun and Jeff Viaclovsky, the PI have managed to construct a family of collapsed Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces which collapse to a closed interval, which in effect gives a metric-geometric description for the Type II complex structures degeneration of polarized K3 surfaces in algebraic geometry. Based on the new metric constructions, the PI and his collaborators will continue this program with a specific goal to understand the boundary structure of the moduli space of the K3 surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space that are invariant under continuous stretching or bending of a space. Geometry involves understanding distances. For example, if the surface of our planet is viewed as a sphere one can measure distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles. One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. There are many ways to make this notion precise in terms of minimizing a total energy measurement. This idea can be generalized to higher dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them that use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. These projects will define appropriate energies on such spaces, and seek out the important optimal geometries that minimize the total energy. The PI will participate in mentoring, outreach and organization of conferences in the mathematics community.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this research will use solutions of partial differential equations, which are geometric in origin to study properties of differentiable manifolds. The main areas of concentration of the PI's research are the study of gravitational instantons in dimension four (both compact and complete non-compact), the study of collapsing sequences Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces, the construction of a global moduli space of scalar-flat Kahler ALE metrics, and the study of the orbifold Yamabe problem. In ongoing work with Hein, Sun, and Zhang, the PI has constructed new examples of Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces, which collapse to an interval, with Heisenberg nilmanifolds occurring as fibers in the regular collapsing regions. In this case, gravitational instantons of type ALH-star bubble off, and it is of interest to have a better understanding of this class of instantons. In joint work with Chen and Zhang, the PI has constructed examples of collapsing sequences of Ricci-flat metrics on the K3 surface that has both ALG and ALG-star bubbles, and it is also of interest to have a better understanding of these types of instantons, which have quadratic volume growth. In joint work with Han, the PI will conduct further study of the moduli space of scalar-flat Kahler ALE metrics for certain groups at infinity and finding new examples of such metrics on non-Artin components of deformations of isolated quotient singularities. In joint work with Ju, the PI is studying compactness and existence results for the orbifold Yamabe problem, which differs substantially from the smooth case due to the failure of the positive mass theorem for ALE metrics. Finally, the PI is committed to integrating research and education and cultivating intellectual development on many levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scalar curvature is the simplest curvature invariant of a Riemannian manifold. It represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. Scalar curvature also arises in natural sciences. For instance, in general relativity, it is the Lagrangian density of the Einstein-Hilbert action. A natural and deep question in geometry, topology and mathematical physics is to understand the affect of scalar curvature conditions on a manifold. The other main area of investigation concerns minimal surfaces. Minimal surfaces arise as the mathematical model of a number of interfaces in nature. In mathematical model of general relativity, minimal surfaces occur as ?apparent horizons? of black holes; soap films and capillary interfaces also provide examples of minimal surfaces. The PI will investigate the existence, regularity and topology of minimal surfaces. The two aspects proposed here are deeply connected via geometric variational theory.<br/><br/>The project concerns a range topics on differential geometry, geometric measure theory and partial differential equations. A main theme of the research in geometry will be a geometric comparison theorem for scalar curvature using Riemannian polyhedra, with the aim to define weak notions of positive scalar curvature on spaces with low regularity. The PI plans to continue his investigations into such a theorem for more general polytopes, especially simplexes of higher dimensions, and its connection to quasi-local mass in general relativity. The PI also plans to continue his investigation on the structure of moduli spaces of manifolds with positive scalar curvature and mean convex boundary, including studying its high homotopy groups, and the structure of moduli spaces defined by other related curvature conditions. In addition, the PI will study singular spaces with scalar curvature lower bounds, and understand when such a singular manifold arises as a certain limit of smooth manifolds with same assumptions. A central tool in the PI?s research is the theory of minimal varieties. The PI plans to understand the existence and regularity of minimal surfaces with free boundary and capillary boundary conditions in general Lipschitz domains, especially in locally convex polyhedral domains. He also plans to establish a general existence theory of capillary surfaces via a min-max construction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems are fundamental across the sciences, but the mathematics underlying their study is very difficult, many important questions remain open, and new ideas are needed.  A main theme of this project is to use a geometric approach to bring fresh insight to this field.  Recently, the PI and collaborators used techniques from symplectic geometry to settle a longstanding question about certain dynamical systems. They showed that a particular dynamical system would take an infinite amount of energy to produce and used this to establish a new dichotomy in the set of systems: the finite-energy ones, and the rest.  This dichotomy will enable a deeper understanding of the classification of dynamical systems and should allow for the resolution of several questions that have attracted wide interest.  This project involves further research in this direction.  One goal of the project is to find a further dichotomy for the finite-energy systems.  By bringing a geometric approach to bear on questions about dynamical systems that have resisted solution by other methods, the project aims to showcase the power of these kinds of techniques.  At the same time, an idea at the heart of the approach comes from studying when one symplectic shape can be deformed into a subset of another, and research in these directions should deepen our understanding of symplectic geometry.  The project also has a substantial education component.  The PI has previously worked to broaden participation in mathematics, foster equity, and support educational efforts in the field through prison education, research training in geometry at the high school and undergraduate levels, and course design.  The project supports this work and related activities.     <br/><br/>This project involves a series of research investigations touching on the related fields of symplectic dynamics, symplectic embeddings, and continuous symplectic geometry.  The main emphasis is on questions in low dimensions where powerful gauge theoretic techniques are available. The PI and collaborators recently settled the longstanding ""Simplicity Conjecture"" partly by contributing to the theory of periodic Floer homology spectral invariants. The project aims to further develop this theory and solve several longstanding questions; for example, to prove an analogue of the Simplicity Conjecture in higher genus.  The project also aims to clarify the dynamics of Reeb flows, study infinite staircases in symplectic embedding problems, investigate questions about topological symplectic manifolds, and study higher-dimensional symplectic packing problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this research program is to understand how properties of these functions depend upon the underlying geometry of the space being studied. The project includes two main educational efforts. The first is the creation of working groups for incoming graduate students; its goal is to prepare the students to develop a strong set of skills to apply for grants and to prepare them for teaching. The second is the development of online materials for a course on semiclassical analysis that will be available for students to use whenever the in-person version of the course is not offered.  <br/><br/>Understanding the behavior of Laplace eigenfunctions is of fundamental importance in mathematical physics and has been studied since the 1700s. In particular, the challenging study of concentration properties of high energy eigenfunctions has been the subject of extensive work, and the tools developed for studying Laplace eigenfunctions have had a profound impact on nearly every area of spectral theory and geometric analysis. This project concerns a framework developed by the investigator to extract information on the structure of eigenfunctions from their concentration and propagation behavior in phase space via the use of semiclassical analysis. The current research aims to adapt and develop these methods to reach a deeper understanding of eigenfunction behavior by studying their pointwise growth, L^p-norms, associated two-point Weyl Laws, and applications to random waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This geometric theory of gravity proposed by Einstein is fundamental to our understanding of the large scale structure of the universe, and has many practical applications such as to the fine tuning of global positioning system (GPS) technology. The PI will seek to establish families of geometric inequalities relating mass, charge, angular momentum, and horizon area, which probe the grand weak cosmic censorship conjecture. This conjecture asserts that whenever singularities arise in spacetime (which is a generic phenomenon) they must always be shrouded inside a black hole event horizon; this is intimately tied to whether general relativity is a proper deterministic theory. Special black hole solutions with symmetry (referred to as stationary axisymmetric and electro-vacuum) play a large role in our understanding of the theory, and this project seeks to classify them in higher dimensions relevant to string theory. Furthermore, new criteria for gravitational collapse and black hole formation will be studied, and the PI will also examine proposed definitions of quasi-local mass in order to determine whether they are mathematically and physically viable. Lastly, fundamental questions concerning the shape (topology) of the cosmos will be addressed, including whether we live in a finite or infinite universe.<br/><br/>Recently the PI, in collaboration with Bray, Kazaras, and Stern has found a new and simple proof of the positive mass theorem, a result which has played a seminal role in mathematical relativity since its initial proof by Schoen, Yau, and Witten 40 years ago. This new approach, which has also been generalized to the spacetime and hyperbolic settings, yields an explicit lower bound for the mass in terms of quantities associated with (spacetime) harmonic functions, and suggests a strategy to establish the conjectured stability or almost rigidity for this theorem. Based on an initial collaboration with Bray, the PI has completed a systematic approach to treating the full family of Penrose-type inequalities by reducing each to a canonical system of elliptic PDE, thus placing the entire range of these geometric inequalities within reach. Together with Yamada and Weinstein, who initiated the study of harmonic maps with prescribed singularities associated with the axisymmetric 4D Einstein equations in the 1990s, the PI has developed the tools necessary to substantially generalize the 4D results to allow for exotic topologies in higher dimensions as well as a wide range of symmetric space targets. This work suggests that it is possible to obtain the full classification of stationary axisymmetric black holes within vacuum and supergravity. In joint work with Alaee and Yau, the PI has begun a study of the proposed Bekenstein bounds based on the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass; these inequalities concern the entropy/information contained within a relativistic body and have wide ranging implications from thermodynamics to computer science. This initial study has provided the foundations to address the full Bekenstein conjecture, and is closely related via the approach to the trapped surface/hoop conjecture dealing with the conditions under which black holes may form. In addition, joint work with Anderson has established what may be considered as the first step of Bartnik's minimal mass extension conjecture, and the PI's methods indicate what should be a successful strategy for the remaining parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two key notions in differential geometry, besides ""length"" and ""angle,"" are: ""minimal surfaces,"" which generalize the concept of a straight line, and ""curvature,"" which measures how a surface is bent. The early development of differential geometry is partly attributable to physics. In the early 20th century, Einstein formulated a geometric theory of gravitation, general relativity, asserting that we live in a curved four-dimensional world (""spacetime"") where energy and mass are manifestations of the curvature of spacetime, and minimal surfaces are indicative of black hole boundaries. Nowadays, differential geometry and minimal surfaces are at the heart of several physical theories and active mathematical research directions. The principal investigator (PI) will study problems regarding minimal surfaces that are motivated by general relativity and by the van der Walls--Cahn--Hilliard theory of phase transitions for multicomponent alloy systems. This project will also support the proposer's efforts to promote student learning, inclusion, and training through summer schools, workshops, and conferences, as well as via expository articles and notes.<br/><br/>This project spans three related active research areas of minimal surface theory in differential geometry. First, the PI will investigate the construction of minimal surfaces as limiting min-max phase transitions. This construction has been recently shown to exhibit certain desirable stability properties that led to the proof of the ""multiplicity one min-max conjecture"" in three dimensions by the PI and Chodosh. The PI will continue this program, to produce surfaces with different curvatures and in different dimensions, as well as to better understand geometric implications of stable phase transitions. Second, as a step toward understanding limits of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, the PI will study smooth and non-smooth three- and four-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature via the inherent bending effects of their embedded minimal surfaces. Third, the PI will apply this study of bending effects of minimal surfaces to investigate conjectured relationships between different mass notions in general relativity, where time-symmetric initial data sets are precisely manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geometric objects, similar to the objects we see around us, can possess edges and vertices (such as a square), but can be so much more complicated (for example, possessing a fractal structure). Problems of this nature arise in many engineering/designing problems (such as the designing of antenna reflector) in addition to many other areas out of mathematics (such as economics). Moreover, these problems are well connected with other areas of mathematics, including PDE and functional analysis. Another benefit of these problems is that in various special cases, they are visually understandable and solvable by motivated undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The recently posed dual Minkowski problem and Lp dual Minkowski problem are two Minkowski-type problems that received much attention. The principal investigator, through collaboration, has gained a good understanding of the solutions when one assumes origin-symmetry of the data and the convex body. There, the final solutions depend very much on convex bodies with non-smooth boundaries. An understanding in the non-symmetric case is imperative and is one of the goals. The challenge is to identify and solve the proper optimization problem. Another goal is to understand how an optimization problem involving two bodies can help in this setting. The same phenomenon can be observed when one considers the antenna reflector design problem with decay. The Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality is one of the deepest results in convex geometry and emcompasses many isoperimetric inequalities. The equality condition remains quite mysterious as even in the simple cases, bodies with fractal boundary structures can arise as extremal cases.

Classical examples are minimal surfaces, which locally minimize area subject to fixed boundary conditions, such as soap films supported by wires of various shapes. This project studies constant mean curvature (CMC) and minimal surfaces as well as harmonic maps. CMC surfaces optimize area, but with constraint given by enclosed volume -- CMC surfaces appear in nature as soap bubbles. Harmonic maps optimize energy rather than area and are closely related to minimal surfaces. The objects studied in this project have characterizations in many branches of mathematics; the questions and desired results are of broad interest in mathematics and beyond.<br/><br/>This research project primarily studies CMC surfaces immersed in smooth manifolds and harmonic maps into metric spaces. In the work on harmonic maps, the project aims to provide a new direction for resolution of Cannon's conjecture. It is planned to establish the existence of a harmonic homeomorphism from the round unit sphere into a sphere with a metric possessing upper curvature bounds. In a second direction, the project aims to refine techniques that produced a compactness theory for harmonic maps into metric spaces with upper curvature bounds. While the techniques for proving compactness in this setting are necessarily geometric and variational (rather than analytic), the results are analogous to those that establish compactness in the smooth setting. Using the refined techniques, the investigator plans to establish a harmonic replacement argument using energy rather than modulus of continuity methods. Other research directions relate to the study of CMC surfaces. The investigator plans to extend and refine a gluing construction that produced CMC hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. The new construction is expected to produce non-rotational, toroidal drops in Euclidean space and will serve as a model for a subsequent construction to produce CMC tori in three-manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader impacts of this project lie in the professional development of the PI's graduate students and postdocs, the dissemination of research through talks and the Northwestern Geometry/Physics seminar, and through the PI's many outreach activities.<br/><br/>A common thread within the project is an understanding of a moduli space of objects in a category defined by a Legendrian subspace.

Modern mathematics makes use of powerful analytic tools such as calculus to study geometry, which creates the field differential geometry. Differential geometry has been one of the most active fields in mathematics, with interconnections and applications to other mathematical fields like topology and differential equations, and also with physics - in Einstein's theory of relativity, gravity is the curvature of a metric. This project investigates the complex aspects of differential geometry, especially the important metrics on complex spaces called invariant metrics, with tools from complex analysis and differential equations. A main goal is to understand the shape or curvature of the invariant metrics, and their underlying mathematical structures. This study of complex geometry interplays with the algebraic sides of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, representation theory, and number theory, and has applications to physics such as string theory and to scientific computing via conformal maps. The project includes training through research involvement for graduate students.<br/><br/>There are four classical invariant metrics on complex manifolds, the Bergman metric, the Caratheodory-Reiffen metric, the Kobayashi-Royden metric, and the complete Kähler-Einstein metric with negative scalar curvature. They are invariant under biholomorphisms, and hence depend only on the underlying complex structure of the complex manifold. The study of invariant metrics give rise to intriguing connections between differential geometry, several complex variables, topology, nonlinear partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry. For instance, the invariant metrics are closely related to several long-standing conjectures such as that a simply-connected, negatively curved, complete Kähler manifold must be biholomorphic to a bounded complex Euclidean domain. The Kähler-Einstein metric and the Kobayashi-Royden metric play key roles in understanding the positivity of canonical bundle. Combining methods from partial differential equations and several complex variables, the project aims to provide deeper understanding on the geometry of the invariant metrics, for a large class of complex manifolds, including complete noncompact Kähler manifolds, compact complex manifolds, and quasi-projective manifolds.

In mathematics, certain geometric shapes with these additional structures are known as symplectic or contact manifolds. Solutions of classical mechanical systems can be interpreted in terms of flow lines of mathematical objects known as Hamiltonian or Reeb vector fields on a symplectic or contact manifold, respectively.  Understanding the evolution and distinguishing transformations of these systems led to the development of global invariants of symplectic and contact structures, which shed light on the interconnectedness of dynamics, geometry, and topology. The PI plans to build on her work in providing foundations and applications of contact invariants.  The PI will continue and expand her efforts to increase the access and success of underrepresented students in pure and applied mathematics. With the Rice Association for Women in Mathematics Chapter, she plans to organize a weekly Math Night at Rice University.

These flows are characterized by the deformation of geometric objects such as metrics, mappings, and submanifolds by geometric quantities such as curvature and consist of partial differential equations of parabolic type. Geometric flows appear in many real world applications. For example, surface tension along moving interfaces in fluids and materials is proportional to mean curvature; mean curvature flow and affine mean curvature flow are useful for image processing. However, studying geometric equations can be challenging due to nonlinearities and the possible development of singularities, especially topological changes. One way to understand those singularities is to zoom in and understand how solutions look as they approach the singular time after which a smooth solution no longer exists. During this limiting process we get special solutions to a geometric equation that are called ancient solutions, which have existed for an infinite amount of time in the past. Understanding those solutions could be useful in obtaining more topological and geometric information about a geometric object. The project will also include training of students and the mentoring of junior researchers.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is the classification of ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows, such as, the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. This project will combine the PDE techniques and geometric estimates to study ancient solutions of these flows. The goal is to classify ancient closed noncollapsed solutions to higher dimensional Ricci flow (cases n = 2, 3 have been solved), under the assumption that solution becomes asymptotically cylindrical as time approaches minus infinity. One motivation for this classification comes from showing an analogue of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Theorem for the Ricci flow. This could potentially enable us to perform surgery in the Ricci flow in higher dimensions without assuming global curvature conditions initially. As a continuation of a completed project with collaborators, PI will investigate noncollapsed ancient solutions to the mean curvature flow that are asymptotic to other generalized round cylinders besides the well understood case of a round cylinder.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A flow of principal concern for this project is the Mean Curvature Flow, characterized by the property that it evolves a surface so that its area decreases as rapidly as possible. Geometric flows have extensive applications to various physical problems. For instance, mean curvature flow occurs in the description of the evolution of interfaces arising in several multiphase physical models. Moreover, it is used in material science to model cell, grain and bubble growth. Geometric flows have also proven to have extremely useful geometric applications, specifically classification theorems and geometric inequalities. This project will focus on ancient solutions to mean curvature flow, these being solutions that have existed for all times in the past. A large and important class of these solutions has hitherto resisted attempts at elucidation, but a new method of constructing, studying and classifying them will be brought to bear.  The project also includes training of graduate students as well as the organization of workshops and summer schools to help create opportunities for students to be exposed to new developments in geometric analysis.<br/><br/>Ancient solutions have an important role in the study of singularities; these constitute an obstruction to the existence for all times of the flow, and it is therefore of major interest to understand their geometry and behavior.  As is typically the case in mathematics, focus has to be narrowed to some extent in order to obtain satisfying answers. Therefore this project will focus on ancient solutions to mean curvature flows that are confined to slab regions.  This project will construct, in all dimensions, a large family of new examples, both symmetric and asymmetric; the project will also construct many eternal examples which are not of the standard kind that evolve by translation.  Additionally, the project proposes a novel way of classifying such solutions.  Finally, the project plans to apply results to the non-collapsed setting to obtain properties of entire solutions.  Looking further ahead, there is strong evidence that these methods apply to a much wider class of geometric flows.

In the last few decades, this conversation has led to a fruitful exchange centered on the role of higher algebra (such as category theory and homotopical algebra) in quantum field theory (QFT). It has transformed and enlarged our view of QFT, and thus it plays an active role not only in the farther reaches of particle theory, but also in the concrete discoveries of condensed matter physics, notably in topological states and phases of matter. A recent innovation from this exchange is factorization algebras, which appear naturally in physics as the observables of field theories (both classical and quantum) but originally appeared in mathematics. This project explores the power of this tool  in the setting of 4-dimensional gauge theories. To pursue goals of this research, the Principal Investigator will collaborate with both mathematicians and physicists. This kind of interdisciplinary effort is an inspiring and motivating aspect of this area of research,  but effective communication is often difficult because, despite the long-running relationship of mathematics and physics, each community has its own prerogatives and modes of discourse. A key component of this project is thus to offer chances for researchers at all levels to become fluent in speaking to both disciplines and, moreover, to build direct personal bridges. At the graduate and postdoctoral level, the project will run annual summer schools for both mathematicians and theoretical physicists, focused on topics of mutual interest. In addition, each academic year, it will produce high-quality, online masterclasses by experts about such topics, with lecture notes and exercises.

The long-term target is a holomorphic version of Seiberg duality (arising from N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories), which bears natural analogies to mirror symmetry. This first project uses a toolkit, developed by the PI with collaborators, for constructing BV quantization of holomorphic field theories and then analyzing their factorization algebras of observables. The second focus involves topological theories on manifolds with boundaries and corners, where the long-term target is a rigorous demonstration of the Frenkel-Gaiotto conjecture about how vertex algebras and ribbon categories arise from the Kapustin-Witten gauge theories, which play a key role in the physical approach to the geometric Langlands correspondence. This second project will approach the conjecture using both global methods (by developing, via derived algebraic geometry, the AKSZ procedure with manifolds with boundaries and corners, and thence a higher categorical deformation quantization) and perturbative methods (building upon an extension of the BV/factorization package for field theories on manifolds with boundary, which yields stratified factorization algebras of observables).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase the difficulty of sampling, and computation goes up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases that are not visible in low dimensions.  We can exploit those patterns thus taking advantage of the ""curse of dimensionality"" to make it the ""blessing of dimensionality"".  It is one purpose of these projects to study such high dimensional phenomena.<br/><br/>These projects are in asymptotic geometric analysis and affine convex geometry.  Of particular interest are the affine invariant functionals on convex bodies in high dimensions. Among the most important such functionals are affine surface area and p-affine surface area. Their corresponding affine isoperimetric inequalities, established by the principal investigator and collaborators for all p, are stronger than their Euclidean counterparts and related to the famous Mahler conjecture which is still open in dimensions four and higher. p-affine surface areas are directly related to entropies of cone measures of convex bodies which establishes a link between convex geometry and information theory. This link will be further explored, also in the context of log concave functions which are a natural extension of convex bodies in the realm of functions.  Moreover, affine surface area appears naturally in questions on approximation of convex bodies by polytopes, a further main topic of study.  The goal is to establish optimal dependence on all the relevant parameters involved in the approximation, like e.g., dimension, the number of vertices of the approximating polytopes.  These issues will be considered in Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic space.

A classical example of a spectrum is a Laplacian spectrum.  It is a sequence of numbers encoding the information about many physical properties of an object such as elasticity, heat and sound propagations and many others.  More specifically, this project deals with the spectral geometry of special shapes such as soap films. The geometry of soap films is a central subject of modern geometric analysis with applications far beyond the one suggested by their name, most prominently to mathematical theory of general relativity.  Spectral geometry of soap films is an exciting novel area of research on the interface of spectral theory and geometry.  The inherent interdisciplinary nature of this field results in a fruitful exchange of ideas between spectral theory and geometric analysis. The goal of the project is to further develop the techniques and ideas introduced the recent years, to investigate their applications beyond spectral geometry and to interest young researchers in this new promising subject. The project also includes summer research opportunities for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The project is devoted to the study of sharp isoperimetric inequalities for eigenvalues of natural geometric operators on manifolds.  The underlying principle of the field is the correspondence between optimal metrics for such inequalities and minimal submanifolds.  As a result, a variety of methods can be applied to this problem and advances in the field often result in interesting information on the geometry of minimal submanifolds.  The following four problems are identified as the focus of the project.  The first goal is to extend PI?s prior results on the explicit form of the sharp isoperimetric inequality for all Laplacian eigenvalues on the projective plane to the case of more complicated surfaces, starting with a torus.  The second project will study the regularity and stability of optimal metrics.  This will be achieved using the energy min-max characterization of the optimal eigenvalue inequalities obtained in collaboration with D. Stern.  The third goal is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of optimal metrics for the first Steklov eigenvalue as the number of boundary components becomes unbounded.  Numerical simulations predict that a novel geometric phenomenon manifests itself in this regime: the corresponding free boundary minimal surfaces converge to a closed minimal surface in the boundary. The aim is to verify this theoretically and further understand the mechanisms of such convergence.  Finally, the project will develop the theory of isoperimetric inequalities for eigenvalues of Dirac operator following the framework of Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues.

The aim of differential geometry is to study higher-dimensional shapes and their curvature. In particular, these concepts provide a mathematical framework for general relativity.  Geometric flows are a key tool in differential geometry.  The idea here is to take a geometric object and evolve it by a differential equation in order to smooth it out. These differential equations share common features with heat diffusion. However, the differential equations that arise in geometry tend to be nonlinear, which presents challenges in their analysis.  A main focus is to understand the behavior of these equations when the solution becomes singular, that is, when the curvature becomes very large.  An important problem is to classify the singularity models; these are the limiting shapes that occur at a singularity. Another major goal in geometry is to understand geometric inequalities.  A basic example is the isoperimetric inequality (which states that balls have smallest surface area among all shapes that enclose a given amount of volume), but many other types of inequalities are of importance in differential geometry.  The project also includes training of PhD students and mentoring of post-doctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The primary examples of geometric flows are the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The mean curvature flow is the most natural evolution equation for a surface embedded in Euclidean space, while the Ricci flow is the most natural evolution equation for a Riemannian metric.  The Ricci flow has become an indispensable tool in differential geometry. Among other things, the Ricci flow lies at the heart of Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture. The PI will study what types of singularities can form under these evolution equations.  For example, it would be very interesting to understand whether a plane of multiplicity 2 can arise as a singularity model under the mean curvature flow.  In another direction, the PI will study problems related to geometric inequalities.

Einstein?s theory of general relativity describes how spacetime is curved by gravitation. The language of his theory is geometry and the phenomenon is governed by his eponymous equation. Recent advances such as the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and the observation of black hole images by the Event Horizon Telescope confirmed predictions made by Einstein?s theory, and enhanced our understanding of the global and large scale structure of astrophysical events and objects. The PI's research will apply the latest mathematical breakthroughs in spacetime geometry and Einstein?s equation to obtain the most precise descriptions and measurements of fundamental concepts such as energy and angular momentum on any finitely extended region of the universe. This is essential in understanding the local and fine structure of our universe, with applications in, for example, GPS technology and space exploration, as well as the interaction of gravitating systems such as black hole coalescence. A novel application of the concepts is to space-times beyond four dimensions, which arise in the most viable approach in unifying general relativity and quantum physics. The PI will also study geometric objects of manifold dimensions that live in ambient spaces of even greater dimensions. Examples of such include gigantic data sets that rely on multiple variables subject to multiple constraints. The PI will apply the method of differential equations to investigate the optimal shapes/phases of these objects. The research in the project will be used to promote interest in mathematics among undergraduate students and to provide motivations for research projects. The PI has been engaging himself in educating a diversified body of undergraduate/graduate students and young researchers, and the project will be instrumental for his continued efforts along this direction. In addition, several research problems studied in this proposal are of interest beyond mathematics and there is considerable potential for interdisciplinary cooperations. <br/><br/><br/>The PI plans to resolve several outstanding problems related to higher dimensional gravity and submanifolds of higher codimensions by the method of geometric analysis.

Riemannian manifolds appear everywhere in physics, modeling the membrane of a cell as well as spacetime in general relativity, and Riemannian geometry offers fundamental tools to study their properties.  One concept of paramount importance, when studying physical objects as well as Riemannian manifolds in general, is that of symmetry, that is, the degree of ""self similarity"" of a geometric object, which make it invariant under certain length-preserving transformations (called isometries). Symmetry can be further generalized with the idea of partitioning a geometric object into ""sheets"", which stay parallel to one another. This idea, formalized by the mathematical concept of singular Riemannian foliation, is at the center of the mathematical investigation of this project.  Here, we use ideas introduced by the PI and collaborators to study the local behavior of these structures, as well as use them globally to produce new  manifolds with desirable curvature.  In this project, geometry is also used as a broad concept to encompass a number of activities for the mathematical community and society in general, such as:  1) Organizing a four-weeks-long thematic program in Metric Geometry, with schools for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a week-long conference.  2) Organizing a weekly math camp for girls in 3rd grade and up which is aimed at addressing the gender imbalance in the mathematical disciplines.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to study singular Riemannian foliations, both to further understand their structure and to apply them to Invariant Theory and Riemannian Geometry.  The local study of singular Riemannian foliations, namely foliations on a Euclidean space with the origin as one leaf, generalizes orthogonal representations of Lie groups. The PI proved in a recent joint work that infinitesimal submetries have an algebraic counterpart, given by certain polynomial algebras called Laplacian algebras. This opens the door to a novel approach called ""Invariant theory without groups"", consisting in understanding how to read geometric properties of manifold submetries off of their Laplacian algebra, and apply these techniques to the special case in which the submetry comes from an orthogonal representation.  Globally, singular Riemannian foliations can conjecturally arise from collapsing sequences of manifolds with a uniform lower sectional curvature bound: One project will try to prove this locally. Furthermore, singular Riemannian foliations will be used to produce new examples of manifolds with non-negative and positive curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A ""metric"" on such a space is an object that endows that space with a shape or more precisely, with Ricci curvature. The study of these metrics lies at the nexus of complex geometry and geometric analysis. This project is concerned with the construction of complete Kahler metrics with prescribed Ricci curvature on non-compact Kahler manifolds; more specifically, non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and Kahler-Ricci solitons. Applications of such manifolds permeate throughout physics and mathematics. Indeed, Calabi-Yau manifolds of complex dimension three have become prominent in string theory where they supposedly model the six additional real dimensions of space-time that we do not see, whereas Kahler-Ricci solitons provide models for the formation of singularities in an important evolution equation, namely the Kahler-Ricci flow. Efforts will be made to construct new examples of these manifolds and to formulate their existence in terms of algebraic geometric criteria. This will enhance our understanding of the geometry of non-compact Kahler manifolds and will involve applications of techniques from analysis, in particular partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the proposed research project comprises two parts. The goal of the first part is to construct more examples of non-compact complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with Euclidean volume growth and with a singular non-flat tangent cone at infinity, developing the work of Li, the PI and Rochon, and Szekelyhidi. Such manifolds have been used as building blocks for G2-manifolds and may shed light on a conjecture of Yau asserting the compactifiability of a complete Calabi-Yau manifold with finite topology. Moreover, these manifolds have applications in physics such as in the AdS/CFT correspondence and string theory. The second part of the proposal deals with studying complete non-compact gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons. The objectives of this part are threefold.<br/>(1) To glue the expanding gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons that the PI has constructed with Deruelle together on a compact Kahler manifold to construct a solution of the Kahler-Ricci flow with singular initial data.

Similarly, the world we are living in can be modeled as a four-dimensional manifold with three spatial and one time directions.

The main tools come from algebraic topology, a general framework that allows one to reformulate questions about topology and geometry in terms of equivalent questions about algebraic structures such as vector spaces. Topological spaces will be encoded in terms of algebraic structures with particular operations. The PI will also use a similar algebraic framework to study string topology, a theory concerned with interactions of strings and loops in a geometric space. The study of topological and geometric spaces by means of algebraic structures is of fundamental importance in mathematics as well as in mathematical physics. The project aims to explain mathematically the sense in which the fields of topology, geometry, and algebra are equivalent, and the sense in which they are different. The computational tools and invariants that arise from studying the interplay between these fields are useful in the mathematical formulation of quantum field theory, string theory, and mirror symmetry in physics.

This viewpoint is motivated by a new observation of the PI and M. Zeinalian: the E-infinity coalgebra structure of the singular chains on a space determines the fundamental group in complete generality and this data is preserved under maps which become quasi-isomorphisms after applying the cobar functor. Once homotopy types are understood through this framework, the resulting algebraic structure will be enhanced with extra operations describing Poincaré duality at the chain level in order to characterize topological manifold structures in a homotopy type. The second part of the project is concerned with both foundational and computational questions regarding the string topology of manifolds. Some of the algebraic structures that arise in string topology, in particular the operations related to the Goresky-Hingston coproduct, are able to detect fine geometric information that go beyond the homotopy type in the non-simply connected context. String topology operations will be analyzed using the framework of Hochschild homology and Tate cohomology, as developed in previous work of the PI and Z. Wang.

The importance of gauge fields in pure mathematics stems from their relationship to the geometry of shapes known as manifolds. This leads to the second objective of this project, which is to apply the theory of generalized Seiberg-Witten equations to find new ways of distinguishing different manifolds from one another. The Principal Investigator (PI) is specifically interested in applications lying at the intersection of different areas of research, such as algebraic geometry (which studies manifolds described by equations), symplectic geometry (which studies manifolds related to classical mechanics), topology (which studies properties of manifolds which remain unchanged under deformations), and string theory (a branch of modern theoretical physics). In addition, the project's goal is to expose a broad audience, including graduate and undergraduate students, as well as researchers in other areas, to some of the ideas and techniques of gauge theory and geometry.

Mathematical relationships known as isoperimetric inequalities govern fundamental principles in geometry and analysis; they determine the formation of structures, like soap bubbles, honeycombs, and crystals, among many others. Recently, fundamental isoperimetric inequalities, especially for convex shapes, have admitted stronger probabilistic versions that apply to an object's typical random substructures. This probabilistic shift coincides with a demand for new tools to quantify regularity in high-dimensional random objects.  This, in turn, is reshaping connections between isoperimetric inequalities and motivating new principles that can be applied outside of convex geometric analysis. This research aims to re-examine fundamental relationships between convexity and isoperimetry from a stochastic, that is random, viewpoint. Developments in Euclidean space provide a foundation to see how far such principles extend - from sets to functions, beyond Euclidean spaces, and to more abstract mathematical entities, such as functionals of matrices and related more general notions of convexity. Progress in these directions will have direct applications in high-dimensional probability, including problems on the behavior of products of large random matrices. The project includes topics tailored to undergraduate, graduate, as well as postdoctoral research. The Principal Investigator will continue to mentor these early career researchers. He will also develop a special graduate course and an expository monograph on stochastic isoperimetry and its applications. The results of the research will be disseminated through talks given at national and international research meetings.<br/><br/>Convexity and randomness provide a natural bridge between geometric notions and probabilistic behavior, for example, diameters of random sets translate naturally to largest singular values of random matrices. In this way, stochastic isoperimetric principles become distributional inequalities for high-dimensional random objects. The Principal Investigator will develop a comprehensive theory of stochastic isoperimetric inequalities for random functions, especially related to centroid bodies and duality. In large part, stochastic isoperimetry has relied on Euclidean symmetrization methods in product spaces.  Other forms of symmetrization also lend themselves to the stochastic approach.  Even for the sphere, core isoperimetric principles remain at the stage of conjectures. Starting with a stochastic point of view will provide a basis to develop geometric, analytic and probabilistic aspects simultaneously. Moreover, important functionals of random matrices follow the same set of principles. This motivates isoperimetry for geometric functionals of random matrices, especially non-spectral quantities and operators acting in spaces equipped with non-Euclidean norms. The appeal of new links between geometric analysis, probability and random matrix theory is a major driving force behind this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motions of particles in our universe can be cyclical, but we do not always know how many such periodic trajectories these particles can have. The goal of this project is to use both gauge theory and symplectic geometry in tandem to detect the possible smooth shapes of our universe and to probe the evolution of systems that can arise in said universe, and to develop these mathematical tools further in order to be more efficient in our calculations.

Complex manifolds are higher-dimensional surfaces that are defined using the complex numbers. Recently, there has been significant progress in the study of ""metrics"" on complex manifolds, objects that endow these spaces with a shape or more precisely, curvature. The study of these metrics lies at the nexus of complex geometry and geometric analysis. The aim of this conference is to gather together experts working in these two fields to discuss these new and exciting developments. Even though lately there have been many conferences in complex geometry, none have really been organised to address these recent discoveries. This conference serves to fulfill this necessity. In doing so, it will promote collaboration across many areas of the aforementioned fields of complex geometry and geometric analysis. The latest breakthroughs in these two fields will be presented to a new generation of mathematicians, with a particular emphasis on women and those from minority groups. The conference will provide a forum for senior mathematicians to interact with graduate students through the organisation of an optional poster presentation for graduate students which will take place in a non-intimidating and relaxed environment. Ample opportunity will also be provided to women speakers to present their research, with at least one talk per day scheduled for a female speaker. Moreover, the conference will provide a platform for postdocs and junior researchers to present their work. Participants will be brought up-to-date with all of the current developments in the field and will be presented with new avenues of research in the enticing environment that Miami provides in the Winter.<br/> <br/>More specifically, the Conference on Special Metrics in Complex Geometry will concentrate on the interplay between complex geometry and geometric analysis, with an emphasis being given to equations arising in the construction of hermitian and Kahler metrics with prescribed curvature properties, for example, the complex Monge-Ampere equation in Kahler geometry. These equations are among the most important appearing in geometric analysis and understanding their structure and the techniques involved in their solution are paramount for further progress in the field. Recent breakthroughs include, among others, the independent construction of non-flat Ricci-flat Kahler metrics with maximal volume growth on complex affine space of dimensions three and greater by Li, Conlon-Rochon, and Szekelyhidi, the construction of new examples of gradient expanding and steady Kahler-Ricci solitons by Conlon-Deruelle and Biquard-Macbeth respectively, the solution by Chen-Cheng of a major conjecture of Tian stating the equivalence between the existence of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics on a compact Kahler manifold and the properness of Mabuchi's K-energy, and the recent families of Ricci-flat Kahler metrics exhibited by Hein-Sun-Viaclovsky-Zhang on K3 surfaces which collapse to an interval with Tian-Yau and Taub-NUT metrics occurring as bubbles. These topics will all form part of the conversation at the conference in January 2021.

Its central objects are the gauge fields appearing in the theory of nuclear forces discovered by C.-N. Yang and R. Mills in 1954, which were already familiar to mathematicians. The Yang-Mills field equations have subsequently had an enormous influence in geometry, notably through Donaldson's work on four-dimensional exotic smooth structures. Yang-Mills flow is a natural evolution process designed to solve the Yang-Mills equations, much as Hamilton's Ricci flow does for the Einstein equations. The goal of this research is to pursue novel applications to mathematical gauge theory by refining and extending the PI's results on the analytic behavior of Yang-Mills flow. <br/><br/>In dimension four, it remains to establish the uniqueness of the infinite-time Uhlenbeck limit together with the position of the bubbling points, which requires carrying out the well-known convergence technique due to Leon Simon in the presence of singularities. There are two main directions for applying the flow within 4-dimensional gauge theory: the first is to non-minimal solutions of the Yang-Mills equations on the 4-sphere, where the analogue of the Willmore conjecture (proved by Marques and Neves in 2012) is still unknown. The second is to the Atiyah-Jones conjecture on the stable topology of instanton moduli spaces on the 4-sphere or a K3 surface. The simpler case of the Yang-Mills functional over 3-manifolds is also largely unexplored. Lastly, the PI intends to develop Yang-Mills flow as a tool within the Donaldson-Thomas program for gauge theory on higher-dimensional manifolds with special holonomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems are fundamental across the sciences, but the mathematics underlying their study is very difficult, many important questions remain open, and new ideas are needed.  A main theme of this project is to use a geometric approach to bring fresh insight to this field.  Recently, the PI and collaborators used techniques from symplectic geometry to settle a longstanding question about certain dynamical systems. They showed that a particular dynamical system would take an infinite amount of energy to produce and used this to establish a new dichotomy in the set of systems: the finite-energy ones, and the rest.  This dichotomy will enable a deeper understanding of the classification of dynamical systems and should allow for the resolution of several questions that have attracted wide interest.  This project involves further research in this direction.  One goal of the project is to find a further dichotomy for the finite-energy systems.  By bringing a geometric approach to bear on questions about dynamical systems that have resisted solution by other methods, the project aims to showcase the power of these kinds of techniques.  At the same time, an idea at the heart of the approach comes from studying when one symplectic shape can be deformed into a subset of another, and research in these directions should deepen our understanding of symplectic geometry.  The project also has a substantial education component.  The PI has previously worked to broaden participation in mathematics, foster equity, and support educational efforts in the field through prison education, research training in geometry at the high school and undergraduate levels, and course design.  The project supports this work and related activities.     <br/><br/>This project involves a series of research investigations touching on the related fields of symplectic dynamics, symplectic embeddings, and continuous symplectic geometry.  The main emphasis is on questions in low dimensions where powerful gauge theoretic techniques are available. The PI and collaborators recently settled the longstanding ""Simplicity Conjecture"" partly by contributing to the theory of periodic Floer homology spectral invariants. The project aims to further develop this theory and solve several longstanding questions; for example, to prove an analogue of the Simplicity Conjecture in higher genus.  The project also aims to clarify the dynamics of Reeb flows, study infinite staircases in symplectic embedding problems, investigate questions about topological symplectic manifolds, and study higher-dimensional symplectic packing problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand properties of the physical world such as angles and distances. Differential geometry in turn was developed to use the tools of calculus to understand curved spaces. For example, differential geometry can be used to understand the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity. In the same way that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis. The project will investigate problems from geometry and mathematical physics that are united by the role played by mathematical analysis. In addition to mathematical investigations, the PI will continue to organize a summer residential STEM program in cooperation with the Chicago Pre-College Science and Engineering Program.  This is a program for high school students from the Chicago Public Schools, many of whom will be first-generation college students.  The program will run for two weeks, and will include mathematics instruction and project-based learning <br/><br/>There are two main mathematical themes in this project. Poincaré-Einstein manifolds are generalizations of the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space.  They are complete manifolds satisfying the Einstein condition (with negative Einstein constant) which can be compactified by conformally changing the metric that vanishes at an appropriate rate at infinity. They arise in several areas of mathematics and theoretical physics; for example, in in the Fefferman-Graham theory of conformal invariants and in the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. One area of investigation in this project is the fundamental question of existence: given a manifold with boundary and a conformal class of metrics on the boundary, can one construct a Poincaré-Einstein metric whose compactification induces the given conformal class on the boundary?  In joint work with S.Y.A Chang, PI will be studying the problem of using the geometry of the conformal boundary to solve a nonlinear PDE in the interior, and showing how the existence of solutions allows us to use Morse Theory to identify topological obstructions to existence. Another area of research with connections to physics is the PI?s ongoing work with S. Perez-Ayala on extremizing eigenvalues of conformally covariant operators. In the case of surfaces, extremal eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator have connections to minimal surfaces and harmonic maps.  In recent work with Perez-Ayala PI showed that under certain natural conditions, one can extremize the low eigenvalues of the conformal Laplacian in higher dimensions, and there are examples of extremals that give rise to harmonic maps. In ongoing work PI will study other operators and try to understand a kind of reverse construction; i.e., when a harmonic map gives rise to a maximal metric.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the study of these objects, a fundamental role is played by the mapping class group, which captures the symmetries of a space and encodes gluing data for building new spaces, such as fiber bundles. The study of mapping class groups is a meeting ground for many areas including geometric group theory, dynamics, homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. This project focuses on using mapping class groups to understand geometric properties of fiber bundles. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and includes organizing the Brown-Yale Geometry and Topology Conference. <br/><br/>The project has three main objectives. (1) Find new examples of non-flat bundles, especially surface bundles whose base is low-dimensional. Research in this direction will increase our understanding of the dynamics of surface homeomorphisms, the algebra of mapping class groups, and their relation. (2) Establish new connections between the dynamical properties of a pseudo-Anosov surface homeomorphism and the (non)arithmeticity of the associated hyperbolic mapping torus, thereby building on work of Thurston and Bowditch-Maclachlan-Reid. (3) Provide new examples of convex-cocompact subgroups of the mapping class group. This work is aimed at a conjecture of Farb-Mosher regarding purely pseudo-Anosov subgroups of mapping class groups, and it also has connections to 3-manifold topology.

The Institute will be held July 19-August 28, 2021 online; more information can be found on its website (http://geometry.institute).  Overall, SGI aims to accomplish the following objectives: (1) spark wide collaboration among students and researchers in geometry processing, (2) launch inter-university research projects in geometry processing involving team members across broad levels of seniority (undergraduate, graduate, faculty, industrial researcher), (3) introduce students to geometry processing research and development, and (4) diversify the ""pipeline"" of students entering geometry processing research, in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic background, and home institution. The first week of the Institute will train undergraduate and MS student participants on state-of-the-art techniques in geometry processing, intended as their first exposure to this discipline.  Then, for the remaining weeks, student teams collaborate on research problems, with the goal of exploring directions suggested by senior attendees.  Beyond these day-long interactions, visitors will give talks on frontier areas and lead relevant tutorials.  The opportunity cost for students taking six weeks to participate will be covered by the workshop.  <br/><br/>As a discipline, geometry processing presents substantial theoretical challenges motivated by practical considerations of manufacturing/fabrication, computer vision, physical simulation, and high-performance computing.  Participants will be exposed to---and will advance state-of-the-art in---technical problems ranging from the development of a toolkit for discrete differential geometry to the incorporation of probability/uncertainty in the shape processing pipeline.  Participating in geometry processing research also gives mathematics students exposure to fields like differential geometry in a more tangible environment, coupled with computer visualizations and concrete applications with immediate impact.  Our workshop is designed to make progress on several concrete challenges in geometry processing, including development of robust geometry processing algorithms, design of high-throughput shape analysis methods, design of sensible machine learning architectures for understanding and processing geometry built on foundations from differential/algebraic geometry, and extending machinery from geometry processing to higher-dimensional problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
