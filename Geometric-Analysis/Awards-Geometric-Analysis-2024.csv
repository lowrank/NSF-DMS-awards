In more recent decades, potential theory has been recognized as ubiquitous in many different areas of mathematics and physics. This project seeks to understand the role of potential theory in complex geometry. Broadly speaking, complex geometry aims to find ideal geometric models that are simple enough to model the physical universe, describing interactions between small particles, or even colliding galaxies. The PI will also train graduate students in the subject area, and introduce undergraduates to this field through summer research programs, in each case focusing on providing opportunities to traditionally underrepresented members of academia. On the outreach side, the PI will continue to make educational videos disseminated online, as well as give popular science lectures in local middle schools.<br/><br/>Complex geometry is the discipline at the intersection of differential and algebraic geometry. As advocated by Demailly, Siu, and others, it is possible to study this subject using potential-theoretic methods. Along these lines, the PI plans to make significant progress on a cluster of interconnected questions and conjectures in complex geometry by employing a combination of methods from potential theory, infinite-dimensional geometry, and more traditional methods of geometric analysis. There is a vast literature on Kähler quantization for smooth metrics. Instead, the PI will study quantization in the context of finite energy potential theory that accommodates degenerate Kähler metrics. Potential applications range from the quantization of Radon measures to Yau-Tian-Donaldson type theorems. The PI will also study the fascinating connections between convex and complex geometry in the transcendental context. This includes establishing a link between the Hausdorff geometry of convex bodies and the geometry of singularity types of quasiplurisubharmonic functions, and better understanding the complex Brunn-Minkowski inequality of Berndtsson, leading to uniqueness theorems for degenerate canonical Kähler metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A state of the system corresponds to a point in an even dimensional phase space, and the system evolves along an odd dimensional energy level in the phase space. A particular focus will be placed on understanding the existence and properties of periodic orbits, which describe behavior that repeats in time, especially in the case when the phase space is four dimensional and the energy level is three dimensional. The geometry of the phase space will also be studied, developing methods to determine when one dynamical system is equivalent to another one by a change of coordinates. Various research projects on these topics will provide research training for graduate students in the latest techniques in symplectic geometry and related areas of mathematics. The PI will also engage in multiple outreach activities. <br/><br/>Specific projects include the following. Filtrations on embedded contact homology will be studied with the goal of proving in full generality that every contact form on a closed three-manifold has either two or infinitely many simple Reeb orbits. Knot filtered embedded contact homology will be studied with applications to symplectic cobordisms between transverse knots. Symplectic invariants of open domains arising from barcodes in equivariant symplectic homology will be used to classify some open domains up to symplectomorphism. Closing lemmas will be extended to more general vector fields than Reeb vector fields in three dimensions. Universal quantitative invariants will be developed with applications to symplectic embedding problems, constraints on Lagrangian submanifolds, refinements of the Arnold chord conjecture, elementary spectral invariants of contact manifolds, and comparisons between symplectic capacities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One approach to studying these spaces is to endow them with geometric structure and then use the geometry to study the spaces. The three most familiar geometries are the classical Euclidean or flat geometry, and the two non-Euclidean geometries: spherical and hyperbolic. It has been known since the late 1800s that most two-dimensional spaces (or surfaces) exhibit hyperbolic geometry. Thurston's groundbreaking work in the 1970s showed that ""most"" three dimensional spaces (or three-manifolds) also have hyperbolic geometry. The rich landscape of hyperbolic manifolds in two and three dimensions motivates this project's focus on hyperbolic geometry. The project will include many sub-projects suitable for training graduate students to work in this area.<br/> <br/>The PI, together with graduate students, will study questions around the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One central topic will be the ""renormalized volume"" of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, and the connection between the Weil-Petersson gradient flow and the volume of the convex core.  While renormalized volume has strong connections to physics, in this project the focus will be mathematical. The PI will study a version of renormalized volume of the universal Teichmüller space,  and Thurston's skinning map.  In another series of projects, the PI will study a family of curve complexes that interpolates between the usual curve graph and a quasi-tree, and will investigate the existence of actions of the mapping class group on median spaces and CAT(0) cube complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This involves studying minima of certain functionals, called Lagrangians, named after the French mathematician and astronomer J-L Lagrange (1736-1813), that describe the energy of the system under consideration. For example, it is possible to derive Newton's laws of classical mechanics from the principle of least action. The principle can be applied also to more complicated systems, even infinite dimensional configuration spaces. One famous such example is the case of geodesics, paths minimizing the distance between two points in a smooth space. Another, more involved example is the case of harmonic maps. Here the Lagrangian energy is the total stretch of a map between two smooth spaces. In this project the PI proposes to study analogous situations for more complicated Lagrangians that have important applications. The project has also an educational component where the PI is planning to supervise graduate students towards their Ph.D. theses, undergraduates through seminar courses, and write expository notes for a wider audience.<br/> <br/>In slightly more technical terms, harmonic maps are critical points of the L-2  norm of the gradient (Dirichlet integral)  of a map between two Riemannian manifolds. The PI proposes to study the calculus of variations of functionals associated with other function space norms like the L-infinity and L-1 norms. Minimizing functionals associated to the L-infinity norm yield solutions of fully non-linear degenerate elliptic PDE?s with very challenging regularity properties. Similarly, solutions of the dual non-linear problem for functionals involving the L-1 norm are equally challenging. The singular sets of these solutions provide geometric realizations of topological objects, like geodesic foliations and laminations, studied in topology. The PI proposes to develop the analytic methods to study these topological objects as well as others studied in Thurston theory. Examples  are earthquakes and cataclysms. There is very little known in the literature about the analytic underpinnings of the theory so the PI has to develop most of the techniques from scratch.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical analogues of eigenfunctions are standing waves, and the eigenvalues may be thought of as their corresponding frequencies. The interdependence between high-frequency eigenfunctions and the geometry of the manifold on which they live is central to a broad range of fields from quantum physics to number theory. Indeed, eigenfunctions are steady-state solutions to the Schrödinger equation, and their eigenvalues are the corresponding energies. To illustrate the connection to number theory, the task of accurately counting the number of eigenfunctions of a given frequency on the flat torus is equivalent to counting the number of ways an integer can be expressed as the sum of, say, two squares. This project aims to develop new tools to advance understanding in spectral asymptotics, whose interconnectedness to seemingly disparate areas of mathematics and science make its study particularly valuable. <br/><br/>As part of the research project, the PI intends to develop and use tools from microlocal analysis and the theory of Fourier integral operators to refine a variety of formulas describing the behavior of high-frequency eigenfunctions, and in particular describing what effect the underlying geometry has on these formulas. The PI intends to make advancements towards a conjecture on the remainder term of the Weyl law for products of manifolds, to develop a general multilinear theory of Fourier integral operators for use in both spectral asymptotics and geometric measure theory, and to further explore the connection between spectral quantities and the presence of corresponding geometric configurations in the manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two-dimensional surfaces are topologically characterized by the number of holes within, a simple notion of complexity. Optimizing geometry helps to better understand the underlying topology; for example, flattening a crumpled sheet of paper or untying a balloon animal makes it easier to count their holes. Ricci flow, a geometric optimization technique, searches for optimal geometries called Einstein manifolds, generalizing flat planes and round spheres. This flow provides an algorithmic approach to decomposing three-dimensional geometries and has been used to characterize topologies in dimension three. While challenges in dimension five have been addressed through systematic methods, the final frontier is dimension four, where Einstein manifolds have been extensively studied in physics. This project aims to further study Einstein four-manifolds while developing a new, four-dimensional-specific theory of Ricci flow. It will bring together researchers from analysis, geometry, topology, and physics. The PI will involve undergraduate and graduate students in the project and integrate research questions into teaching and advising. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand and construct 4-dimensional Einstein metrics and Ricci flows. The main difficulties are singularities, where topological surgeries occur, specifically ""orbifold"" singularities, ""cusp"" formation, and collapsing. The PI will continue studying these degenerations, their stability, and their links to additional structures such as a Kähler one. Most results about Ricci flows are either 3-dimensional or apply to any n-dimension, with few focusing on the specifics of dimension 4, where most topological questions remain open. Through his extensive study of Einstein 4-manifolds, the PI is familiar with the rich set of 4-dimensional techniques developed over decades.

Such surfaces locally minimize area and appear everywhere in nature? in chemistry, materials science, biology, and general relativity.   In mathematics, they have been applied more recently to solve problems in Geometry and Topology, such as the Poincaré Conjecture, the Willmore conjecture, and more recently to prove the Smale Conjecture in many spherical space-forms.  The PI will work to discover new minimal surfaces which are not area-minimizing (and thus very difficult to find in nature) - but which can have other major applications in Geometry.

The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles (the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is less appealing that the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which minimizes the total energy. This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. The projects supported by this award are to define appropriate energies on such spaces, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy. The PI is committed to integrating research and education and cultivating intellectual development on many levels, and plans to continue to be active in outreach and organization of conferences and other events in the mathematics community.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the research of the PI is, broadly speaking, to use solutions of partial differential equations which are geometric in origin to study properties of differentiable manifolds. The main areas of concentration of the PI's research are the classification of gravitational instantons in dimension four, understanding Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Einstein metrics in the collapsing case, and the study of higher-dimensional complete non-compact Calabi-Yau structures. The PI has contributed to the classification of gravitational instantons in dimension 4, and plans to further investigate the global structure of the moduli spaces of these metrics. The PI has also contributed to the classification of asymptotically Calabi Calabi-Yau structures, and plans to study other types of complete non-compact Calabi-Yau structures in higher dimensions.

Of significant interest in this research are the mean curvature flow and the Ricci flow, which are often likened to the diffusion of heat and the heat equation. These flows leverage the concept of diffusion to canonically deform geometric objects towards equilibrium states, which are significantly easier to characterize or analyze. Geometric flows have thus demonstrated valuable geometric applications, particularly in  classification theorems and geometric inequalities. Notable examples include the utilization of  Ricci flow to the resolution of the long-standing Poincare conjecture, and the application of inverse mean curvature flow in establishing the Riemannian Penrose inequality, a crucial statement in general relativity. Beyond geometry, geometric flows find extensive use in various physical problems. For instance, mean curvature flow plays a role in describing interface evolution in multiphase physical models. Likewise, it is employed in material science to model the growth of cells, grains, and bubbles. Additionally, a discrete version of Ricci flow is applied in data science, such as in community detection. The study of geometric flows and their diverse applications represents a vibrant and influential area of mathematics. This project aims to enhance the field's impact by involving graduate students in different facets of research and fostering collaborations among researchers across diverse disciplines and institutions.<br/><br/>The forthcoming research will concentrate on ancient solutions to the mean curvature and Ricci flows. Ancient solutions refer to solutions that have existed for all times in the past. They are of particular interest due to their significance in studying singularities, which present challenges to the geometric applications of these flows. Understanding the geometry and behavior of ancient solutions is therefore crucial. Despite significant advances in this area in recent decades, there remain large classes of such solutions about which little is known. The proposed project seeks to offer classification results for ancient solutions of mean curvature, mean curvature type, and Ricci flow, without making noncollapsing or compactness assumptions. Our strategy involves developing a method to construct new collapsed ancient solutions and classify them based on specific symmetry assumptions. Drawing on our established methods for constructing and characterizing ancient convex solutions to mean curvature flow, which have proven successful and adaptable, we aim to explore the potential existence of a dichotomy theorem for Ricci flow akin to the one for mean curvature flow, by introducing a width concept for Ricci flow. Finally, by refining and enhancing these techniques, we aim to furnish a more comprehensive classification result for convex collapsed solutions of mean curvature flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The differential equations under consideration have geometric motivation and content, and model natural problems such as the reconstruction of the shape of a geometric object based on knowledge of how that object curves in its ambient environment, or the motion of a geometric object which deforms in a manner determined by its extrinsic curvature. Other equations of interest describe the structure of geometric objects which locally minimize a suitable notion of area subject to predetermined constraints. Such objects arise classically in mathematical models for soap films. Prescribed curvature equations and the equations describing time-dependent curvature flow also find applications in mathematical physics, e.g., to the geometry of spacetime and to the deformation theory of elastic bodies. The project will generate research opportunities for graduate students and will facilitate the mentoring of graduate students and postdocs through interactive research seminars. In addition, the principal investigator will prepare publicly accessible educational materials through the writing of survey articles on the subject.<br/><br/>Two important types of nonlinear geometric partial differential equations feature heavily in this project: Lagrangian mean curvature equations (and the associated flows), and the Hamiltonian stationary equation (along with other fourth order equations of a similar type). Lagrangian mean curvature equations feature in the existence theory for special Lagrangian submanifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds, a central issue in mirror symmetry. The Hamiltonian stationary equation identifies critical points for the volume functional on Lagrangian submanifolds under Hamiltonian variations. A priori estimates are crucial for solving certain fully nonlinear equations and for determining fundamental properties of their solutions. Building on prior work in the complex Euclidean setting, the PI will investigate regularity and well-posedness of the variable Lagrangian phase function. In the Lagrangian context, variational problems for the volume functional lead to nonlinear equations of fourth order. A relevant challenge is to identify submanifolds that are minimal within a specific Hamiltonian isotopy class.

Specific questions to be investigated concern the inverse spectral problem, the structure of Laplacian eigenfunctions, and the asymptotic behavior of Bergman kernels. These topics are crucial for understanding how geometric structure influences spectral properties, and are deeply connected to various concepts in mathematics and mathematical physics. The inverse spectral problem investigates how much information about the shape of a (not necessarily round) drum can be obtained solely from its frequencies of vibration. This is a classical question famously popularized by Mark Kac with the phrase `Can one hear the shape of a drum?? A second set of problems focuses on the shape and the size of the set (`nodal set?) on which an eigenstate of the Laplacian operator vanishes. The size (in the sense of Hausdorff measure) of the nodal set is conjectured to be comparable to the frequency of the eigenstate. Finally, the Bergman kernel is an essential concept in the fields of complex analysis and complex geometry. Bergman kernel approximations arise naturally in mathematical physics, especially in string theory, where they have been proposed as a tool for the search for geometrically well-behaved complex metric structures. The broader impacts of the project contribute to education and diversity. The principal investigator actively supervises graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Additionally, the PI participates in outreach activities such as organizing math competitions for middle school students and mentoring students from diverse backgrounds through summer research programs.<br/><br/>The planned research lies in three main areas. Building on previous work with Steve Zelditch, in which nearly circular ellipses were shown to be spectrally unique among smooth domains, the PI aims to generalize such results to generic ellipses and to domains with constant width. Another direction of interest resides in strong inverse spectral results for generic polygons. Next, recent work by the PI resulted in new explicit upper bounds for the Hausdorff measure of nodal sets of eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds with Gevrey or quasianalytic regularity. The PI seeks to extend these results to manifolds with boundaries and to improve the current upper bounds using innovative methods. Finally, in collaboration with Hang Xu, the PI investigates asymptotic properties of Bergman kernels. This includes establishing new off-diagonal asymptotics for smooth Kaehler potentials and improving extant upper bounds for Bergman kernels. In addition, the PI will explore convergence properties of the Fefferman expansion for domains with real analytic boundaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elliptic differential equations are also used to quantify the degree to which physical objects are bent or distorted, with far-reaching implications and applications in geometry and topology. The proposed research focuses on the regularity of solutions to such equations. Questions to be addressed include the following: Do non-smooth points (singularities) exist? How large can the set of singularities be? What is the behavior of the solution near a singularity? Is it possible to perturb the underlying environment in order to eliminate the singularity? The project will also provide opportunities for the professional development of graduate students, both via individual mentoring and via the organization of a directed learning seminar on geometric analysis and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical objectives of the project are twofold. First, the principal investigator will study unique continuation for solutions to elliptic partial differential equations, with a focus on quantitative estimates on the size and structure of the singular set of these solutions. A second topic for consideration is the regularity theory for generalized minimal submanifolds (a generalized notion of smooth submanifolds which arise as critical points for the area functional under local deformations). In particular, the principal investigator will study branch singular points in the interior as well as at the boundary of a generalized minimal submanifold, under an area-minimizing or stability assumption.

General relativity is a geometric theory of gravity proposed by A. Einstein over a century ago. It is fundamental to our understanding of the large scale structure of the universe, and has many practical applications such as to the fine tuning of global positioning system (GPS) technology. Within this theory, singularities are known to generically form in the evolution of spacetime. A central conjecture due to R. Penrose, which is tied to the predictive power of general relativity, asserts that these singularities must be hidden behind the horizons of black holes. One of the main objectives of this project is to investigate this conjecture, known as weak cosmic censorship, by establishing a range of geometric inequalities relating total mass of a spacetime to properties of the black holes it contains. This project will also involve a significant impact in the educational arena at all levels, through the training of at least five Ph.D. students under the PI's supervision to the development of STEM talent in high schools by mentoring local students' research projects and science competition entries.<br/><br/><br/>The PI will develop ideas surrounding a new proof of the positive mass theorem based on level sets of spacetime harmonic functions. This new quantitative approach suggests methods to complete the stability program, and establish more general mass lower bounds. With collaborators, the PI will continue investigations of the harmonic maps with prescribed singularities which naturally arise from the stationary Einstein equations under symmetry conditions, and use this theory to find new black hole solutions with exotic topologies. This work also suggests a novel method to construct Riemannian Einstein metrics, as well as a possible classification for stationary axisymmetric black holes. Recently, together with Alaee and Yau the PI has introduced a new quasi-local mass with advantageous attributes, and will fully explore its properties with the goal of applying it to the trapped surface/hoop conjecture associated with gravitational collapse, as well as the proposed Bekenstein bounds concerning the entropy/information within a relativistic body which has implications from thermodynamics to computer science.

Hamiltonian mechanics, which provides an alternative formulation to Newtonian mechanics and is particularly useful in classical and quantum mechanics, expresses the time evolution of a system in terms of partial derivatives of a certain energy. The resulting equations, called Hamilton?s equations, describe how the coordinates and momenta of a system evolve over time.

At the core of the theory is the classical inequality, which asserts that the circle has the smallest perimeter among all shapes of fixed area.

An empirical form of the classical inequality states that uniformly sampling points from a domain results in the expected perimeter of the convex hull being greater than if the same number of random points were sampled uniformly within a disk of equal area. This innovative approach opens new avenues for applying isoperimetric inequalities to random structures.  The proposal's interplay between geometry and probability leads to applications to various problems in learning theory and algorithmic complexity.

The mathematics behind origami, however, is not yet fully understood. In particular, some origami models can be folded and unfolded in such a way that we could make the crease lines be hinges and the paper between them stiff like sheet metal. Such models are called rigidly flexible origami and have applications that span the physical and biological sciences, ranging from unfolding solar sails to collapsible heart stents. This project will add mathematical tools that allow industrial applications to employ cutting-edge research, from large-scale architectural structures to nano-scale robotics driven by origami mechanics. The tools from this project will help design self-foldable structures. Currently self-folding designs in engineering, architecture, and the biological sciences involve building physical models in a trial-and-error approach, wasting time and resources. The self-folding research provided by this project will allow designers to avoid pitfalls and tighten the design-to-realization process significantly. In addition to the research component, the PI shall organize a diverse range of educational activities including in-service teacher training and education, undergraduate mentoring and preparation for graduate school; high-school and undergraduate classes on the mathematics of folding; for the public, general-audience articles, lectures, and exhibitions.

One approach is to transform a given rigid folding of a crease pattern into a kinematically equivalent rigid folding with fewer degrees of freedom. The PI has proposed such a transform and will develop others. Key to all of this, however, is gaining a better understanding of rigid origami configuration spaces, which are algebraically complicated and not well understood. The project seeks to understand, and exploit, local-to-global behavior that is present in many known examples of rigid origami. In these examples approximating the configuration space near the origin (the unfolded state) leads to exact equations for the global configuration space. Formulating rigid origami configuration spaces in this way will add insight into the general field of flexible polyhedral surfaces, as well as provide the data needed to prove the feasibility of origami crease pattern transforms and design reliably self-foldable origami mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former compares geometric measurements (such as volume and surface area) while the latter recovers the shape of geometric figures using local versions of these measurements. The two types of problems are inherently connected. This project will exploit this connection to seek answers to either isoperimetric problems or Minkowski problems in various settings when answers to one exist while answers to the other remain elusive. Although these problems originate from a geometric background, their applications extend beyond mathematics into engineering and design, including areas like antenna reflector design and urban planning. The principal investigator will organize a series of events and workshops at local science museums, community centers, and schools, involving high school teachers and students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. These events and workshops aim to expose the fun and exploratory side of the principal investigator?s research and mathematics in general to students early in their educational careers, raise society's awareness and interest in mathematics, and promote mathematics among historically underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The existence of solutions to the dual Minkowski problem (that characterizes dual curvature measures)  in the original symmetric case has been largely settled (by the principal investigator and his collaborators) through techniques from geometry and analysis. This naturally leads to conjectures involving isoperimetric problems connected to the dual Minkowski problem. Such conjectured isoperimetric inequalities are also connected to an intriguing question behind many other conjectures in convexity: how does certain symmetry improve estimates? The principal investigator will also study Minkowski problems and isoperimetric inequalities coming from affine geometry. Special cases of these isoperimetric inequalities are connected to an affine version of the sharp fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren-Lieb. The techniques involved in studying these questions are from Convex Geometric Analysis and PDE. In the last few decades (particularly the last two), there has been a community-wide effort to extend results in the theory of convex bodies to their counterparts in the space of log-concave functions. In this project, the principal investigator will also continue his past work to extend dual curvature measures, their Minkowski problems, and associated isoperimetric inequality to the space of log-concave functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hyperbolic manifolds are multi-dimensional shapes for which, when one stands at any point and looks in any pair of directions, the shape looks like a saddle. While such shapes can be hard to visualize in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, they are abundant in the study of geometry and represent the simplest examples of an important phenomenon called negative curvature. In contrast to other types of shapes, hyperbolic manifolds benefit from rich connections to algebra, via an invariant called the fundamental group, and dynamics, due to the chaotic nature of certain naturally associated dynamical systems. Therefore, in the study of these manifolds, a wide array of perspectives and techniques can be employed. The PI will leverage tools originating from different areas of mathematics to study rigidity phenomena for these manifolds.  The PI will also engage in building support networks for junior mathematicians, organize conferences and speaker series, and engage in outreach efforts for middle and high school students across Oklahoma.  <br/> <br/>The PI?s research centers on improving our understanding of rigidity and flexibility phenomenon for the fundamental groups of finite volume real and complex hyperbolic manifolds. The projects fall loosely into three categories of rigidity: measure rigidity, representation rigidity, and spectral rigidity. Specifically, over the lifetime of this grant, the PI will work on the following general problems: 1) developing tools to explore rigidity for semiclassical measures on hyperbolic manifolds, 2) exploring the extent to which geodesic submanifolds force rigidity phenomena for representations of fundamental groups of real and complex hyperbolic manifolds, and 3) understanding the extent to which (simple) length spectral rigidity holds for hyperbolic surfaces.

Intuitively one may think of positive curvature in the following manner: On the surface of Earth any two longitudes from the North pole appear to bend towards each other and indeed they meet at the South pole. This is true of all points on Earth if we imagine longitudes emanating from each point. Because of this, we say that the surface of Earth has positive curvature everywhere. By the same token, a saddle has negative curvature at the point where the rider sits while a flat table has zero curvature. In higher dimensions, matters are far less visually apparent. One deals almost exclusively with equations and sophisticated geometrical techniques that describe the curvature of manifolds, a term that refers to objects that, roughly speaking, have no sharp edges. Manifolds of bounded size are called compact manifolds.  One of the great mysteries in the study of positive or non-negative curvature is the dearth of examples. The techniques at hand are few and the number of known examples remains relatively small.  In this project the PI aims to study positively and non-negatively curved manifolds with proposed new methods of construction. The project also presents several broader impact activities including outreach, inclusivity, and undergraduate research.<br/> <br/> <br/>The study of manifolds with positive or non-negative sectional curvature has a long history with roots as far back as Felix Klein in the late nineteenth century.  The PI's work for many years has been to try and construct new examples while attempting to prove rigidity theorems in the presence of additional hypotheses.  Complete manifolds of non-negative sectional curvature fall into two broad categories: compact and non-compact. In the non-compact case we have the beautiful Soul theorem of Cheeger and Gromoll:  A complete, non-compact manifold with non-negative sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to a vector bundle over a closed, totally convex submanifold.  In the compact case, Gromov's theorem restricts the topology sharply:  The total Betti number is bounded by a constant depending only on the dimension.  Beyond these theorems the question remains: which closed manifolds admit metrics of non-negative sectional curvature?  In this project the PI continues their recently successful research program on constructing new manifolds with non-negative curvature as well as a new proposed method for constructing positive curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The time lapse can be in a single, discrete time step or a continuous time flow. One natural way in which dynamical systems can be considered the same, called conjugacy, is through change of coordinates. That is, two dynamical systems are conjugate if there is an equivalence between the spaces which connects the way in which time steps are made. One of the central classification questions in dynamics is to classify dynamical systems up to conjugacy. This question has variations based on what it means for two systems to be equivalent, usually taking the forms of measurable, continuous and smooth equivalences. The goal of the proposal is to study the classification question from various perspectives, including generalizing the notion of a dynamical system to a group action, understanding possible values for conjugacy invariants and relaxing the notion of conjugacy to allow for time reparameterization. The proposal also includes work with students at various levels to deepen the collective understanding.<br/><br/>The proposal aims to capitalize on momentum in 3 key areas: smooth rigidity for actions of abelian groups and higher-rank semisimple Lie groups, Kakutani equivalence for flows and group actions, and flexibility for conjugacy invariants. Each of these questions is related to a classification question, the first working toward the Katok-Spatzier conjecture and Zimmer program, the second being an extension of results about Kakutani equivalence of parabolic flows to the setting of abelian group actions, and the third being a natural extension of the seminal work of Erchonko-Katok describing the possible values for topological and metric entropy for geodesic flows on surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, they are used to describe the orbital paths of satellites. Taking the satellite scenario, for example, a natural question to ask is whether there are recurring orbits that a satellite can traverse. Contact homology offers a systematic way to explore the geometric features of these contact manifolds. In the satellite scenario, one can gain deep insights into all possible orbital paths of satellites by analyzing recurring satellite orbits. Contact homology has been highly successful in distinguishing different contact manifolds. This project aims to refine our understanding of contact manifolds using an enhanced approach based on contact homology. Furthermore, the PI intends to apply the techniques developed in this process to study other types of spaces beyond contact manifolds, such as spaces with symmetries. Symmetries play a crucial role in many aspects of daily life. For instance, ensuring that machine learning models treat people fairly, irrespective of their gender or race, reflects a key symmetry requirement. To address these issues, the PI will conduct an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program focused on developing symmetrical neural networks to mitigate gender and racial biases.<br/><br/>Symplectic Field Theory, introduced two decades ago, aims to provide invariants for symplectic and contact manifolds. It encompasses essential concepts such as cylindrical contact homology, contact homology, chain homotopy types of contact differential graded algebras (dga), and linearized contact homology. The projects presented here revolve around the foundational aspects of Symplectic Field Theory. The primary challenge addressed by the Principal Investigator (PI) concerns achieving transversality while preserving symmetries to derive the desired algebraic formula. Various tools and techniques, including obstruction bundle gluing and evaluation maps for cylindrical contact homology, and semi-global Kuranishi structures for contact homology, have been introduced or employed by the PI. The project applies these tools to investigate two specific invariants: the chain homotopy type of contact dga and linearized contact homology. Furthermore, the PI has developed a new tool, the semi-global Kuranishi structure for clean intersections, which lies between obstruction bundle gluing and semi-global Kuranishi structures. This tool offers increased computational efficiency and bridges seemingly unrelated techniques. The project also aims to establish a Smith-type rank inequality related to the Floer homology of the fixed point set, contributing to the understanding of the L-space conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another major direction of research revolves around the study of an evolution equation for geometric spaces known as Ricci flow, which evolves a given shape in a continuous fashion aiming to make it as round as possible. In this process, singularities may develop, and understanding their nature is a central problem in the field. This project will investigate the nature of singularities that form as time goes to infinity, in the case when the geometric evolution exists for all positive time.

The main difficulty is that in the cases which are not already understood, the evolving metrics are volume-collapsed as time approaches infinity, and the expected limiting space is lower-dimensional. The second project is about understanding (1,1) cohomology classes on the boundary of the Kahler cone of a Calabi-Yau manifold, and the singularities of the closed positive currents that these classes contain.

While even heuristic connections can be fruitful, mirror symmetry provides a fascinating direct connection, originating from modern physics, between algebraic geometry and symplectic topology that has led to major advances in both areas. Algebraic geometry is a rich and classical field of mathematics that explores shapes called algebraic varieties described by polynomial equations. Symplectic topology is a younger area that studies shapes built from a geometric formalism for classical mechanics by packaging solutions to certain partial differential equations into algebraic invariants. This project aims to deepen our understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomenon by building on new insights in a special case where the algebraic varieties are particularly symmetric. This will be done with the aim of verifying new cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture, exploring structural aspects of a symplectic invariant known as the Fukaya category, and investigating arithmetic aspects of mirror symmetry. The project will also involve undergraduate research projects on combinatorial problems coming from mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The first technical goal of the project is to further develop functorial aspects of the toric homological mirror symmetry equivalence by enlarging the list of sheaves and functors that can be provably described in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds and geometric operations on them.

In the other direction, the project will seek to leverage the geometric flexibility of the Fukaya category to construct new group actions on derived categories of toric varieties. The project will also aim to determine when symplectic fibrations can be described in terms of cornered Liouville sectors resulting in a gluing formula for their Fukaya categories.

This type of surfaces appears in many places in physics, but is also of intrinsic interest.

In higher dimensions, those geometric structures are very rare, and perhaps too rigid compared to the diversity of closed manifolds. In this project, the investigator proposes to consider a more general and flexible notion: minimal surfaces in (possibly infinite dimensional) homogeneous spaces, invariant under a geometric discrete group action. With this point of view, the investigator will explore a series of questions which relates minimal surfaces to geometric group theory and representation theory. A typical problem is the following: what group can act geometrically on a connected minimal surface in a Hilbert sphere?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fundamental ideas and concepts such as information, entropy, chaos and fractals have had a profound impact on our understanding of the world. Dynamical systems and ergodic theory have developed superb tools with applications to sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics, for example, has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is a highly developed, ancient yet superbly active field in mathematics. It studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogs, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces. Surveying the land for his principality, Gauss developed the fundamental notions of geodesics and curvature, laying the groundwork for modern differential geometry. It has close links with physics and applied areas like computer vision or the more current geometric and topological data analysis. Geometry and dynamics are closely connected. Indeed, important dynamical systems such as the geodesic flow come from geometry, and conversely one can use geometric tools to study dynamics. One main goal of this project is to study symmetries of dynamical systems, especially when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. The quest is to study these systems via unexpected symmetries. Important examples arise from geometry when the space contains many flat subspaces.  Under additional assumptions, one can classify such spaces. Finally, group theory is introduced in both dynamics and geometry via the group of symmetries of a geometry or dynamical system. The principal investigator will continue training a new generation of researchers in mathematics, and students at all levels in their mathematical endeavors. This project includes support for research training opportunities for graduate students and summer research experiences for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This project will investigate rigidity phenomena in geometry and dynamics, especially actions of higher rank abelian and semi-simple Lie groups and their lattices. The latter is part of the Zimmer program. Particular emphasis will be put on hyperbolic actions of such groups. As higher-rank semisimple Lie groups and their lattices contain higher-rank abelian groups, the classification and rigidity problems for the abelian and semi-simple cases are closely related, with abundant cross-fertilization. The goal is the classification of such actions. Closely related are the study of automorphism groups of geometric structures.  A further goal is to understand topological joinings of lattice actions on Furstenberg boundaries and the related problem of classifying discrete subgroups in semisimple ie groups with higher Prasad-Rapinchuk rank. Investigations in geometry will address higher-rank Riemannian manifolds and their classification, introducing novel methods. The dynamics of geodesic and frame flows will also be studied, with investigations of discrete subgroups of Lie groups for rank rigidity and measure properties. Besides establishing new results, the principal investigator also strives to find and introduce novel methods for investigating these problems which will lend themselves to applications in other areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Program's main theme is Geometric Analysis. This is an important field of mathematics with great impact and applications to many other parts of mathematics and physics, which uses and discovers tools in analysis and partial differential equations to address problems which originate in geometry and physics. This Program will bring together a large number of experts in different facets of geometric analysis, and will attract a large and diverse spectrum of participants from North America and beyond. A major goal of this Program is to expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to the recent developments in this important field of mathematics. This grant will provide financial support for junior US-based mathematicians (graduate students and postdocs), particularly women and members of other under-represented groups, to participate in the Program, by helping cover their travel and lodging expenses.<br/><br/>The last few years have seen spectacular progress on a variety of very difficult geometric problems, including the spectacular solution of the Poincare conjecture using Ricci Flow, and the solution of the Kahler-Einstein problem for Fano manifolds. The interplay between nonlinear analysis and geometry has long proved to be extremely fruitful. Generally speaking, problems involving the curvature tensor of a Riemannian or Kahler metric usually translate to nonlinear PDEs, which may present a formidable challenge from the analytic viewpoint, but which often can be attacked using the underlying geometric structure. The broad themes of the 6 Thematic Workshops will be: geometric flows; complex and Kahler geometry; special geometries in dimension 6,7,8; moduli spaces and singularities of geometric objects.

Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The theme of the 2024 conference is the immensely rich connection between Poisson geometry and representation theory, which dates back to the original works of Sophus Lie on the realization of continuous symmetry groups by canonical transformations.

Number theory is an ancient branch of mathematics concerned with the whole numbers and primes.  Some basic results in number theory are the infinitude of primes and the formula which gives all the Pythagorean triples.  Topology is the study of shapes, but one doesn't remember details like length and angles;  the surfaces of a donut and a coffee mug are famously indistinguishable to a topologist.  An overarching theme in topology is to invent invariants to distinguish among shapes.  For instance, a pair of pants is different from a straw because ""number of holes"" is an invariant which assigns different values to them (2 and 1 respectively, but one has to be precise about what a hole is).  The notion of ""hole"" can be generalized to higher dimensions:  a sphere has no 1-dimensional hole, but it does have a 2-dimensional hole and even a 3-dimensional hole (known as the Hopf fibration, discovered in 1931).  There are ""spheres"" in every dimension, and the determination of how many holes each one has is a major unsolved problem in topology.  Lately, the topologists' methods have encroached into the domain of number theory.  In particular the branch of number theory known as p-adic geometry, involving strange number systems allowing for decimal places going off infinitely far to the left, has made an appearance.  The principal investigator will draw upon his expertise in p-adic geometry to make contributions to the counting-holes-in-spheres problem.  He will also organize conferences and workshops with the intent of drawing together number theorists and topologists together, as currently these two realms are somewhat siloed from each other.  Finally, the principal investigator plans to train his four graduate students in methods related to this project.<br/><br/>The device which counts the number of holes in a shape is called the ""homotopy group"".  Calculating the homotopy groups of the spheres is notoriously difficult and interesting at the same time.   There is a divide-and-conquer approach to doing this known as chromatic homotopy theory, which replaces the sphere with its K(n)-localized version.  Here K(n) is the Morava K-theory spectrum.  Work in progress by the principal investigator and collaborators has identified the homotopy groups of the K(n)-local sphere up to a torsion subgroup.   The techniques used involve formal groups, p-adic geometry, and especially perfectoid spaces, which are certain fractal-like entities invented in 2012 by Fields Medalist Peter Scholze.  The next step in the project is to calculate the Picard group of the K(n)-local category, using related techniques.  After this, the principal investigator will turn his attention to the problem known as the ""chromatic splitting conjecture"", which has to do with iterated localizations of the sphere at different K(n).  This is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle required to assemble the homotopy groups of the spheres from their K(n)-local analogues.
