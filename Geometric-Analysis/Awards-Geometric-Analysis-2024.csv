Elliptic differential equations govern the equilibrium configurations of various physical phenomena, for instance, those arising from minimization problems for natural energy functionals. Examples include the shape of free-hanging bridges, the shape of soap bubbles, and the sound of drums. Elliptic differential equations are also used to quantify the degree to which physical objects are bent or distorted, with far-reaching implications and applications in geometry and topology. The proposed research focuses on the regularity of solutions to such equations. Questions to be addressed include the following: Do non-smooth points (singularities) exist? How large can the set of singularities be? What is the behavior of the solution near a singularity? Is it possible to perturb the underlying environment in order to eliminate the singularity? The project will also provide opportunities for the professional development of graduate students, both via individual mentoring and via the organization of a directed learning seminar on geometric analysis and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical objectives of the project are twofold. First, the principal investigator will study unique continuation for solutions to elliptic partial differential equations, with a focus on quantitative estimates on the size and structure of the singular set of these solutions. A second topic for consideration is the regularity theory for generalized minimal submanifolds (a generalized notion of smooth submanifolds which arise as critical points for the area functional under local deformations). In particular, the principal investigator will study branch singular points in the interior as well as at the boundary of a generalized minimal submanifold, under an area-minimizing or stability assumption. Research on the latter topic, which can be viewed as a non-linear analogue of quantitative unique continuation for elliptic equations, requires the integration of ideas from geometric measure theory, partial differential equations and geometric analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scientific activities of this Program will consist of 6 week-long Thematic Workshops, a two-week long Summer School (Seminaire de Mathematiques Superieures SMS), and two Aisenstadt Chairs Lectures. The Program's main theme is Geometric Analysis. This is an important field of mathematics with great impact and applications to many other parts of mathematics and physics, which uses and discovers tools in analysis and partial differential equations to address problems which originate in geometry and physics. This Program will bring together a large number of experts in different facets of geometric analysis, and will attract a large and diverse spectrum of participants from North America and beyond. A major goal of this Program is to expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to the recent developments in this important field of mathematics. This grant will provide financial support for junior US-based mathematicians (graduate students and postdocs), particularly women and members of other under-represented groups, to participate in the Program, by helping cover their travel and lodging expenses.<br/><br/>The last few years have seen spectacular progress on a variety of very difficult geometric problems, including the spectacular solution of the Poincare conjecture using Ricci Flow, and the solution of the Kahler-Einstein problem for Fano manifolds. The interplay between nonlinear analysis and geometry has long proved to be extremely fruitful. Generally speaking, problems involving the curvature tensor of a Riemannian or Kahler metric usually translate to nonlinear PDEs, which may present a formidable challenge from the analytic viewpoint, but which often can be attacked using the underlying geometric structure. The broad themes of the 6 Thematic Workshops will be: geometric flows; complex and Kahler geometry; special geometries in dimension 6,7,8; moduli spaces and singularities of geometric objects. The SMS summer school will be on ""Flows and Variational Methods in Riemannian and Complex Geometry: Classical and Modern Methods"", and will feature 10 mini-courses by well-known experts in the field. The Aisenstadt Chairs will be Simon Brendle and Panagiota Daskalopoulos.The Thematic Program webpage can be found here: https://www.crmath.ca/en/activities/#/type/activity/id/3880<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former compares geometric measurements (such as volume and surface area) while the latter recovers the shape of geometric figures using local versions of these measurements. The two types of problems are inherently connected. This project will exploit this connection to seek answers to either isoperimetric problems or Minkowski problems in various settings when answers to one exist while answers to the other remain elusive. Although these problems originate from a geometric background, their applications extend beyond mathematics into engineering and design, including areas like antenna reflector design and urban planning. The principal investigator will organize a series of events and workshops at local science museums, community centers, and schools, involving high school teachers and students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. These events and workshops aim to expose the fun and exploratory side of the principal investigator?s research and mathematics in general to students early in their educational careers, raise society's awareness and interest in mathematics, and promote mathematics among historically underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The existence of solutions to the dual Minkowski problem (that characterizes dual curvature measures)  in the original symmetric case has been largely settled (by the principal investigator and his collaborators) through techniques from geometry and analysis. This naturally leads to conjectures involving isoperimetric problems connected to the dual Minkowski problem. Such conjectured isoperimetric inequalities are also connected to an intriguing question behind many other conjectures in convexity: how does certain symmetry improve estimates? The principal investigator will also study Minkowski problems and isoperimetric inequalities coming from affine geometry. Special cases of these isoperimetric inequalities are connected to an affine version of the sharp fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren-Lieb. The techniques involved in studying these questions are from Convex Geometric Analysis and PDE. In the last few decades (particularly the last two), there has been a community-wide effort to extend results in the theory of convex bodies to their counterparts in the space of log-concave functions. In this project, the principal investigator will also continue his past work to extend dual curvature measures, their Minkowski problems, and associated isoperimetric inequality to the space of log-concave functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical analogues of eigenfunctions are standing waves, and the eigenvalues may be thought of as their corresponding frequencies. The interdependence between high-frequency eigenfunctions and the geometry of the manifold on which they live is central to a broad range of fields from quantum physics to number theory. Indeed, eigenfunctions are steady-state solutions to the Schrödinger equation, and their eigenvalues are the corresponding energies. To illustrate the connection to number theory, the task of accurately counting the number of eigenfunctions of a given frequency on the flat torus is equivalent to counting the number of ways an integer can be expressed as the sum of, say, two squares. This project aims to develop new tools to advance understanding in spectral asymptotics, whose interconnectedness to seemingly disparate areas of mathematics and science make its study particularly valuable. <br/><br/>As part of the research project, the PI intends to develop and use tools from microlocal analysis and the theory of Fourier integral operators to refine a variety of formulas describing the behavior of high-frequency eigenfunctions, and in particular describing what effect the underlying geometry has on these formulas. The PI intends to make advancements towards a conjecture on the remainder term of the Weyl law for products of manifolds, to develop a general multilinear theory of Fourier integral operators for use in both spectral asymptotics and geometric measure theory, and to further explore the connection between spectral quantities and the presence of corresponding geometric configurations in the manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary purpose of the award is to provide travel funding to allow early career scholars from the US to participate in the workshops and the semester program.<br/><br/>Highly symmetric manifolds traditionally play a central role in mathematics, ranging from number theory to dynamics to geometry. This research topic centers on a program put forward by Zimmer and Gromov to study manifolds with large groups of symmetries, with the general idea that such manifolds should arise from natural algebraic and geometric constructions. Investigations in this area are often spurred by sudden discovery of or deepening of connections to other areas of mathematics. Recent new developments have been occurring with  breakneck speed.  Particularly important have been deepening connections to low dimensional topology, to homogeneous and hyperbolic dynamics as well as novel connections to operator algebras, and to classical work on characterizations of Lie groups among connected topological groups. The concentrated activity around this special term and the workshops funded in part by this grant are needed to capture this momentum and spur further progress.

The study of surfaces has surprising applications throughout many fields of mathematics and physics. Consequently, the project lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines. In addition to cutting edge mathematical research, the project will promote the progress of science and mathematics through different workshops aimed at graduate students as well as community outreach events.

The cornerstone for the approach is the role of Slodowy slices for Higgs bundles. Specifically, the PI aims to establish Anosov properties of surface group representations associated to Slodowy slices in the Higgs bundle moduli space.
