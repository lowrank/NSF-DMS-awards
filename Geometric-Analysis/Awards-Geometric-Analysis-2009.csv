The PI proposes projects related to this goal with an emphasis on the following:<br/>a) understanding the bounded cohomology groups of locally symmetric spaces of noncompact type,<br/>b) finding properties of geodesics that characterize symmetric spaces of compact type, and c)Zimmer's program of classifying actions of lattice subgroups of higher rank noncompact simple Lie groups on closed manifolds.<br/><br/>   Symmetry appears throughout forms in nature such as animals, crystals, and snowflakes.  Mathematicians exploit symmetry on a regular basis in their work since symmetric spaces and systems are usually the easiest to understand theoretically.  Moreover, a detailed understanding of these spaces and systems frequently leads to a better understanding of less symmetric objects.  The PI will investigate the interplay between properties of geodesics (or shortest paths between points) in a space and symmetry exhibited by that space.  For example, since the surface of the Earth is not perfectly round, its geodesics should differ from those of an idealized sphere.<br/><br/>"

This project is to study two classes of problems involving scalar curvature and Ricci curvature. <br/>The first class of problems concerns compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary whose scalar or Ricci curvature is positive. <br/>It is an important problem to understand the boundary effect of these curvature conditions. These problems are related to understanding quasi-local mass in general relativity. A key specific case is whether a compact 3-manifold with scalar curvature bigger or equal to six whose boundary is totally geodesic and isometric to the standard two dimensional sphere is isometric to the three dimensional hemisphere. These problems will also serve as great source of inspiration and lead to many other fascinating problems. Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature have been studied a lot and we have a good knowledge about them. Riemannian manifolds with a negative lower bound for Ricci curvature are more complicated and less understood. The author intends to study them by working on some rigidity and comparison problems involving asymptotic invariants such as entropy and the spectrum of the Laplace operator.<br/>   <br/>This project aims to study some fundamental problems involving scalar and Ricci curvature. Progress will deepen our understanding of curvature and geometry. These problems have interactions with other areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry, probability and potential theory. Some of these problems are closely related to theoretical physics, particularly general relativity and their solutions will enhance our understanding of spacetime.  This project will also contribute to the training of graduate students and post-docs in the area of geometric analysis. <br/><br/>"

Clelland will continue the study of sub-Finsler geometry, originally introduced by Clelland and Christopher Moseley as a natural generalization of sub-Riemannian geometry with applications to control theory.  In addition, Clelland will study the geometry of the more general category of control-affine systems (system with ""drift""), with particular attention to the geometry of systems of non-constant type, where the drift vector field vanishes along a distinguished submanifold of the state space.  The notion of a ""t-codistribution,"" originally introduced by Elkin, is expected to facilitate the application of Cartan's method of equivalence to this important case.  This study will eventually include the introduction and analysis of metric structures akin to sub- Riemannian and/or sub-Finsler geometry for such systems, with applications to the study of optimal control for control-affine systems.  Clelland will continue her work on the geometry of Backlund transformations, with emphasis on the geometric significance of the arbitrary parameter that appears in many (but not all) Backlund transformations, as well as the classification of ""auto-Backlund transformations"" for hyperbolic Monge-Ampere PDEs, which relate solutions of one hyperbolic Monge-Ampere PDE to additional solutions of the same PDE.<br/><br/>Differential equations have an enormous range of applications, from engineering and physics to biology and finance, just to name a few.  A common theme in all the proposed projects is the use of geometric techniques to study structural features of differential equations which may be obscured by the expression of an equation in a particular choice of coordinates.  This approach, pioneered in the early 20th century by Elie Cartan, has enjoyed great success in furthering the understanding of many types of differential equations and their solutions.  With the proposed research on sub-Finsler geometry and control-affine systems, Clelland will apply these techniques to the study of problems related to control theory, whose applications include areas such as robotics and quantum computing.  With the proposed research on Backlund transformations, Clelland will study problems related to integrable systems, whose applications include efficient signal propagation over long distances with minimal distortion in signal quality.<br/><br/>"

The next series of conferences will have six primary sponsoring<br/>universities: The University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Rice University, the University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and Texas Christian University. The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states. The conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. Summaries of talks with notation of important results have been publicly reported for some time and will continue similarly in the future.<br/> <br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.<br/>In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a pilot project to foster research opportunities for junior faculty.<br/> <br/>"

These are natural generalizations of Calabi-Yau manifolds and are of mathematical interest in their own right. In one class important for string theory, the canonical structure one seeks on a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold is governed by a ``warp factor equation'' that couples a balanced Hermitian metric to an anti self-dual connection of a vector bundle. When the manifold is Kahler Calabi-Yau and the vector bundle is the tangent bundle, this system reduces to the Calabi conjecture for Ricci-flat metrics. The mathematical understanding of generalized geometries is still in its nascent stage.  The purpose of this proposal is to develop this field further, into a full-fledged extension of Kahler Calabi-Yau geometries. We will focus on the following tightly interconnected problems: constructing new solutions to string theory in this class; characterizing the deformations and specifically the moduli of these spaces; understanding ""worldsheet  instantons"" and their enumerative geometry in these manifolds; and an understanding of ""generalized calibrations,"" the analog of calibrated submanifolds of special holonomy manifolds.<br/><br/>The proposed project is to study the mathematics of a new class of geometric objects called ""generalized geometries"", and the appearance of this  class in string theory. Mathematically, these structures provide interesting and natural  extensions of a well-known class of geometric constructions in Calabi-Yau geometry. Physically, these extensions  are known to be required  to capture essential features of particle physics and cosmology, and  will push string theorists closer to the goal of making contact with observations. The project is a multi-institutional and interdisciplinary effort,  involving mathematicians and physicists at Brandeis, Harvard, and Texas A&M."

On one hand, the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture has led to work by Kontsevich, Soibelman, Gross, Siebert, Zharkov and others to view mirror symmetry in terms of integral affine manifolds and tropical data on them. On the other hand, Mikhalkin's pioneering work on holomorphic curve counting using tropical geometry demonstrated that Gromov-Witten invariants were accessible by tropical methods, and increasingly, tropical methods are being seen as a tool for studying algebraic varieties. The aim of this FRG is to make further connections between tropical geometry and mirror symmetry with the aim of creating a new synthesis of these two fields. Some of the research directions of this project include the study of mirror symmetry for Fanos and manifolds of general type;  Lagrangians and SYZ fibrations in this new setting; non-archimedean integrable systems in hyper-Kaehler manifolds; tropical enumerative geometry of real and complex curves; the development of non-commutative Hodge theory, tropical homology and its relation to classical homology and the Hodge conjecture; Welschinger invariants, open Gromov-Witten theory and their applications to mirror symmetry. These should greatly extend the realm of mirror symmetry and applications of tropical geometry to the classical algebro-geometric world. Members of this FRG include: Ricardo Castano-Bernard (Kansas State), Mark Gross (San Diego),  Ilia Itenberg (Strasbourg), Ludmil Katzarkov (Miami), Viatcheslav Kharlamov (Strasbourg); Maxim Kontsevich  (I.H.E.S & Miami),  Diego Matessi (Alessandria); Grigory Mikhalkin (Geneva), Yan Soibelman (Kansas State), Jake Solomon (Hebrew U),  Ilia Zharkov (Kansas State).<br/><br/>During past 25 years there has been intensive interaction between string theory and geometry which has led to a creation of entirely new mathematical areas. String theory also suggested that ""conventional""<br/>geometry emerges from the quantum theory at certain limits. Then various ""string dualities"" give equivalent but mathematically very different descriptions of the same physical quantities. A beautiful and deep example illustrating all these ideas is mirror symmetry. An important component of this project is to expand the existing collaborative links of the FRG members exploring tropical methods of mirror symmetry into a solid collaborative network of postdocs, graduate students and experts in an integrated research-training environment. This includes the organization of workshops, summer schools and local seminar series at the local FRG nodes. International exchange of young and senior researchers is one of the key aspects of this project bringing together well-established groups in Europe and in the U.S. The participation of mathematicians and young researchers from underrepresented groups will be promoted."

Many of the problems in<br/>symplectic geometry, like the Gromov-Witten theory and the<br/>Symplectic Field Theory, are based on the study of the moduli<br/>spaces of the first order nonlinear elliptic equations.

This general Fredholm theory has all the properties of<br/>the classical Fredholm theory, but is more flexible and<br/>applicable to problems with lack of compactness. In the project,<br/>the general Fredholm theory on polyfolds is applied to the<br/>Gromow-Witten theory and to the Symplectic Field Theory.

The choice of an auxiliary almost complex<br/>structure J determines a specially interesting class of such<br/>surfaces, namely those that are J-holomorphic.  Using them it is<br/>possible to build many interesting homology theories, such as<br/>quantum cohomology or symplectic field theory.

The PI proposes two different methods for exploring rigidity and constructing new examples of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative and positive sectional curvature.  The first method begins with the question: classify the left-invariant metrics with nonnegative curvature on each compact Lie group.  Almost all known constructions of nonnegative curvature begin with a bi-invariant metric, so answering this question would help us measure the rigidity of the known constructions, and could lead to new examples of nonnegatively curved manifolds with (at least points of) positive curvature.  The second method is related to past research in which the PI developed conditions under which vector bundles admit nonnegative curvature.  More precisely, if a vector bundle admits nonnegative curvature, then a fundamental differential inequality relates the three curvatures which are visible at points of its soul: the curvature of the soul, the curvature of the connection in the normal bundle of the soul, and the curvature of planes orthogonal to the soul.  Conversely, if a vector bundle admits structure which strictly satisfy this inequality, then the unit sphere bundle admits positive sectional curvature.  The PI proposes to use this theorem to find new examples, obstructions, and rigidity theorems for metrics with nonnegative (respectively positive) curvature on vector bundles (respectively sphere bundles).<br/><br/>Differential Geometry provides the mathematical language for precisely describing Einstein's theory of relativity, particle physics, and high dimensional curved shapes (called manifolds).  The PI's proposed work within this field involves the study of manifolds with positive curvature, which is a visually natural restriction on the way in which a manifold curves about in space.  Past examples come from Lie groups, which are indispensable tools in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, computer animation, and other disciplines in which simplification is achieved through symmetry. <br/>The search for new examples of manifolds with positive curvature has a long history, yet frustratingly few examples have been found.  The PI proposes substantially new methods for constructing more examples, which could thereby lead to a better general understanding of the relationship between curvature and global shape.<br/>"

In the weekly NCGA seminars (noncommutative geometry and arithmetic seminars) and at the final conference main emphasis will be given to describe the link that has recently emerged connecting a well-known quantum statistical dynamical system in noncommutative geometry (the BC-system), the corresponding noncommutative motive (BC-endomotive) and a newly developed algebraic-geometric theory of schemes  over the absolute point.<br/><br/>The direct impact of NSF funding is that of supporting and training  a significant number of junior U.S. researchers (junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students), who will gain the opportunity to participate in the program. Mentoring and training of junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students is a central part of every JAMI program, as is helping these individuals develop networks that include the world's leading researchers. To accomplish this, the PI's have  recruited a broad and diverse participant group, paying particular attention to women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. In light of several very recent results, which reveal surprising new connections between the fields of Number Theory and Noncommutative Geometry,  the PIs  expect that the research broadcast by this program will have a major impact on the development of these fields, under a unified methodology. The rapidly increasing interest in the area of ``Noncommutative Arithmetic Geometry'' has led the PI's to the organization of several recent workshops, which generated collaborative work between theoretical mathematicians and physicists and have attracted the interest of an impressive number of  graduate students and young researchers across different fields.<br/>"

The principal aim of the project is to gain a deeper understanding of the large scale geometry of various classes of metric spaces through the study of higher-dimensional isoperimetric inequalities. The project's first and main part focuses on simply connected geodesic metric spaces of non-positive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov, called Hadamard spaces. In this setting, a particular goal is to establish connections between the behavior of higher-dimensional isoperimetric functions (and other filling invariants) and various notions of rank. If successful, the research will result in an answer to Gromov's conjecture on linear isoperimetric inequalities which asserts Euclidean behavior in the dimensions below and linear behavior in the dimensions above the Euclidean rank in a proper cocompact Hadamard space. The proposed approach relies on methods from geometric measure theory and analysis on metric spaces, in particular on the notion of metric currents, the theory of which has recently been developed by Ambrosio and Kirchheim. An important second part of the project will thus be to further develop the theory of metric currents, which provides a suitable notion of surfaces in a metric space and also gives powerful tools in the study of many other problems in geometric analysis, e.g. such involving energy minimization. Isoperimetric inequalities also play a fundamental role in geometric group theory. For finitely presented groups one-dimensional isoperimetric functions measure the complexity of the word problem and have been extensively studied over the past 15 years. The study of higher-dimensional isoperimetric functions, on the other hand, has only recently become a very active field of research. A last part of the project investigates filling problems in the context of nilpotent Lie groups.<br/><br/>The study of isoperimetric problems has a long history. Not only has it inspired many mathematicians, but it has also led to many new theories in mathematics. In the most classical setting-known already to the Ancient Greeks-the isoperimetric inequality asserts that a closed curve in the plane encloses an area no larger than that of a disc of the same circumference. Higher-dimensional analogues are concerned with the question of how well a k-dimensional closed surface can be filled with a (k+1)-dimensional surface. Filling problems appear in many different fields of mathematics, including analysis, geometry, probability theory and group theory. The aim of the present project is to study the effects that curvature has on the isoperimetric filling problem. The investigation will in particular lead to a deeper understanding of the geometry of non-positively curved singular spaces. Such arise for example in the mathematical study of billiard trajectories. The project proposes to use methods from the field of geometric measure theory, dealing with the study of singular surfaces. This theory was to a large extent inspired by Plauteau's problem, which asks for the existence of a minimal surface (or a soap film) with prescribed boundary. Higher-dimensional analogues of this question were the starting point in the development of the theory of currents, which nowadays has many applications going far beyond Plateau's problem.<br/><br/>"

On one hand, the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture has led to work by Kontsevich, Soibelman, Gross, Siebert, Zharkov and others to view mirror symmetry in terms of integral affine manifolds and tropical data on them. On the other hand, Mikhalkin's pioneering work on holomorphic curve counting using tropical geometry demonstrated that Gromov-Witten invariants were accessible by tropical methods, and increasingly, tropical methods are being seen as a tool for studying algebraic varieties. The aim of this FRG is to make further connections between tropical geometry and mirror symmetry with the aim of creating a new synthesis of these two fields. Some of the research directions of this project include the study of mirror symmetry for Fanos and manifolds of general type;  Lagrangians and SYZ fibrations in this new setting; non-archimedean integrable systems in hyper-Kaehler manifolds; tropical enumerative geometry of real and complex curves; the development of non-commutative Hodge theory, tropical homology and its relation to classical homology and the Hodge conjecture; Welschinger invariants, open Gromov-Witten theory and their applications to mirror symmetry. These should greatly extend the realm of mirror symmetry and applications of tropical geometry to the classical algebro-geometric world.

Then various ""string dualities"" give equivalent but mathematically very different descriptions of the same physical quantities. A beautiful and deep example illustrating all these ideas is mirror symmetry. An important component of this project is to expand the existing collaborative links of the FRG members exploring tropical methods of mirror symmetry into a solid collaborative network of postdocs, graduate students and experts in an integrated research-training environment. This includes the organization of workshops, summer schools and local seminar series at the local FRG nodes. International exchange of young and senior researchers is one of the key aspects of this project bringing together well-established groups in Europe and in the U.S. The participation of mathematicians and young researchers from underrepresented groups will be promoted."

In the past five years, investigation on symplectic structures is extended to the category of generalized complex structures. In this proposal, the PI will develop a corresponding theory for contact 1-forms on odd-dimensional manifolds, with a focus on integrability and deformation. While the starting point of proposed theory is similar to that of generalized complex structures, the related concept on integrability and the subsequent deformation theory are expected to the substantially different.

A part of the project deals<br/>with noncommutative differential calculus which is one of the<br/>central tools in the above. By noncommutative differential<br/>calculus we mean the study of algebraic structures arising from<br/>the standard differential calculus on manifolds, defined in terms<br/>in such a way that is valid of the algebra of functions on a<br/>manifold and in such a way that is valid if this algebra is<br/>replaced by any algebra, commutative or not. This leads to the<br/>study of algebraic structures on Hochschild chain and cochain<br/>complexes of an algebra; those complexes play the role of<br/>differential forms and multivector fields, a development of works<br/>of Dolgushev-Tamarkin-Tsygan, Kontsevich-Soibelman, Costello,<br/>Lurie and other authors. The techniques of noncommutative<br/>calculus will be applied to obtain new index theorems and<br/>theorems about the determinant of the cohomology of elliptic<br/>systems, generalizing recent results of Beilinson. Also, the<br/>project will study a new object on a symplectic manifold that we<br/>call an oscillatory module. These objects are modules over<br/>deformed algebras of functions on a manifold, but with extra<br/>structures that make their category much closer to the Fukaya<br/>category. This extra structure is largely motivated by microlocal<br/>methods in partial differential equations, in particular the WKB<br/>method. This is a part of a series of works that try to<br/>understand mirror symmetry microlocally (Bressler-Soibelman,<br/>Kapustin-Witten, Nadler-Zaslow, Gukov-Witten, Tamarkin).<br/><br/>There are three related parts in the project: noncommutative<br/>calculus, index theory, and oscillatory modules. Noncommutative<br/>calculus is a theory that describes parts of the standard<br/>differential calculus in such a way that it can be applied in<br/>situations more general than that of an ordinary space, in<br/>particular when, for coordinates on our imaginary ""space"", the<br/>equation xy=yx is no longer required. Index theory is a part of<br/>the theory of differential equations that expresses the number of<br/>solutions of an equation in terms of the topology of the<br/>underlying space. Oscillatory modules are objects on geometric<br/>spaces that describe the motion of quantum particles on these<br/>spaces (in other words, they treat the space in question as the<br/>phase space of a quantum mechanical system). These objects are<br/>intended to be applied to study other invariants of these spaces,<br/>also physically motivated and much more complicated; they are<br/>called A-branes and describe the motion of a quantum string on<br/>our space.  They are called A-branes and are subject of much<br/>current research in mathematical physics and geometry. Let us<br/>finish by explaining why noncommutative calculus is natural for<br/>applications both in differential equations and in quantum<br/>mechanics. Indeed,if x and y are basic operations with<br/>functions, for example multiplication by some function and<br/>differentiation, then xy differs from yx, in the sense that, if<br/>you apply them in different orders, you get different<br/>results. Similarly, in quantum mechanics, if x is the position of<br/>a particle and y is its momentum, then xy differs from yx; this<br/>is a mathematical expression of the Heisenberg uncertainty<br/>principle.<br/>"

In the case of sectional curvature, this was initiated in the 1930's by Alexandrov, who gave a good notion of what it means for a singular space to have nonnegative sectional curvature.<br/>Recent work by the proposer, joint with Cedric Villani, together with related work by Karl-Theodor Sturm, has given a good notion of what it means for a singular space to have nonnegative Ricci curvature.  The proposed research will explore properties of spaces with nonnegative Ricci curvature or, more generally, with Ricci curvature bounded below.  In a different direction, the Ricci curvature gives a way to smooth out the geometry of a space, by means of the Ricci flow.  This flow was introduced by Richard Hamilton in the 1980's, who used it to characterize the topology of three-dimensional smooth spaces with nonnegative Ricci curvature.  Recently, Perelman has proved the biggest conjectures in three-dimensional topology, namely the Poincare Conjecture and Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, using Ricci flow.  Despite Perelman's great achievements, there are many open questions concerning the Ricci flow in dimension three and in higher dimensions.  The proposed research will address some of these questions.<br/>Another way that singular spaces arise is when a higher-dimensional space is foliated into lower dimensional spaces.  The parametrizing space for such a foliation is almost always topologically singular.<br/>Part of the proposed research is to do analysis on such spaces, or more precisely to prove a transverse index theorem.<br/><br/>There are<br/>various notions of curvature, which coincide in the traditional setting of two-dimensional surfaces in three-dimensional space.  For a higher dimensional smooth space, not necessarily living in a flat space, these different notions are called the sectional curvature, the Ricci curvature and the scalar curvature.  Each one is an averaging of the previous one, i.e. the Ricci curvature is an averaging of sectional curvature and the scalar curvature is an averaging of Ricci curvature. The Ricci curvature enters in physics through Einstein's equations of general relativity.<br/>Part of the work described above concerns ``optimal transport''.  This is the study of the optimal way to transport mass in a curved space. It was initiated by Monge in the 1780's and has had a revival in recent decades, with application to partial differential equations and applied mathematics.<br/>We have shown that it also has application in differential geometry.  Conversely, concepts from differential geometry have application to optimal transport.<br/><br/><br/>"

Higher Teichmueller<br/>spaces are connected components of the variety of representations<br/>of the fundamental group of a surface into semisimple Lie groups,<br/>which share essential properties with Teichmueller<br/>space. Classical Teichmueller space plays an important role in<br/>various fields of mathematics due to its rich structure and the<br/>fact that it is a smooth cover of the moduli space of Riemann<br/>surfaces.  For higher Teichmueller spaces many potentially<br/>interesting structures are yet to be discovered and the relation<br/>to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces still needs to be<br/>clarified. The proposed research focusses on identifying the<br/>geometric objects (similar to hyperbolic surfaces in the case of<br/>classical Teichmueller space) which are parametrized by higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces. These objects will then be used to define<br/>algebraic, geometric and dynamical structures on higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces, and we expect that they will help to<br/>construct a natural map from higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>classical Teichmueller space.<br/><br/>Teichmueller space is the space of all geometric surfaces with a<br/>fixed combinatorial type. Because it parametrizes all surfaces,<br/>Teichmueller space is a fundamental mathematical object which<br/>also plays an important role in theoretical physics. Every point<br/>in Teichmueller space corresponds to a tiling of the Euclidean<br/>plane, the two-dimensional sphere or in most cases the hyperbolic<br/>plane by one polygon and its images under subsequent reflections<br/>in the sides. (Nice pictures inspired by such tilings appear in<br/>M.C. Escher's work.) The combinatorial type of the surface is<br/>determined by the number of vertices of the polygon and the<br/>gluing data, but the geometry of the surface depends on the<br/>length of the sides and the angles at the vertices of the<br/>polygon. Teichmueller space is the example of a moduli space of a<br/>pattern (the tiling) with rich symmetries (the reflections in the<br/>side of the polygon). Such moduli spaces can be efficiently<br/>studied via the group generated by the symmetries of the<br/>pattern. Higher Teichmueller spaces are moduli spaces of more<br/>complicated patterns in higher dimensional spaces. However, the<br/>symmetry group of these patterns is the same as the symmetry<br/>group of the tilings associated to classical Teichmueller<br/>space. Therefore one expects higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>parametrize geometric objects which are not surfaces themselves,<br/>but closely related to surfaces. The proposed research focusses<br/>on identifying these geometric objects and studying their finer<br/>structure.<br/><br/>The project proposes various activities to involve graduate<br/>students in research and teaching, as for instance a yearly<br/>mathematical retreat for graduate students to study, explore and<br/>present a mathematical topic in a group, and small workshops with<br/>mini-courses which allow graduate students to get insight into<br/>the working of modern research collaborations.<br/>"

The proposed research in analysis on metric spaces has two focal points: bilipschitz embedding problems (and related issues) and the structure of boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic spaces. The projects in geometric group theory are a continuation of my earlier work, which is influenced by Gromov's papers ""Hyperbolic groups"" and ""Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups"", rigidity theory,  3-manifolds, and geometric mapping/function theory;  their principal aim is to address rigidity and uniformization/geometrization problems for groups by analyzing their asymptotic structure with a variety of tools from geometry, analysis, topology, dynamics and combinatorics.<br/><br/><br/>The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation:<br/>evolution of surfaces by mean curvature, and Hamilton's Ricci flow.

Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible,  in order to reveal hidden symmetries,  and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist. <br/>This is very useful for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups, and is part of confluence of several research trends over the last 10-15 years.

Questions in low dimensional differential topology are central to much of current research in both geometry and topology.  Symplectic and gauge theoretic techniques provide powerful tools for studying such manifolds, but they are not known to be all powerful,  More is needed, especially in dimension four where ignorance is broad and deep.  Thus the focus here to develop new tools and sharpen the old ones.  The goal for the fifth project topic is to settle once and for all various conjectured equivalences between differential topology invariants of three and four dimensional manifolds.  The goal of the final topic is to make some rigorous quantum field theories of the sorts that are used by physicists to model elementary particle interactions, and of the sort used to define conformal and topological field theories.  The construction of mathematically rigorous versions of realistic quantum field theories is one of the key concerns of mathematical physics.<br/><br/>            Our universe requires three spatial coordinates to describe the position of any given event, and then a fourth parameter, which is the time of the event.  A space that requires four coordinates to describe is said to have four dimensions.  Any such space looks rather boring, and much like any other at small scales, but the large scale structure can be very complicated.  The surface of the earth provides a 2-dimensional example. Any given place requires 2 parameters to specify (longitude and latitude).  At small scales (those visible to us pedestrians), any one place looks relatively flat (modulo a hill or two) and much like any other.  However, the surface of the earth at large scales is curved as it is, after all, a sphere.  A fundamental question is to determine the large scale 4-dimensional shape of our universe.  Any such determination will ultimately come from Astronomy.  Even so, it is a mathematical problem to determine a reasonable list of the possible 4-dimensional shapes.  Most of this research project is directed towards developing the mathematical tools that will allow us to determine such a list.  As it turns out, lists are known for the spaces of dimension less than 4, and tools are available that give appropriate lists for spaces of dimension greater than 4.  Dimension 4 seems the toughest nut to crack.  A secondary focus of this research is to investigate certain model equations that physicists use to predict the behavior of matter and energy at sub-atomic length scales.  These equations are examples of quantum field theories.  Realistic quantum field theories are very complicated and so calculations are often impossible to do.  The models studied here may suggest improved calculational techniques.<br/><br/>"

This role has only been amplified in the last few decades since spaces with non-negative or positive curvature arise naturally in quite general contexts, including limit processes.  In this generality, positively curved spaces  (up to scaling) play exactly the same role as unit spheres do to smooth Riemannian manifolds. Our understanding of low dimensional non-negatively curved spaces also played a pivotal role in the recent solution of the famous Poincare and geometrization conjectures. In higher dimensions relatively little is known in general about manifolds or spaces with non-negative or positive curvature. Also only a few constructions and a modest number of examples are known. Motivated by the fact that all known examples come from group constructions and have fairly large groups of symmetries, one of the primary aims of this proposal is to expand our understanding of manifolds with positive or non-negative curvature by describing or possibly even classifying those with large symmetry groups. This program which combines geometry, topology and representation theory has already gained considerable momentum, and has resulted in several classification results as well as in the construction of many new manifolds with non-negative curvature, and new promising candidates for positive curvature.<br/><br/><br/>The sphere, the Euclidean space, and the hyperbolic space are exactly the (simply connected) spaces characterized by having constant curvature and also by having maximal symmetry group. Spaces being more curved than these spaces are characterized geometrically by the property that geodesic triangles (triangles with shortest side lengths) are ""fatter"" than in the constant curvature space. For example a space has non-negative curvature if geodesic triangles in the space are ""fatter"" than in the Euclidean plane (where the sum of angles is 180 degrees). Such spaces play a fundamental role in geometry and form an extension of classical Riemannian geometry, which deals with smooth and regular spaces of this type. The ones of positive, non-negative curvature, or even ""almost non- negative"" curvature play a particular role and their investigations are essential to all of them. As in many part of physics our purpose in this proposal is to analyze and ultimately describe positively curved spaces and non-negatively curved spaces where large groups of symmetries are present (as is the case for the classical constant curvature model spaces above). These investigations will also provide ""models"" for analyzing ""almost non-positively curved spaces"" and thereby give new insights to the structure of all spaces with a lower curvature bound and possibly yield general long sought after restrictions on manifolds with non-negative curvature via limit processes.<br/><br/><br/>"

Examples of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds include quotients of hyperbolic space by certain groups of motion. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild model of the exterior of a black hole can  be viewed as an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with two ends, while the Schwarzschild model of the exterior of a black hole can be viewed as a manifold with two ends that is asymptotically hyperbolic on one end and asymptotically Euclidean on the other. The principal investigator will study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the wave equation on nontrapping asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and the Schwarzschild model of a black hole. In both cases the long-time behavior of waves is associated with the distribution of resonances, or scattering poles, and the project will address this question as well. The principal investigator will also study inverse scattering, including the question of determining an asymptotically Euclidean manifold from the scattering matrices at all energies. This requires the proof of a support theorem that generalizes to this setting the well-known support theorem for the Radon transform in Euclidean space.<br/><br/>One central problem in the study of partial differential equations is to understand how geometric properties of a medium influence the way waves propagate on it. The principal investigator will study the long time-behavior of solutions to the wave equation on spaces that are motivated by examples from physics. The ""inverse problem"" consists of using measurements obtained from waves that propagate on a certain medium to determine some of the medium's geometric properties. For example, by knocking on the surface of an object and listening to how it responds to this signal, one can obtain information about the object's interior; by measuring the time a wave travels between two points on the surface of the object one would like to obtain information about the variable speed of propagation of the waves in the interior of the object. The principal investigator will study problems of this nature in the spaces indicated above. The techniques that need to be developed might also have applications in other areas, such as tomography."

This proposal builds on joint work by the PI and Petersen,  who have proven a number of classification theorems for gradient Ricci solitons, or self-similar solutions to the flow.  An important tool in this work is  the theory of curvature dimension inequalities developed by Bakry and Emery and their collaborators, which was also researched by the PI in<br/>joint work with Wei.   One aspect of this project is to investigate<br/>new theorems relating  Ricci solitons and curvature dimension inequalities.

As an example, the PI will investigate the<br/>interesting relationship between curvature dimension inequalities and warped product Einstein manifolds.<br/><br/>Global Riemannian geometry studies the relationship between the infinitesimal warping (or curvature) of a space, and the global shape of that space.  These spaces, or manifolds, appear frequently in science and engineering problems because physical laws can generally be modeled by partial differential equations on a manifold.  Partial differential equations are also important in geometry because they are used to draw global conclusions from curvature, which is a type of local information. This structure on the overall shape in turn allows new insights into the behavior of differential equations on the<br/>manifold.   The Ricci flow, which is one of the most important partial<br/>differential equations in mathematics, has been used to classify the shape of all three dimensional manifolds.  A better understanding of singularities in the Ricci flow  promises deep new discoveries applicable to many areas of mathematics and science.  Because this project advances our understanding of the geometry of manifolds, it will also contribute to a better understanding of many physical models."

The first step is to prove some analytic results on the Taubesian gluing maps which model the ends of the moduli space of SO(3) monopoles.  These results will complete the proof of the SO(3) monopole cobordism formula, giving a relation between the Seiberg-Witten and the Donaldson invariants and a relation between the Seiberg-Witten and the spin invariants.  These relations resemble Witten's conjecture relating the Seiberg-Witten and the Donaldson invariants except that they contain some unknown coefficients depending only on the topological type of the underlying four-manifold.  The second step is an extension of Taubes' work on the gluing maps for the moduli space of anti-self-dual connections to prove that the bubbletree compactification of the moduli space of anti-self-dual connections is a manifold with boundary.  This result will provide a framework to prove a relation between the Donaldson and spin invariants.  It is hoped that combining the three relations will yield new topological constraints on these gauge theoretic invariants.  Finally, the analytic work on the SO(3) monopole invariants should answer the question of whether it is possible to define gauge-theoretic invariants for four-manifolds with b^+ even by using the moduli space of SO(3) monopoles.<br/><br/><br/>Manifolds are shapes which locally resemble the Euclidean space of our everyday experience. The solution set of n equations in (n+d) variables will usually be a d-dimensional manifold: thus manifolds appear throughout mathematics and its applications, from the knot theory used to describe DNA to the manifolds appearing in string theory. Two manifolds are diffeomorphic if one can be stretched, without wrinkling, into the other.  Deciding when four-dimensional manifolds are diffeomorphic has proven to be a particularly difficult problem.  An invariant is a rule assigning an algebraic object such as a number or polynomial to a topological space in such a manner that the algebraic object does not change when the space is stretched.  Hence if I is an invariant and X and Y are topological spaces with I(X) not equal to I(Y) then X cannot be stretched into Y so X and Y are not diffeomorphic.  <br/>The goal of this project is to look for relations between different invariants and to find new invariants.<br/>"

The first specific class of projects involves continuing work with T. Riviere, on relations between the pth power  <br/>energy of a map between Riemannian manifolds and its homotopy class.   <br/>In various higher dimensional cases, energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings  to a manifold may produce new geometric topologically nontrivial objects and is related to the nonvanishing homotopy of the manifold. This concentration behavior corresponding to any nontorsion homotopy invariant can now be described, and bubbling related to torsion invariants is being investigated for  <br/>variational problems.   We also are attacking higher order Sobolev  <br/>spaces which seem more natural for certain homotopy classes, but for which basic approximation results and constructions have not been  <br/>previously studied.  Work with Thierry De Pauw involves the study of   <br/>chains, cochains, charges, and the higher dimensional calculus of  <br/>variations in general metric spaces with general coefficient groups.   <br/>We consider a variety of mass-type functionals and the notion of a flat chain which generalizes the finite mass metric-space currents of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and the rectifiable and flat Euclidean-space G- chains of B.White. Semi-algebraic maps, chains, forms, and various structures generalized from geometric measure theory continue proving useful in work with Pascal Lambrechts on the topology of algebraic varieties, including the real homotopy theory. Also metric properties of varieties are  to be approached using special classes of metric chains and cochains.  Other studies include microstructure computation, combined transport-shape problems with applications to imaging, and the existence and regularity of optimal trusses.<br/><br/>Solutions to many variational problems in both pure and applied mathematics often are forced to have singularities, that is, to involve regions where large oscillations occur.  For example a nematic liquid crystal material in a spherical container whose optical axis is forced to point outward on the container necessarily will have singularities inside (observable through cross-polarizers or x-ray diffraction).  In this example the optical axis has an energy density, which measures its local rate of change and whose integral tends to have a minimum value among all possible configurations. Our research proposes to understand the relationship between energies in such variational problems and the topological barriers imposed by the physics of these problems.  We have derived new notions which allow the treatment and precise geometric and analytic description of a wide variety of problems from soap films (which locally minimize area) and their higher dimensional  <br/>generalizations to optimal transport paths in various complex media.   <br/>The goal in these applications of geometric calculus of variations is to develop sufficient mathematical tools to model, compute, and predict physical behavior.  Geometric constraints which occur naturally in many physical problems have led to new mathematical and computational issues.  In particular, three that we are now studying involve flow problems in image processing,  microstructure formation in certain crystalline materials, and geometric analysis of large data sets.<br/><br/>"

In particular, the Principal Investigator will further develop a Floer homology theory for knots, arising from instantons with codimension-2 singularities, and will investigate its relationship to Khovanov homology. A spectral sequence will be established relating the two homology theories.  He will investigate whether one can prove the non-triviality of the Floer theory arising from singular instantons, with a view towards showing that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.  The instanton homology theory of sutured manifolds, recently developed by the PI and Mrowka, will be further explored. It will be proved that the resulting Floer homology of links recovers the multi-variable Alexander polynomial. In a similar spirit, the instanton homology of closed 3-manifolds will be shown to recover the Reidemeister torsion.  The PI will define invariants of transverse<br/>links: links transverse to the standard contact structure in the three-sphere or other 3-manifolds. These invariants will reside in the link Floer homology groups arising from the instanton theory on sutured manifolds.<br/><br/>Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness.  Its importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by the French mathematician Poincare, during his investigation of the laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to Newton's laws.  In the past twenty years, topology has seen applications in questions such as the knotting of proteins and DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The topology of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher dimension, is of particular subtlety.  In recent years, a wealth of new techniques have been introduced to study the phenomena that arise in dimension three. This project will further develop these new techniques, and will explore the mysterious relationships between them. In so doing, the project will deepen our understanding of topology and its interaction with other areas of mathematics and science. At the same time, the project will train graduate students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.<br/>"

Asymptotic geometric analysis deals with geometric properties of finite dimensional convex bodies as the dimension grows to infinity. In her research the PI uses methods from both areas, as well as probabilistic tools and concentration  phenomena, to get a better understanding of the structure of convex sets. The  PI was able to prove a variety of results where such structural aspects of convex sets play a role: in approximation of convex bodies by polytopes; to establish a link between the so called order statistics (which are fundamental objects in statistics)  and Orlicz norms; to determine the ``sizes"" of certain (convex) sets that appear naturally in quantum information theory.<br/>A further focus  of the PI's research is the development of affine invariants.  <br/>The PI and her collaborators started the  systematic study of (affine invariant) functionals associated with convex bodies and their corresponding inequalities. Among the most important such functionals are  affine surface area and p-affine surface area . The affine isoperimetric inequalities related to them are more powerful than their Euclidean relatives and related to  other important inequalities, e.g. <br/>the  Santalo- and Inverse Santalo- inequalities. The latter is related to Mahler's conjecture which is still open in dimension 3 and higher.<br/><br/>A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases which are not visible in low dimensions. <br/>We can  exploit those patters, thus taking advantage of the ""curse of dimensionality"" to make it the  ""blessing of dimensionality"". <br/>It is one purpose of this grant to study such high dimensional phenomena.<br/>"

On one hand, the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture has led to work by Kontsevich, Soibelman, Gross, Siebert, Zharkov and others to view mirror symmetry in terms of integral affine manifolds and tropical data on them. On the other hand, Mikhalkin's pioneering work on holomorphic curve counting using tropical geometry demonstrated that Gromov-Witten invariants were accessible by tropical methods, and increasingly, tropical methods are being seen as a tool for studying algebraic varieties. The aim of this FRG is to make further connections between tropical geometry and mirror symmetry with the aim of creating a new synthesis of these two fields. Some of the research directions of this project include the study of mirror symmetry for Fanos and manifolds of general type;  Lagrangians and SYZ fibrations in this new setting; non-archimedean integrable systems in hyper-Kaehler manifolds; tropical enumerative geometry of real and complex curves; the development of non-commutative Hodge theory, tropical homology and its relation to classical homology and the Hodge conjecture; Welschinger invariants, open Gromov-Witten theory and their applications to mirror symmetry. These should greatly extend the realm of mirror symmetry and applications of tropical geometry to the classical algebro-geometric world. Members of this FRG include: Ricardo Castano-Bernard (Kansas State), Mark Gross (San Diego),  Ilia Itenberg (Strasbourg), Ludmil Katzarkov (Miami), Viatcheslav Kharlamov (Strasbourg); Maxim Kontsevich  (I.H.E.S & Miami),  Diego Matessi (Alessandria); Grigory Mikhalkin (Geneva), Yan Soibelman (Kansas State), Jake Solomon (Hebrew U),  Ilia Zharkov (Kansas State).<br/><br/>During past 25 years there has been intensive interaction between string theory and geometry which has led to a creation of entirely new mathematical areas. String theory also suggested that ""conventional""<br/>geometry emerges from the quantum theory at certain limits. Then various ""string dualities"" give equivalent but mathematically very different descriptions of the same physical quantities. A beautiful and deep example illustrating all these ideas is mirror symmetry. An important component of this project is to expand the existing collaborative links of the FRG members exploring tropical methods of mirror symmetry into a solid collaborative network of postdocs, graduate students and experts in an integrated research-training environment. This includes the organization of workshops, summer schools and local seminar series at the local FRG nodes. International exchange of young and senior researchers is one of the key aspects of this project bringing together well-established groups in Europe and in the U.S. The participation of mathematicians and young researchers from underrepresented groups will be promoted."

One of the best known areas of global harmonic analysis is Quantum Chaos, which concerns the impact of ergodicity or mixing of the geodesic flow on semi-classical limits of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.  Nalini Anantharaman and I are continuing our joint work in quantum ergodicity on hyperbolic surfaces, where we are constructing an explicit intertwining operator between classical and quantum dynamics. Using the hyperbolic Poisson operator, I reduced the study of quantum limits to the ideal boundary and am studying boundary distributions of eigenfunctions. Dynamics also can be used in inverse spectral theory. Hamid Hezari and I have recently proved that any analytic domain with mirror symmetries across all axes are determined by their Dirichlet spectra. We are currently relating our results to Birkhoff normal forms. John Toth, Hans Christianson and I are also developing a new area of quantum ergodic restriction theorems, where eigenfunctions are ergodic after being restricted to hypersurfaces.   In another direction, global harmonic analysis is useful in constructing approximate solutions of the complex homogeneous Monge Ampere equations governing geodesics in the space of Kahler metrics. Rubinstein and I are using complex Fourier integral operator methods to solve the Cauchy initial value problem for geodesics.  With Shiffman and Zeitouni I am continuing also my work on random holomorphic fields on Kahler manifolds. This is another kind of asymptotic geometry where the number of zeros tends to infinity. <br/><br/><br/>Global harmonic analysis and asymptotic geometry is  the use of ideas and techniques of quantum mechanics to solve problems in geometry, analysis and mathematical physics. A famous problem is to whether one can hear the shape of a drum, i.e. tell the shape from the frequencies of vibration. One would also like to know the shapes and sizes of the modes of vibration, and the structure of the nodal sets where the drum is not moving as it vibrates. For two hundred years,  the frequencies and shapes of modes of vibration have been important in physics and engineering, both for actual drums and also for atoms and molecules. It turns out that one can learn a lot about modes of vibration by playing billiards on the drum head. By looking carefully at waves moving along bouncing ball orbits (billiard trajectories which hit the domain orthogonally at two points and endlessly bounce back and forth between these points), one can determine the entire shape of an analytic drum. Morever, when the billiards are chaotic then one can determine the patterns of nodal sets, where the drum is still as it vibrates.  My research gives rigorous proofs of these statements. <br/><br/><br/>"

More precisely, the proposer would like to understand the structure of possible singular limiting metrics one gets. Since the ancient solutions occur as singularity models of finite time singularities, the proposer suggests to study the properties and the classification of those in the case of different flows. One special case of ancient solutions are the gradient shrinking solitons. There is much to be understood about their geometric properties especially in the complete higher dimensional  cases which can help the classification of those. Related to the singularities I the proposer also suggests studying the optimal conditions under which one can guarantee the existence of a smooth solution to e.g. the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow.<br/><br/><br/>The proposer is interested in studying different parabolic geometric flows since their parabolic properties tend to improve the properties of the initial geometric objects. For example, under certain conditions on the initial metric the Ricci flow tends to exist forever and converges to a metric of constant sectional curvature which tells us a lot about the topology of our manifold. That means one can sometimes use the parabolic geometric flows in order to resolve some issues in other mathematical fields. Ancient solutions are the solutions that come from all the way from negative infinity. The physicists are interested in understanding those solutions to the Ricci flow.  <br/><br/><br/>"

In this proposal we consider questions which deal with the relations between these different areas of low complexity dynamics. If we consider a billiard trajectory and keep track of the sides that it hits we can interpret the result as a symbolic system. We investigate symbolic systems that arise this way. The study of such systems gives us a common ground in which symbolic techniques and polygonal billiard techniques can both be applied. The collection of translation surfaces of a fixed topological type forms a topological space which we think of as a moduli space. This space has a natural unipotent flow on it which is usually called the horocycle flow. We consider to what extent does this flow behave like the unipotent flows described by Ratner's classification theorem. In particular we consider the extent to which techniques that work in the homogeneous case do and do not work in the moduli space case.<br/><br/><br/>In physics, biology, economics and many other fields one studies the long term behavior of mathematical models of systems that change with time. If these systems are deterministic and autonomous, that is to say isolated from their environment, then they fall in the domain of the field of dynamical systems. A fundamental discovery of this field is that there are common elements of behavior for systems that arise in different areas. There are for example common features to ""chaotic"" systems. In this proposal we study a class of systems which  we call low complexity by contrast with typical dynamical systems which are ""chaotic"" or ""high complexity"". This proposal deals with three families of low complexity dynamical systems and the relations between them."
