On compact manifolds, one of the fundamental questions is: To what extent is the geometry of Riemannian manifolds encoded in the spectra of their Laplacians? This is a very extensively investigated question in the literature. The PI is one of the initiators of spectral investigations developed on manifolds having different local geometries. Among the isospectrality examples the PI constructed the most surprising are the isospectrality families containing both homogeneous and locally inhomogeneous metrics. Although this field became very developed in the past 15 years, it is far from being a closed area. All the constructions performed so far deal with the function-spectra and nothing is known about the form-spectra. For instance,  no metrics with different local geometries are known, upto this day, whichare isospectral also on forms. The extension of the isospectrality investigations to the forms and the ultimate solution of this long standing problem of finding p-isospectral compact manifolds with different local geometries belong to the main objectives of this proposal. This goal is aimed by the new explicit intertwining operator found by the PI just recently. This new technique opens up the possibility also for explicit spectrum computations, both on functions and forms. Spectral analysis on open manifols is a developing area of mathematics. Because of the infinite trace of the fundamental kernels (such as the heat-or Schroedinger-kernel) on the open manifolds, all the methods and tools applied on compact manifolds break down in the non-compact cases. The only tool by which these infinities are handled today is the so called ""regularization"" by which the desired finite quantities are produced by differences of infinities. This perturbative tool has been borrowed from quantum theory (""renormalization""), where the above infinities appear as infinite self mass or self charge of particles. Just recently, the PI has a new non-pertubative tool found by which these infinities can be handled on a rather wide range of Riemannian manifolds, called Zeeman manifolds. By the explicit spectrum computation, developed in isospectrality constructions, the Hilbert space of functions on a Zeeman manifold decomposes into subspaces (zones) which are invariant under the actions of the Laplacian and the natural Heisenberg group representation. Therefore, this operator can be investigated on each zone separately, meaning that important objects such as the heat flow, Schroedinger flow, partition- and zeta-function, e. t. c. can be introduced on each zone separately. In other words, a well defined zonal geometry (de Broglie geometry) can be developed, where the most surprising result is that quantities divergent on the global setting are finite on the zonal setting. Even the zonal Feynman integral is well defined. Since the Laplacian on Zeeman manifolds is nothing but the Zeeman-Hamilton operators of free charged particles, these investigations are most relevant to the quantum physics.<br/><br/>The main focus of this proposal will be some of the fundamental questions of spectral theory on Riemannian manifolds. On compact manifolds this field might as well be called audible versus nonaudible geometry, which designation readily suggests the fundamental question of the area: To what extend is the geometry encoded into the eigenvalues of the Laplacian (spectrum) of a Riemannian manifold? A wide range of examples show that the spectrum bears just little information about the geometry. Yet, until the early 90's, a general expectation was that the spectrum does determine the local geometry. The PI was one of the first ones who disproved this conjecture and initiated spectral investigations on manifolds having different local geometries. Among the examples the PI constructed the most interesting are the isospectral metrics such that one of them is homogeneous (having a huge group of isometries acting transitively on the manifold) while the other is locally inhomogeneous (having just a ""thin"" group of local isometries which do not act transitively on the manifold). These examples show that one of the most important geometric data, the group of isometries, is not spectrally determined. Though this field developed very rapidly in the past 15 years, this theory has not been extended to the forms yet. This extension of the theory, including also the solution of the long standing difficult problem of finding locally non-isometric yet p-isospectral metrics, is one of the main objectives of this proposal. Spectral theory on non-compact manifolds is struggling with the infinities appearing in calculating the trace of natural kernels such as the heat kernel. Due to these infinities, all those methods break down on non-compact manifolds which are perfectly working in the compact case. This problem of infinities is parallel to the problem of infinities appearing in quantum theory. In both cases the problem is handled by a perturbative device (regularization resp. renormalization), producing the desired finite quantities by differences of infinities. As a second subject, this proposal introduces a new, natural, non-perturbative device which produces the desired finite quantities on non-compact manifolds directly. This tool is relevant also to quantum theory.<br/><br/>"

The conference has  become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The  next series of conferences will have six primary sponsoring  universities: The University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University,  Rice University, the University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and  Texas Christian University.  The conference is designed to enhance both  the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of  geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states.  The  conference is committed to bring researchers of national and  international stature to discuss their research and to interact with  mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states.  Summaries of talks  with notation of important results have been publicly reported for some  time and will continue similarly in the future.<br/><br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two  high-impact foci.  First, the conference makes it possible for the  community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states  (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular  basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates productive  cooperative efforts between schools.  Second, the conference is  committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.  In order that there be no barrier to participation, the  conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no  registration fees.  Graduate students, junior faculty, women,  minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.

The ``Lagrangian Hodge Conjecture'' states that given an<br/>integral lagrangian homology class in a Calabi-Yau manifold there is a special<br/>lagrangian cycle that represents this class. This conjecture is now known to<br/>be false in a Calabi-Yau surface (a K3 surface). The failure of the conjecture<br/>is closely related to the existence of singularities (other than branch<br/>points) on minimizing lagrangians.  This project aims to answer a related<br/>conjecture, the ``Deformation Lagrangian Hodge Conjecture'': Given a<br/>one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau metrics whose associated Kaehler forms have<br/>fixed cohomology class and given a lagrangian homology class, suppose that the<br/>initial metric in the family admits a special lagrangian cycle that represents<br/>the lagrangian homology class. Then, we conjecture, that the metrics in the<br/>one-parameter family sufficient close to the initial metric also admit special<br/>lagrangian cycles that represents this class. This conjecture has been<br/>established in the two dimension case (the case of special lagrangian surfaces<br/>in K3 surfaces) and in the case that the initial special lagrangian is an<br/>immersion. It is known that the mean curvature flow of a smooth lagrangian<br/>submanifold preserves the lagrangian condition if the ambient manifold is<br/>Kaehler-Einstein. The project intends to investigate various questions about<br/>the behavior of lagrangians under this flow, in particular, to study examples<br/>that can be used either to give counter-examples to the Thomas-Yau conjecture<br/>or show that any such counter-example must be global.<br/><br/>Variational problems with geometric constraints, deformation problems and mean<br/>curvature flow in codimension greater than one are on the frontier of<br/>mathematical analysis. These problems are natural in geometry but they are<br/>also important in many different applied problems. For example, in material<br/>science a model problem asks to find a minimizer of ``kinetic energy'' among<br/>area preserving maps between disks and to find the optimal smoothness of the<br/>minimizer.  Parts of this project are closely related to this kind of<br/>existence and regularity question and therefore to developing techniques at<br/>the foundations of the theory of non-linear elasticity. In string theory, a<br/>branch of theoretical physics, well known work conjectures the existence of a<br/>certain class of volume minimizing three dimensional surfaces called special<br/>lagrangian submanifolds. This project is a direct attempt to resolve this<br/>conjecture.  Mean curvature flow in various codimensions models many different<br/>physical phenomena, including, for example, flame propagation. This project<br/>attempts to exploit the ``lagrangian'' constraint to get an understanding of<br/>mean curvature flow in higher codimensions. The techniques investigated in<br/>this project hold the promise of enhancing the interaction between geometry<br/>and various fields of applied mathematics and engineering and in bringing new<br/>results and techniques into these fields.<br/>"

In this proposal, the IP plans to study the large scale geometry of  S-arithmetic groups and to prove the integral Novikov conjecture in surgery theory and K-theory for them. Since many natural S-arithmetic groups such as SL(n, Z[1/p]) contain  nontrivial torsion elements, this proposal emphasizes a generalized integral  Novikov conjecture. S-arithemtic groups act naturally on products of symmetric  spaces and Bruhat-Tits buildings. The PI also proposes to study compactifications of Bruhat-Tits buildings.

In the last 15 years there have been several new perspectives on moduli spaces that have not only increased our understanding of these important objects, but have fundamentally affected major research directions of several areas of topology and geometry, including Hyperbolic Geometry and Geometric Group Theory, Algebraic and Symplectic Geometry, and most recently, Algebraic Topology. In the last five years there have been several startling advances in several of these areas. Taken as a whole, these areas have, in the last few years, represented some of the most exciting directions of study in topology and geometry, and they promise to continue to do so in the forseeable future. This proposal is for the funding of a major, three year emphasis program in the topology and geometry of moduli spaces and related topics. Each year a different mathematical perspective of this topic will be emphasized, but all three years will involve participants from a broad range of subfields. The three areas of emphasis will be Hyperbolic Geometry and Geometric Group Theory, The Algebraic Topology of Moduli Spaces and String Topology, and The Algebraic Geometry of Moduli Spaces and Symplectic Geometry.<br/><br/>The study of surfaces has been a major driving force in mathematics since the time of Riemann in the mid 19th century. The space of geometric structures on a given two dimensional surface is known as the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. These moduli spaces have been classically studied in algebraic geometry. With the pioneering work of M. Gromov in the 1970's,  these moduli spaces became instrumental in the study of symplectic geometry as well. They are also central  in the modern view of low dimensional topology and hyperbolic geometry  initiated by Thurston around the same time. With the development of conformal field theory and string theory in the 1980's, these moduli spaces also began to play an important role in theoretical physics. Most recently, techniques of algebraic topology have been brought to bear on the study of these moduli spaces over the last few years with exciting results. Conversely, formalisms from physics and geometry have had a major impact on recent research directions in algebraic topology. The last five years have seen exciting developments in all these geometric and topological areas affecting and affected by moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. As one can imagine, the excitement produced in these areas of study have attracted many graduate students and young mathematicians. To be effective researchers, it is important that these young mathematicians gain an understanding of the various different perspectives on these moduli spaces and related objects. Cross pollination between these areas both in terms of techniques and directions of research, can have a powerful effect on the development of these central topics in topology and geometry. This proposal is for the funding of a major, three year emphasis program in the topology and geometry of moduli spaces and related topics. The program will be organized by the Mathematics Research Center of Stanford University, one of the leading centers of research in geometry and topology, and by the American Institute of Mathematics, which is a major independent research institute. Each year a different mathematical perspective of this topic will be emphasized, but all three years will involve participants from a broad range of subfields. Some of the world's leading senior mathematicians, their junior colleagues, as well as students will participate in these programs, share and compare their different perspectives and areas of expertise, and will  work together  to deepen our understanding of this central area of mathematics, and produce new and exciting methods, techniques, and results.  <br/>"

A least area plane is a plane where any subdisk is area minimizing among the disks with same boundary. For a given simple closed curve in sphere at infinity, the existence of a least area plane that spans the given curve in hyperbolic 3-space is known by Anderson's results. However,  there are few results on the number of such least area planes so far. In particular there is no known example of a simple closed curve at infinity bounding two different least area planes. The investigator obtained strong generic uniqueness results on the problem by combining the results from very different fields, like global analysis, minimal surfaces, and elliptic PDEs. In this project, he will investigate whether the uniqueness is true in general, and he will try to prove the rigidity of least area planes in hyperbolic 3-space. Such a result will be a crucial ingredient for solving some problems in the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, Teichmuller theory, and hyperbolic geometry. The second goal of the project is to investigate same problem for the absolutely area minimizing hypersurfaces in hyperbolic n-space. This problem is also known as the number of solutions to the asymptotic Plateau problem. Another part of this project is to approach the ""Universal Cover Conjecture"" by using minimal surface techniques. Universal Cover Conjecture states that the universal cover of any irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is an open  3-ball. Gabai suggested a program to solve this conjecture by using minimal surfaces. He showed that if the universal cover of the 3-manifold has a properly embedded least area plane, then it is homeomorphic to an open 3-ball. The author aims to fill the missing part of the proof by constructing a properly embedded least area plane in a universal cover of an irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group.<br/><br/>The author will undertake research in Differential Geometry, Geometrical Analysis,and Geometric Topology. He will investigate the asymptotic Plateau problem by using topological techniques. The problem attracted many mathematicians for more than 20 years. The results of this problem have produced fruitful applications in the solutions of some classical low dimensional topology problems. The rigidity result which the author is trying to prove will have many applications in low dimensional topology, Teichmuller theory, and hyperbolic geometry which are all traditional areas of investigations that  have experienced a tremendous progress in the last 20 years. The second part of the project is to attack a long standing low dimensional topology problem, ""The Universal Cover Conjecture"", by using minimal surface techniques. This conjecture is one of the most famous conjectures in 3-manifold topology, and it is interesting in own right. It has attracted many topology for more than 50 years. Minimal surfaces had many fruitful applications to several important problems in low dimensional topology, and the investigator is trying to apply the useful properties of these objects to prove this classical conjecture."

Kumar and J. Millson propose to attack for a general reductive group G the problems previously solved for the groups of invertible unitary n by n matrices. The history of Lie theory has shown that it is of critical importance to understand in the context of general Lie groups results proved initially for the group of invertible n by n matrices.<br/><br/>A large part of mathematics and physics has been involved with the study of eigenvalues, for example determining the modes of vibration of a violin string or the energy levels of an atom amounts to finding eigenvalues of a Hermitian linear operator. A fundamental problem is to determine the possibilities for the eigenvalues of the sum of two operators given the eigenvalues of each one. Another fundamental problem with its roots in physics is the problem of studying the representations of an abstract group as a group of matrices. This problem in turn has been organized into subproblems. One of the most important of these is the problem of decomposing (tensor) products of representations as sums of representations. The point of this proposal is that these two basic problems, the eigenvalue of the sum problem and the decomposing (tensor) products problem are very closely related. The authors propose to pin down this relationship (already well-understood for special cases) for the general case. This FRG grant will play a fundamental role in the further development of a national group of scientists working on the area common to Lie theory, topology, algebraic and symplectic geometry, combinatorics and the theory of buildings. A class of young mathematicians especially graduate students and postdocs in the mid-Atlantic area (including Washington and Chapel Hill) and the greater (San Francisco) bay area (including Davis) will have the opportunity to learn about and work on exciting and fundamental problems through the Meetings and Workshops envisaged by the PIs. This class already includes the nine graduate students presently advised by the PIs. We expect to include other graduate students and postdocs associated to the very strong programs in representation theory and geometry at the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California at Davis. We also expect that graduate students, postdocs and faculty from neighboring universities such as Johns Hopkins, Duke, North Carolina State University, UC-Berkeley and Stanford will participate in and profit from the FRG grant.

Five faculty members (Mario Bonk, Richard Canary, John<br/>Erik Fornaess, Juha Heinonen and Ralf Spatzier) will lead this<br/>project in collaboration with eleven other senior faculty.  The<br/>proposal calls for several specific innovations in the training<br/>program by: providing intensive exploratory seminars and<br/>workshops, travel semesters to deepen the scientific training at<br/>other insitutions at the forefront of research, opportunities to<br/>develop lecturing skills, intensive mentoring and exposure to<br/>research in the three areas to undergraduates.<br/><br/>Geometry, topology and dynamical systems are core areas of<br/>mathematics.

The first is to study measured  metric spaces with nonnegative Ricci curvature in a general sense. Many of the known  results about Ricci curvature for smooth spaces have extensions to nonsmooth spaces.  However, there are also many results known for smooth  spaces, for which the nonsmooth extension is unclear. The proposed research will  explore the extent to which the curvature properties of nonsmooth spaces resemble those of smooth spaces. The second main topic is Ricci flow.  The Ricci flow, introduced by R. Hamilton in the 1980's, is a way to evolve the  ""shape"" of a space by means of its Ricci curvature.  Recently, Perelman has made  spectacular use of the Ricci flow to address the most important problems in three-dimensional topology.  The long-time behavior of the Ricci flow is largely unknown and will be addressed in the proposal. In addition, the extension of Perelman's results to three-dimensional orbifolds will be considered.<br/><br/>Overall, the proposal is concerned with the idea of curvature.  Historically, curvature was first considered for curves in the plane, and then for  curves and surfaces in three-dimensional space.  Riemann showed how to make sense of the curvature of a smooth space of arbitrary dimension. In  fact, there are various notions of curvature - the sectional curvature defined by  Riemann and the Ricci curvature, which is an averaging of the sectional  curvature.The Einstein equation of general relativity is phrased in terms of Ricci curvature. Ever since Riemann's time, there has been interest in making sense of the curvature of nonsmooth spaces.  Alexandrov gave a good notion of what it means for a nonsmooth space to have nonnegative sectional curvature.  Recent work, in collaboration with Cedric Villani, has  given a good notion of what it means for a nonsmooth space to have nonnegative Ricci curvature.  The definition is in terms of  ""optimal transport"", a subject which has a history in applied mathematics.  Part of the research in the proposal uses ""optimal transport"" to  study the geometry of nonsmooth spaces.  Going the other way, ideas from  geometry will be used to address issues in ""optimal transport"".<br/>"

These include investigating ring structures on twisted K-theory groups,   studying the relation between the twisted K^0-group and the Grothendieck group of twisted vector bundles over groupoids,  developing twisted equivariant cohomology and studying its relation with twisted equivariant $K$-theory groups under the Chern-Connes character map. The project also aims at the quantization of Lie bialgebroids and quasi-Poisson groupoids.<br/><br/>Groupoids are useful tools  in studying  the  symmetry of various geometric problems. They also appear naturally in foliation theory as well as in  modern Poisson geometry. Groupoid C^*-algebras, on the other hand, have been studied for more than two decades by operator algebraists, and they play an important role in noncommutative differential geometry. Indeed noncommutative geometry is the study of geometry through operator algebras, which has  applications to many areas of mathematics including analysis, topology and geometry,  mathematical physics and number theory. A stack, roughly speaking, is a Morita equivalence class of groupoids. (Lie) groupoids relate to (differentiable) stacks like open covers relate to manifolds. Just like there are many ways to describe the same manifold by open covers and gluing data, there are many groupoids describing the same stack. The equivalence relation defined on groupoids is the Morita equivalence. The project, which is centered around the application of Lie groupoids, is to investigate questions motivated from mathematical physics, in particular string theory, by a combination of ideas from algebraic geometry, noncommutative geometry, operator algebras and KK-theory, and Poisson geometry. Thus it promotes further interaction between these fields.<br/><br/><br/>"

P. Serre had shown that for any two points on a closed Riemannian manifold there exist infinitely many geodesic segments joining them.  While it is a trivial statement that the length of a shortest geodesic segment joining any two points  equals to at most the diameter of a manifold, the investigator proposes to study the lengths of the other geodesic segments.  For example, it would be interesting to find out whether there always exist n distinct geodesic segments of length at most n times the diameter of a closed manifold.<br/><br/>Riemannian geometry is a generalization of geometry of surfaces to higher dimensions.  Some of the central objects of study of Riemannian geometry are geodesics, geodesic nets, minimal surfaces and other minimal objects. Geodesics generalize the notion of a straight line to Riemannian geometry.  The two essential properties of a line are: (1) that  it is straight; (2) that it minimizes distance between two points. We define geodesic as ""the straightest"" curve that lies on a  given Riemannian manifold.  It turns out that the distance between two points is minimized by a geodesic segment. However, the analogy between geodesic and line segments is not perfect.  For example, in the case of a closed Riemannian manifold there are infinitely many geodesic segments connecting any two points, as it was shown by J. P. Serre.  Also, some geodesics close on themselves and become  periodic. The investigator proposes to study the connection between the lengths of various geodesic segments connecting any two points on a closed Riemannian manifold and the size of this manifold represented by its volume and/or the diameter, defined as the maximal distance between two points.  The investigator also proposes to study the relationship between the length of a shortest closed geodesic on a manifold and the size of a manifold, as well as  relations between the size of a manifold and various other minimal objects.<br/><br/>"

The main focus of the project is to construct constant curvature metrics on triangulated closed 3-manifolds using a variational approach where the energy functional is the volume. Starting with a triangulation of a closed 3-manifold, the PI introduces the concept of angle structures on 3-simplexes and on triangulations. These are generalizations of the concepts introduced by  Casson and  Rivin  for  compact 3-manifold with non-empty tori boundary. An angle structure on a tetrahedron is an assignment of a dihedral angle to each edge of the tetrahedron so that each vertex triangle becomes a spherical triangle. For instance all spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic tetrahedra are angle structures. An angle structure on a triangulated closed 3-manifold is a realization of each 3-simplex by an angle structure so that the sum of dihedral angles at each edge is 360-degree. The space of all angle structures  on a fixed triangulated manifold is an open bounded convex polytope. The PI has shown that there is a natural notion of volume of angle structures which generalizes the notion of volume of tetrahedra in hyperbolic and spherical. The main focus of the project is on the local maximum point of the volume. The PI has established that the volume can be extended continuously to the compact closure of the space of all angle structures. This, in particular, established a conjecture of John Milnor on the volume of simplexes in classical geometry. It has also been shown that if the volume has a local maximum point in the space of all angle structures, then either the manifold has a constant curvature metric, or the manifold contains a very special 2-sphere or real projective plane. The main focus of the project is to study the maximum point of the volume at the boundary of the space of all angle structures.<br/><br/><br/>The physical universe is 3-dimensional. In mathematics,  3-dimensional spaces are called 3-manifolds. The study of 3-manifolds is one of the most important problems in geometry and topology. Understanding geometric shapes of the 3-dimensional spaces is of vital importance theoretically and practically. In 1978, William Thurston made a revolutionary conjecture which lists the best geometry structure a 3-dimensional space can have, i.e., he conjectured the best shape a 3-dimensional space can take. He also verified the conjecture for a vast class of 3-dimensional spaces. Recent work of R. Hamilton and G. Perelman may have solved conjecture.  However, for a 3-dimensional space, how to find algorithmically the best shape of a 3-dimensional space is still open. The goal of this proposal is to construct the algorithm. The PI has already made progresses in this direction. The successful completion of the proposal will have applications not only in mathematics, but also in computer graphics and computational general relativity.<br/>"

Since the year 2000, the site of the conference has rotated among the University of Georgia, the University of South  Carolina, and the College of Charleston, and has involved speakers and participants from a broad spectrum of types of institutions (public and private research universities, prominent regional  universities, and liberal arts colleges). Moreover, the organizers have actively sought to involve young  researchers and graduate students in the conference.  In particular, the SEGC provides a rare  venue for new and recent PhD recipients to give full-length presentations  (typically, 45-50 minutes in length) of their latest results.  In recent years, the SEGC has also included an evening  poster session for graduate students to present their dissertation research.

Tuschmann the PI plans to continue investingating the structure of the fundamental groups of nonnegatively and almost nonnegatively curved manifolds and also look for new topological obstructions to nonnegative  and almost nonnegative curvature for simply connected manifolds. The PI also plans to continue his work with B. Wilking on the fundamental groups of manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bounds. In particular we would like to show that the fundamental group of a manifold of almost nonnegative Ricci curvature contains a nilpotent subgroup of finite index with the bound on the index depending only on the dimension.The second part of the proposal (which is a joint project with A. Lytchak) deals with the notion of submetries which is a generalization of Riemannian submersion to singular spaces and its relation to collapsing under a lower curvature bound. The last part is the joint project with I.

One of the ways to measure how a space is curved is given by its  Ricci curvature. Understanding the influence of various  Ricci curvature bounds  on the global properties of a space is not only interesting in its own right but it's also important because Ricci curvature plays a fundamental  role in the Einstein general relativity theory.<br/>"

This subject is<br/>currently enjoying a period of intense interest and rapid progress,<br/>inspired by Perelman's landmark results in Hamilton's program to<br/>resolve the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures by Ricci flow. In<br/>applications of Ricci flow, one evolves a Riemannian metric on a<br/>manifold to simplify and improve its geometry. In many cases, these<br/>improvements involve changes in topology that are triggered by<br/>singularity formation. Such improvements are possible because<br/>solutions of Ricci flow (like many other nonlinear PDE) are expected<br/>to exhibit very special, highly symmetric profiles in a space-time<br/>neighborhood of a developing singularity. A thorough and deep<br/>understanding of singularity formation is therefore of critical<br/>importance for extracting topological and geometric information from<br/>Ricci flow behavior. The investigator's immediate objectives focus on<br/>singularity formation for curvature flows, particularly (1) analytic<br/>aspects (asymptotics) of singularity formation, (2) the structure of<br/>singularities in dimension four, (3) singularities of Kaehler-Ricci<br/>flow, (4) the structure of Perelman's entropy and reduced distance,<br/>and (5) applications of geometric flows to problems in<br/>physics. Progress toward these objectives will lead to new<br/>applications of Ricci flow in the geometry and topology of manifolds,<br/>productive insights into parallels between various geometric flows,<br/>and new applications of curvature flows to problems motivated by<br/>materials science and physics. These objectives are well suited to<br/>collaborations with other researchers in geometric evolution equations<br/>and in related fields like comparison geometry, low-dimensional<br/>topology, and nonlinear analysis.<br/><br/>The partial differential equations that arise in curvature flows are<br/>remarkably similar to equations used to model heat propagation, the<br/>movement of oil in shale and thin films, combustion in porous media,<br/>and certain effects in plasma physics. By increasing our understanding<br/>of singularity formation for such equations, the research elements of<br/>this project may contribute to progress in these applications.

The outreach<br/>component includes invitations to local undergraduate students to<br/>interact with the visiting researchers with the goal of attracting<br/>those students to further studies in mathematics. The project will<br/>benefit undergraduate education in two other ways: the investigator<br/>will develop a new course in optimal geometry and integrate it into<br/>the liberal-arts honors curriculum at the University of Texas, and the<br/>investigator will organize and direct an undergraduate<br/>learning-by-discovery project in which students investigate<br/>combinatorial curvature flows.<br/>"

I will also work on a more general theory of characteristic classes. This should lead, in particular, to a generalization of the Chern-Simons classes from local systems to arbitrary D-modules. This, in turn, should lead to better understanding and generalization of Riemann-Roch theorems for determinants of cohomology. Another direction of my research will be the theory of modules over deformed algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold. First, I intend to define a new category of modules with some additional structure; it should be related to the Fukaya category. The former should be regarded as a local limit of the former. Next step would be to make this category non-local and therefore even more closely related to the Fukaya category.<br/><br/>My research deals with several related topics. One is noncommutative geometry, much of it consists of the usual calculus, but carried out in such a way that the identity xy=yx is no longer valid. We refer to algebraic systems in which this is the case as noncommutative spaces. The other is deformation quantization, namely the study of the examples and structure of noncommutative spaces, rather than of laws and rules of noncommutative calculus. The word deformation refers to the fact that one obtains these noncommutative spaces by taking a usual (curved, higher-dimensional) space and changing it a little bit in noncommutative direction. (The word quantization is used because the passage from the classical to the quantum mechanics is the principal example). Yet another direction of my research is index theory, which is a discipline linking the number of solutions of systems of equations (differential, integral, etc.) to the topological complexity of underlying spaces. It is deeply related to noncommutative geometry because two operations that you can apply to a function, multiplication by x and derivation, do not commute.<br/><br/><br/>"

Regarding geometric flows, the principal investigator plans to study higher codimension mean curvature flow, which is the gradient flow for the area functional.  More precisely, we plan to study mean curvature flow deformation of Lagrangian submanifolds. In his thesis, the principal investigator showed that finite time singularities are unavoidable, i.e.,  they occur in many cases where experts were hoping they would not occur, and then he  proved the optimal result about the infinitesimal behavior of singularities. We plan to investigate other settings on which we can understand singularities and also to understand the size of the singular set at the time of the first singularity. This last question is very challenging and a satisfactory answer would be a breakthrough in the field. Regarding the relationship between curvature and topology we plane to investigate which constant scalar curvature metrics does a 3-manifold admit. More specifically, we intent to extend the investigator's previous work and hope to unveil a large class of manifolds $L$ for which $M$ and $M\#L$ have the same ``type'' of constant positive scalar curvature metrics. <br/><br/>The underlying philosophy of many problems in geometric analysis is to given a geometric object  being able to find another geometric object carrying the same type of information but having better properties. For instance, if one is studying the paths that go from A to B, the best possible path would be the one with shortest lenght. Both problems addressed in this research project obey this guiding principle. In the first one we try to use a heat -equation flow method to deform certain kinds of Lagrangian submanifolds into those that are still Lagrangian but have the least area possible. This is expected to have very nice applications in mathematical physics (more precisely in the SYZ conjecture). In the second problem we try to understand which geometric information does a constant scalar curvature metric carry. It is known that for surfaces these metrics determine its topological type. For 3-manifolds it is know that constant Ricci curvature determines the manifold. It is an important open problem to understand, for 3-dimensional manifolds, the information that can be extracted from constant scalar curvature metrics.<br/><br/>"

One example is the conformal deformation of Riemannian metrics by their scalar curvature (the so-called Yamabe flow). An interesting question is whether the solution approaches a metric of constant scalar curvature or whether the flow may develop a singularity. (The answer is known in dimensions 3 -- 5, but the general case is not yet fully understood.) A solution to this problem will likely require a good understanding of the local properties of the solution in a neighborhood of a blow-up point. Another tool that is likely to be relevant is the positive mass theorem in general relativity. It would also be interesting to see whether similar ideas can shed light on the prescribed scalar curvature problem in higher dimensions.<br/> <br/>The proposed project lies at the intersection of three areas of mathematics: differential geometry, nonlinear partial differential equations, and the calculus of variations.

Professor Schoen is also proposing to study the construction of submanifolds which are calibrated by the special lagrangian calibrating form. He plans to apply ideas from geometric measure theory to this problem. He also plans to study hamiltonian stationary submanifolds in dimension greater than two; in particular, the hamiltonian stationary tangent cones will be studied. Professor Schoen intends to investigate stable minimal surfaces which remain stable under coverings with the hope of showing that these are holomorphic in general situations. Finally, he intends to study geodesic completeness properties of hypersurfaces in Minkowski space of constant Gauss-Kronecker curvature. <br/><br/>Professor Schoen's project will lead to a better understanding of solutions of the Einstein equations of General Relativity. A better theoretical understanding is essential for the success of accurate numerical modeling of solutions. Numerical modeling is important for predicting the nature of the gravitational radiation which arises from dynamic situations, and NSF currently has a large project, LIGO, which is attempting to measure this radiation. He believes that the theoretical work of this project will be helpful for the numerics. The remainder of Professor Schoen's proposed work involves the use of geometric methods to understand the behavior of surface interfaces, such as soap films and soap bubbles, of varying dimension which arise in physical situations. These natural geometric objects can be used to describe subtle properties of the spaces in which they reside. These spaces arise in physical models such as string theory where they play a basic role.<br/>"

One project is to extend her analysis (in<br/>previous joint work with Abreu) of the symplectomorphism group<br/>for rational/ruled manifolds of dimension four to similar<br/>manifolds in higher dimension.  Many new problems arise here<br/>because the manifold is no longer fibered by pseudoholomorphic<br/>curves.

As first<br/>discovered by Hamilton over 150 years ago, many spaces of<br/>interest to physicists have this kind of structure.  For example,<br/>it underlies the equations of motion of energy-conserving systems<br/>such as the planetary system, since here each position coordinate<br/>is paired with a momentum coordinate to form a basic<br/>two-dimensional object.  Symplectic geometry also has much<br/>relevance to modern theories of physics such as string theory and<br/>mirror symmetry.  In recent years there has been a very important<br/>exchange of ideas between mathematics and physics that is largely<br/>expressed in symplectic terms.  Hence it is very important to<br/>further our understanding of the fundamentals of symplectic<br/>geometry.

A precise relation between topological string amplitudes (or Gromov-Witten invariants) of the Calabi-Witten computations were performed and found to be in complete agreement with the conjecture.  It is proposed to provide the foundations of this new theory and greatly expand on these new connections between geometry and string theory, in the process enriching both fields.  <br/><br/>In the past few years a deep connection has been found between microscopic constituents of black holes and cycles with minimal volume inside manifolds.

One typically studies critical points of energy,<br/>for example minimal submanifolds, which appear in all of the<br/>above proposed projects.  These have a long and distinguished<br/>history in both mathematics and physics, and remain subject to<br/>much attention.  Absolute energy minimizers are rare and<br/>difficult to locate.  However one source of them is calibrated<br/>submanifolds, of which both associative and special Lagrangian<br/>submanifolds are examples.  Special Lagrangian submanifolds have<br/>other interesting applications to physics.  In super-symmetric<br/>string theory, the universe is modeled as a ten-dimensional<br/>object, consisting locally of the familiar four-dimensional<br/>space-time, and a six-dimensional space (a Calabi-Yau manifold)<br/>that is compact, and hence sufficiently 'small' that one does not<br/>observe it in everyday life.  A popular approach to deepening our<br/>understanding of these Calabi-Yau manifolds is to study their<br/>special Lagrangian submanifolds.<br/><br/>"

For instance, delicate information about geodesics and geometry at different scales in these spaces can be gleaned from the behavior of random walks on discrete models and the study of certain ergodic measures on their geometric boundaries. For random walks on nonamenable groups, a basic question has been to understand the relationship of its Poisson boundary to other natural geometric boundaries. Starting with the work of Furstenberg, and continuing with the work of many others, much progress has been made in understanding when Poisson boundary measures for a random walks on important classes of nonpositively curved groups can be supported on their geodesic boundary. However, much less is known about what measures can arise this way. The first part of the proposed research seeks to show that many of the classes of ergodic measures arising from geometric constructions on the ideal boundary are represented by Poisson boundaries. We are also interested in groups which are not nonpositively curved, yet share some common features such as the mapping class groups or the diffeomorphism group of a circle. This represents a natural outgrowth of the PI's work with R. Muchnik. The second proposed direction of study examines the barycenter method as a tool for understanding manifolds admitting nontrivial maps to nonpositively curved manifolds. This is a differential geometric application of the study of boundary measures. By relating the volume and large scale geometry of a manifold, we wish to use these methods to realize further extensions of Mostow rigidity.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A number of remarkable developments in both mathematics and the physical sciences have revealed how random processes in a given system often reflect certain structural features of that system. For example, an ant randomly stepping one unit north, south, east or west in the Euclidean plane will eventually return to its starting point with probabilistic certainty. However, this no longer holds when one allows an additional degree of freedom of movement, say up and down in the third dimension. Hence, the recurrence property of this ""random walk"" detects the dimension of the ambient space. We propose to study the flexibility of such connections between the geometry of the underlying space and certain random processes. We especially are interested in understanding when generalized random walks on important families of spaces can produce a prescribed set of measurements. From another point of view, these auxiliary measurements themselves capture other intrinsic aspects of these spaces, and can sometimes indicate ""rigidity"" of the space. This refers to the phenomenon whereby a weak equivalence between spaces implies a strong equivalence. We hope to discover new ways in which rigidity arises.<br/><br/>"

Sobolev spaces<br/>of weakly differentiable maps appear naturally in the solution of<br/>variational or differential equations problems, but the<br/>fundamental theorems on Sobolev spaces of maps between regions in<br/>Euclidean spaces are not necessarily reproduced for maps between<br/>manifolds.  Topology in the domain and range of a mapping space<br/>can prevent approximation of an arbitrary Sobolev map by smooth<br/>maps and can force singularities to appear in solutions to<br/>variational problems.  The principal investigator's work aims to<br/>understand the analytical description of some of these<br/>topologically forced singularities.  Some particular topics<br/>include the rectifiability of defect measure of a general Sobolev<br/>map, Ginzburg-Landau type approximation for maps which are not<br/>weak limits of smooth maps, gap phenomena, extension of maps with<br/>energy control, travelling waves in planar antiferromagnets, and<br/>singularities of minimizing p-harmonic maps.

For example, the path of a beam of<br/>light follows the shortest route between two points, minimizing<br/>time and distance.  An important mathematical device for solving<br/>such ""variational problems"" is sometimes called the direct<br/>method: a sequence of realizable configurations that drive energy<br/>down toward a lowest possible value is used to construct a<br/>genuine minimizer, usually by picking out a subsequence that<br/>converges.  To make this process work mathematicians tend to work<br/>in enriched environments such as the Sobolev spaces cited above.<br/>These make convergence easier to establish, and then one has to<br/>show that the candidate minimizer is actually present in the<br/>original setting.  It is a relatively recent discovery that this<br/>procedure sometimes fails if the domain and range of the maps<br/>being studied has a bit of topological complexity, and the<br/>principal investigator's projects seek to analyze the nature of<br/>these occasional failures.<br/><br/>"

In fact, some important PDEs cannot be properly stated without the language of differential geometry (Einstein's equations in general relativity give one such example).  The PDEs that arise in geometry are often highly nonlinear and require new techniques to solve, posing new challenges to both geometers and to analysts.  Some of these new techniques developed for geometric PDEs have led to important developments for other PDEs.

The final goal of the first one is the topological classification of surface singularities; it aims to generalise the classical work of Artin and Laufer (and the author) about rational and elliptic singularities by identification of natural subfamilies beyond elliptic singularities, and topological determination of their analytic invariants.  There is a special emphasise on hypersurfaces with rational homology sphere (RHS) links, when the author (with R. Mendris) conjectured that even the embedded topological type can be recovered from the link (hence, predicting an even sharper property than Zariski's `multiplicity conjecture'). The second part is motivated by a conjecture of L.I. Nicolaescu and the author  which connects a certain Seiberg-Witten invariant of a RHS--link with the geometric genus of the singularity  (as a generalisation of a conjecture of Neumann and Wahl valid for  integer homology sphere links).  The proposal targets the limits of  the generalised conjecture. The new ingredients are provided by the  recently invented Heegaard Floer homology (of Ozsvath and Szabo). The third part focuses an unexpected development of the second part applied in the classical open problem of classification of rational (uni)cuspidal projective plane curves. The author (in his joint article) formulates very strong criterion conjecturally satisfied (and in many cases verified) by the local topological types of singularities which can appear as singularities of such projective curves. It appears that it is much stronger than the existing criterions, conjecturally it even has a classification power. Its connection with Heegaard Floer theory is striking. <br/><br/>Mathematical models which describe geometrical objects present in the real life or in the nature are represented by functions, or by the set where they are zero. In general, a function in a generic point behaves `nicely', but at some special points it may have some anomalies: these phenomena are  described by singularity theory. Its mathematical methods vary rather  diversely, it uses techniques from topology, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, number theory; in this way the results and the theory becomes very interesting (and difficult), it alloys different aspects.  The proposal targets surface singularities, and the proposed problems lie  in the core of singularity theory (which has revived recently with a large intensity). The proposal lines up a series of new objects and new methods which conceptually modify the general picture.  The proposer's research will be integrated in the process of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training."

They<br/>arise in symplectic geometry as reductions, in algebraic geometry<br/>(where they are called Deligne-Mumford stacks) as certain moduli<br/>spaces, and in topology as quotient spaces. Algebraic invariants<br/>of these spaces, such as stringy Betti numbers, twisted Hodge<br/>numbers, and Chen-Ruan cohomology (also called orbifold<br/>cohomology) have recently gained interest because they are subtle<br/>enough to see the singularities, and in some cases describe the<br/>cohomology of a (crepant) resolution of singularities. This grant<br/>will explore new methods to compute the Chen-Ruan cohomology of<br/>an orbifold, following work done by the PI and coauthors in the<br/>case that the orbifold is a global quotient by a compact abelian<br/>Lie group. These methods should produce a new combinatorial<br/>fomula for the Chen-Ruan cohomology of a hypertoric variety (a<br/>hyperkahler reduction of quaternionic n-space by a compact<br/>torus), a formula for the K-theory of global abelian quotients,<br/>and the Chen-Ruan cohomology of non-abelian (Lie group)<br/>quotients. We hope to use these methods to discount or prove<br/>certain conjectures about or bifolds and crepant resolutions. In<br/>a separate undertaking, the PI is pursuing a general<br/>combinatorial formula for questions about the equivariant<br/>cohomology of manifolds with circle actions and isolated fixed<br/>points. We have found a topological formula for the restriction<br/>of certain canonical classes to any other fixed point, which has<br/>led to a kind of classification in 6-dimensions. In higher<br/>dimensions, we have found a ""positive"" restriction formula in the<br/>case that the manifold is Kahler and carries an invariant<br/>Palais-Smale metric (or has other rather rigid structure, such as<br/>being a GKM space). This work should lead to combinatorial<br/>formulas for the product structure in the equivariant cohomology,<br/>a topic of broad interest because it applies to flag manifolds<br/>and toric varieties, among other varieties. In a third project,<br/>we propose to investigate different formulae for the structure<br/>constants in Schubert calculus using methods developed on the<br/>calculus of Bott-Samelson manifolds. This should also generalize<br/>to fixed-point restriction formulas in the case of a symmetric<br/>group (the fixed points of an involution on G) acting on G/B.<br/><br/>This research has roots in classical mechanics. Phase space,<br/>which consists of the position and momentum of a particle, is an<br/>example of a symplectic space, with an action by the symmetry<br/>group, also called a Hamiltonian action. Symmetry arises from the<br/>fact that the physics is the same for all observers. By<br/>""collapsing"" a high-dimensional symplectic space by the<br/>symmetry, we can get a smaller space that is sometimes easier to<br/>work with. In a broad sense, this grant is concerned with<br/>describing these spaces with group actions, and their<br/>quotients.

Schwartz proved a general surgery theorem for many of these groups, along the lines of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem, and he hopes to use this theorem to analyze some concrete examples.  The second problem has to do with triangular billiards.  Recently Schwartz proved that a triangular shaped billiard table has a periodic billiard path provided that all its angles are less than 100 degrees.  This represents the first substantial progress on the 200-year old triangular billiards problem, which asks if every triangular shaped billiard table has a periodic billiard path.  The third problem has to do with the iteration of simple geometric constructions, such as barycentric subdivision.<br/><br/>The common theme to Schwartz's research is the idea of looking at the consequences of performing a simple operation infinitely often.  In nature one sees great complexity in things like trees and coral reefs, and this complexity is often produced by the same process happening multiple times.  For instance, some kind of basic branching operation produces the shape of a tree.  The problems studied by Schwartz are idealizations of the sort of thing one might see in nature - for instance, a complex hyperbolic discrete group encodes the way light bounces of mirrors in a certain curved 4 dimensional space, and the triangular billiards problem asks what happens if one plays pool on a frictionless pool table with a billiard ball that is the size of a point. The barycentric subdivision problem is somehow an idealization of the idea of chopping up a high dimensional diamond over and over again, and studying the shapes of the facets."

A curvature surface of M is a smooth connected submanifold S such that for each x in S, the tangent space to S at x is equal to a principal space of the shape operator of M at x. This generalizes the classical notion of a line of curvature on a surface in the Euclidean 3-space. The hypersurface is said to be Dupin if along each curvature surface, the corresponding principal curvature is constant. The hypersurface is called proper Dupin if it is Dupin and the number g of distinct principal curvatures is constant on M.  An important class of compact proper Dupin hypersurfaces consists of isoparametric hypersurfaces, which are compact hypersurfaces whose principal curvatures remain constant everywhere. It is known that g=1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 for a compact proper Dupin hypersurface, where the first three cases have been well understood; they are Lie equivalent to, i.e., are transforms of, isoparametric hypersurfaces via Mobius maps and parallel transforms. The conclusion is not true when g=4, or 6. However, in these two cases one can form the cross ratio of any four principal curvatures. It has been conjectured that a compact proper Dupin hypersurface is Lie equivalent to an isoparametric hypersurface if the cross ratio of any four principal curvatures is constant. We have settled the case for g=4 when the multiplicities of the principal curvatures are of the form (m,m,1,1). (In general, they are of the form (m,m,n,n).) We propose to settle the entire conjecture, for g=4, by investigating an intriguing link between Dupin hypersurfaces and the invariant theory of homogeneous polynomials. In the resolution of the aforementioned conjecture for multiplicities (m,m,1,1), the analyticity, or more generally, algebraicity, of a compact proper Dupin hypersurface that we established via real algebraic geometry, palys a crucial role, in that one can reduce the global study to a local one. A compact proper Dupin hypersurface is known to be a taut hypersurface, which is essentially one for which all Morse distance functions have the same number of critical points of index k as the k-th Betti number (with Z_2 coefficients). The Kuiper conjecture states that a compact taut hypersurface is algebraic. We have established the conjecture when the nowhere dense wild set of the manifold, where the principal curvatures change multiplicities, is controllable in an appropriate sense. We propose to settle the Kuiper conjecture by establishing this controllability for all compact taut hypersurfaces. Morse theory applied to studying the topology of a curvature surface through a point in the wild set to establish a generic foliation seems to hold the key.<br/><br/>A type of Hamiltonian systems naturally arises in gas dynamics, hydrodynamics, chemical kinetics, Whitham averaging procedure, etc., is the hydrodynamic type. Remarkably, the subtype of the weakly nonlinear Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type is in one-to-one correspondence with the class of Dupin hypersurfaces, which need not be compact in general. It turns out that the classification of weakly nonlinear Hamiltonian systems rests exactly on the irreducibility condition, satisfied by a compact proper Dupin hypersurface, which is important in our proposal. The analyticity, or more generally, algebraicity, of a proper Dupin hypersurface, compact or not, joins hand in hand with the irreducibility condition to reduce the classification to a local problem of investigating some local invariants of homogeneous polynomials. The outcome of our proposal would contribute significantly to the understanding of the system of hydrodynamic type in various applications.<br/><br/>"

These moduli spaces are the<br/>center of many branches of mathematics and physics. Continuing<br/>his previous works, the PI first proposed to prove the Mumford<br/>goodness of several canonical metrics including the Ricci metric<br/>and the Kahler-Einstein metric on the moduli space of Riemann<br/>surfaces. The goodness of these metrics will allow one to apply<br/>Chern-Weil theory to these moduli spaces which are<br/>noncompact. The PI hope to develop a method to study the<br/>intersection theory on the moduli spaces via differential<br/>geometry by using the goodness. To study the goodness of the<br/>Kahler-Einstein metric, except for the continuity method, the PI<br/>proposed to investigate the Kahler-Ricci flow on the moduli<br/>spaces. More generally, the PI proposed to study the Kahler-Ricci<br/>flow on non-compact and quasi-projective manifolds where the<br/>potential function of the initial metric is unbounded with mild<br/>growth. The PI proposed to prove that the Kahler class and the<br/>goodness of the initial metric are preserved under the<br/>Kahler-Ricci flow. Also, the long time existence and convergence<br/>of the Kahler- Ricci flow will be studied. Furthermore, the PI<br/>proposed to investigate the negativity of various metrics on this<br/>moduli space and harmonic map theory which will lead to various<br/>vanishing and rigidity theorems. The PI also proposed to extend<br/>his methods to the moduli space of stable bundles and study<br/>vanishing theorems by using canonical metrics.<br/><br/>The theory of moduli space of Riemann surfaces has many<br/>application in mathematics, physics and computer graphics. The<br/>intersection theory on the moduli spaces is one of the key parts<br/>in the modern string theory. Furthermore, it leads to significant<br/>improvements in image recognition, compression and<br/>decompression. The traditional method is to triangulate a surface<br/>by picking millions of vertices and record the combinatoric<br/>data. Thus a huge amount of calculations are needed. In<br/>differential geometry, the Torelli theorem tells us that the<br/>complex structure of a surface is determined by its Hodge<br/>structure. Thus one only need to record the data of the Hodge<br/>structure of a surface in order to reconstruct the surface. The<br/>size of the data of the Hodge structure is much smaller than the<br/>size of the data from triangulation. Thus a numerically efficient<br/>method to link a surface and its Hodge structure will<br/>dramatically simplify the procedure of image processing and<br/>improve its efficiency and accuracy.<br/>"

In fact, time independent questions are basically Riemannian in nature. For examples the classification of black holes is based on time independent solutions of the field equations; the (first) proof of the positive mass theorem is also based on Riemannian Geometry. At present researchers are interested in issues involved in the rigorous extension and generalization of the principal geometric and physical structures associated with the spaces of classical and relativistic physics (e.g. of Riemannian geometry) to Finsler spaces. One of the problems of basing Relativity on Riemannian Geometry is the difficulty with ""casualty"". This is due to the fact that geodesics in Riemannian Geometry are reversible. If a space-time admits a CTC (closed time-like curve) then one could travel back in time and all kinds of (murderous) paradoxes could occur. In contrast, there exist Finsler metrics for which the geodesics are irreversible hence, provides a more natural setting for dealing with ""casualty"" in Relativity. <br/><br/>There are many issues, more technical in nature, involving Finsler Geometry that are useful in Relativity. Among these are: <br/>(a) spaces whose metric functions are symmetric polynomials depending on four variables of the third order (known as Chernov spaces in Finsler Geometry), <br/>(b) spaces whose metric functions are symmetric polynomials depending on four variables of the fourth order (known as Berwald-Moore spaces in Finsler Geometry), <br/>(c) multi-linear symmetric forms as Finsler extension of scalar product, <br/>(d) connection between Finsler spaces and hypercomplex numbers, <br/>(e) possibility of extending, in the Finsler setting, the Lorentzian splitting theorem, originally conjectured by S. T. Yau as the natural extension of the Riemannian splitting theorem of Cheeger and Gromov. <br/>"

Mainly he applies the methods and ideas from noncommutative geometry to the study of differential geometry, and vice versa. Tang studies orbifolds from the point of view of proper etale groupoids and their groupoid algebras. He computed Hochschild and cyclic cohomology of the deformation quantization of these groupoid algebras. He is further studying the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the groupoid algebras to address the Ginzburg-Kaledin conjecture on the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology. As an extension to the study of orbifolds, Tang will investigate more complicated quotient singularities. In particular, he will continue his study of flat connections on groupoids and stacks. Another application of noncommutative geometry to differential geometry concerns algebraic index theorem. The algebraic index theorem of deformation quantization was developed by Fedosov-Nest-Tsygan. Tang will apply their ideas to study index problems on orbifolds and quantized contact transformations. In the other direction, applying techniques from differential geometry to noncommutative geometry, Tang studies Connes and Moscovici's Rankin-Cohen deformation of a Hopf algebra, which was originally constructed on modular form in number theory. The main geometric input is symplectic geometry of the space of leaves of a foliation.  The connection between symplectic geometry and number theory will also be investigated. Tang is working on developing a notion of a hopfish algebra as a generalization of a Hopf algebra. It is known that a noncommutative torus algebra is not a Hopf algebra, however, a candidate for a hopfish structure on a noncommutative torus algebra has been discovered. The analysis of this structure will be will continued. Finally, noncommutative super geometry and complex geometry will be investigated, e.g. Q-algebras and gauge theory, examples of noncommutative complex manifolds. <br/><br/>Tang's research concerns the interplay between two fields of mathematics, differential geometry and noncommutative geometry. Differential geometry provides a mathematical formulation of classical physics, and noncommutative geometry gives a rigorous foundation for quantum physics. Analogous to the relation between classical and quantum physics, the development of differential geometry provides tools, intuition, and inspiration for the study of noncommutative geometry and vice versa. In one direction, Tang uses differential geometry to understand deformation of quantum groups, which was originally constructed from modular forms in number theory, and to develop more general notion of quantum symmetry, and to look for more examples of noncommutative supermanifolds and complex manifolds; in the other direction, using tools developed in noncommutative geometry, Tang studies problems in differential geometry which are hard to solve using classical geometry tools, e.g. orbifolds and singular spaces, and various index problems.   <br/><br/>"

The recent solutions by Klyachko of the eigenvalues of a sum of Hermitian matrices problem and by Knutson and Tao of the saturation and Horn conjectures are of particular relevance to this proposal. Both these problems are associated to the group of invertible n by n matrices. The discovery of quantum cohomology and the quantum Schubert calculus led to the solution of analogous problems for the group of unitary n by n matrices. The PIs P.Belkale, T. Haines, M. Kapovich, S. Kumar and J. Millson propose to attack for a general reductive group G the problems previously solved for the groups of invertible unitary n by n matrices. The history of Lie theory has shown that it is of critical importance to understand in the context of general Lie groups results proved initially for the group of invertible n by n matrices.<br/><br/>A large part of mathematics and physics has been involved with the study of eigenvalues, for example determining the modes of vibration of a violin string or the energy levels of an atom amounts to finding eigenvalues of a Hermitian linear operator. A fundamental problem is to determine the possibilities for the eigenvalues of the sum of two operators given the eigenvalues of each one. Another fundamental problem with its roots in physics is the problem of studying the representations of an abstract group as a group of matrices. This problem in turn has been organized into subproblems. One of the most important of these is the problem of decomposing (tensor) products of representations as sums of representations. The point of this proposal is that these two basic problems, the eigenvalue of the sum problem and the decomposing (tensor) products problem are very closely related. The authors propose to pin down this relationship (already well-understood for special cases) for the general case. This FRG grant will play a fundamental role in the further development of a national group of scientists working on the area common to Lie theory, topology, algebraic and symplectic geometry, combinatorics and the theory of buildings. A class of young mathematicians especially graduate students and postdocs in the mid-Atlantic area (including Washington and Chapel Hill) and the greater (San Francisco) bay area (including Davis) will have the opportunity to learn about and work on exciting and fundamental problems through the Meetings and Workshops envisaged by the PIs. This class already includes the nine graduate students presently advised by the PIs. We expect to include other graduate students and postdocs associated to the very strong programs in representation theory and geometry at the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California at Davis. We also expect that graduate students, postdocs and faculty from neighboring universities such as Johns Hopkins, Duke, North Carolina State University, UC-Berkeley and Stanford will participate in and profit from the FRG grant.

The methods will build on the successful solution of this problem in the case of three principal curvatures.  As in that case, the first step will be to prove that the multiplicities of the principal curvatures satisfy the relations required by an isoparametric hypersurface.  A new feature when there are more than three principal curvatures is the cross ratio of any four principal curvatures.  The next step is to prove that if this cross ratio is constant, then it must equal its value in the isoparametric case.  Given the correct conditions on the multiplicities and the cross ratio, the final step is to prove that irreducibility implies that the hypersurface is equivalent by Lie sphere transformations to an isoparametric hypersurface.  In each case, the method of moving frames will be used to study the local differential geometry of Dupin hypersurfaces in Lie sphere geometry.<br/><br/>A surface in ordinary space is called isoparametric if its principal curvatures are constant.  This condition is so restrictive that the only examples are planes, spheres, and circular cylinders.  If each principal curvature is assumed constant only along each of its lines of curvature, then the surface is called a cyclide of Dupin.  Cyclides are used by mechanical engineers because of the way such surfaces can be fit together along their circles of curvature.  A cyclide that is not isoparametric is the torus of revolution, which is the surface of an ordinary doughnut.  Any cyclide with two distinct principal curvatures can be obtained from a single torus by rigid motions, inversions in spheres, or parallel translations (the locus of points a fixed distance from the surface).  All such transformations generate the group of Lie sphere transformations.  In more variables, there are many remarkable isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres, but they can have only 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 distinct principal curvatures.  Dupin's cyclides generalize to the idea of Dupin hypersurfaces in spheres.  These include the isoparametric hypersurfaces.  There is a local construction that builds a new Dupin hypersurface from one of smaller dimension.  A Dupin hypersurface is called irreducible if it is not built by one of these constructions.  For an isoparametric hypersurface with four distinct principal curvatures, the cross ratio of the principal curvatures is constant.  The goal of this proposal is to prove that, if an irreducible Dupin hypersurface has four distinct principal curvatures with constant cross ratio, then it is a Lie sphere transformation of an isoparametric hypersurface.<br/><br/>"

In recent work, Dr. Epstein has shown that the dbar-Neumann boundary condition has a symplectic analogue for Spin-C manifolds with contact boundary. This work is based on the notion of tame Fredholm pairs of projectors. Dr. Epstein will further explore this category and these boundary value problems, to obtain explicit formulae for the index of the Spin-C Dirac operator and gluing formulae under various convexity conditions. He will also use this framework to investigate the unmodified dbar-Neumann problem on a strictly pseudoconvex symplectic manifold, to see if there is a reasonable analogue of the Bergman projection, and if its range defines a useful analogue of holomorphic functions in the non-compact symplectic context.<br/><br/>In many mathematical and physical problems a question of principal interest is: how many solutions does a partial differential equation have? For certain classes of equations, a partial answer to this question, called the ""index"" of the equation, can be provided that does not depend on the details of equation. It is computed from the geometry of the space on which the solutions are defined. Dr. Epstein's work is broadly directly toward clarifying the relationship between this counting procedure and which aspects of the geometry of the underlying space are important determinants of the final result. One such approach to this problem involves cutting the space into parts and describing how the indices of the parts can be combined to compute the index of the whole.<br/>"

The first specific class of projects involves continuing work with T. Riviere, on relations between the p energy of a map between Riemannian manifolds and its homotopy class. In case of nontorsion homotopy, our previous results on the geometric and topological structure of bubbles allows attack on open questions about the weak smooth approximability of Sobolev maps as well as refined questions about bubbling in p stationary maps and heat flows.  We also are attacking higher order Sobolev spaces which seem more natural for certain homotopy classes, but for which basic approximation results and constructions have not been previously studied, A second class of projects involves continuing work with Thierry De Pauw on extending notions from geometric measure theory and solutions of Plateau-type problems in the context of chains in a metric space with coefficients in a general group. We consider a variety of mass-type functionals and the notion of a scan which generalizes the finite mass metric-space currents of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and the rectifiable and flat Euclidean-space G-chains of White.  In the Euclidean space context we approximate the size functional of Almgren and prove optimal regularity for the minimizers of such approximate functionals.<br/> <br/><br/>Solutions to many variational problems in both pure and applied mathematics often are forced to have singularities, that is, to involve regions where large oscillations occur.  For example a nematic liquid crystal material in a spherical container whose optical axis is forced to point outward on the container necessarily will have singularities inside (observable through cross-polarizers or x-ray diffraction).  In this example the optical axis has an energy density, which measures its local rate of change and whose integral tends to have a minimum value among all possible configurations. Our research proposes to understand the relationship between energies in such variational problems and the topological barriers imposed by the physics of these problems.  We have derived new notions which allow the treatment and precise description of a wide variety of problems from soap films and their higher dimensional generalizations to optimal transport paths in various complex media.  Geometric constraints which occur naturally in many physical problems have led to new mathematical and computational issues. In particular, two that we are studying are the constant cross-sectional area constraint exhibited in plant structure and gradient constraints in the microstructure formation in certain crystalline materials.<br/>"

The latter include general compact sets, but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies, or finite sets.  One advantage of this setting is that it becomes more probable that inverse problems have a unique solution. Generally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of uniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information than would otherwise be possible.  This can lead to algorithms that are more effective when few measurements are available, and less sensitive to measurement errors or noise.  Geometric tomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry, Minkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will continue the development of geometric tomography.  New directions include the study of conjectured strong affine inequalities involving (dual) affine quermassintegrals; geometric tomography where Lebesgue measure is replaced by Gaussian or other measures; several projects on discrete tomography and a discrete Brunn-Minkowski theory; a complete solution to Hammer's X-ray problem to reconstruct convex bodies to arbitrary accuracy from a fixed finite set of X-rays; a new algorithm for reconstructing convex bodies in any dimension from noisy support functions; and other new reconstruction algorithms in geometric tomography, including proofs of convergence by an application of the theory of empirical processes.

They take X-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the information to create an image of a two-dimensional section of part of the body. The mathematics behind this process is called computerized tomography.  It is very successful, but not perfect; the reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better picture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays, causing greater expense and likelihood of side effects.  In geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects are allowed - the density of the object is the same everywhere inside it.  An example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney.  One can use this extra information to find better reconstruction procedures.  The scope of geometric tomography is actually much wider.  Any measurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered. Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both in mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the geometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside.  For example, a new technique called local stereology depends on measurements of planar sections of biological tissue; each section passes through a fixed point, usually the nucleus of a cell, and the measurements can be made optically rather than physically. This project continues the development of several aspects of the mathematics of geometric tomography. Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.<br/><br/>"

By comparison, local harmonic analysis uses only local<br/>analysis on small balls. As an example of the impact of global<br/>geometry, ergodicity of the geodesic flow implies the uniform<br/>distribution of eigenfunctions in the unit cotangent bundle. A<br/>new result in this direction is part of the proposal: ergodicity<br/>of the geodesic flow can be used to determine the asymptotics of<br/>the complex nodal hypersurface of eigenfunctions.  In another<br/>direction, sup norms of eigenfunctions are related to existence<br/>of focal points for the geodesic flow and to the first return map<br/>on geodesic directions at the focal point (a joint project with<br/>C. Sogge and J. Toth). Asymptotic geometry aims to apply similar<br/>methods to study problems in complex geometry, in particular to<br/>the program of Yau, Tian, and Donaldson to study approximation of<br/>all hermitian metrics on a positive line bundle by Bergman<br/>metrics. A joint project with J. Song is to use asymptotics of<br/>Bergman kernels on toric varieties to study a problem of<br/>Phong-Sturm on how the geometry of the symmetric space of Bergman<br/>metrics of height N approaches the Monge-Ampere geodesic geometry<br/>of the full infinite dimensional space of hermitian metrics. In<br/>another direction, an ongoing joint project with B. Shiffman is<br/>to study statistical algebraic geometry of high degree varieties<br/>as the degree tends to infinity. This has applications in string<br/>theory (joint work with M. Douglas).<br/><br/>Both topics involve the application of ideas and methods<br/>regarding the relation of classical and quantum mechanics to<br/>geometry and analysis. In each area there is a small ""Planck's<br/>constant"" which tends to zero. In the global analysis of<br/>eigenfunctions, it is one over the eigenvalue; in geometry it is<br/>the degree of a polynomial. As the ""Planck constant"" tends to<br/>zero, analytic objects (quantum mechanical) such as<br/>eigenfunctions or Bergman kernels tend to geometric objects<br/>(classical mechanics), which are much easier to<br/>understand. Physicists, engineers and mathematicians have been<br/>studying the relations between classical and quantum mechanics<br/>for almost a hundred years now, but the relations are so<br/>difficult that fundamental problems remain. To take a venerable<br/>example, Chladnyi first demonstrated two hundred years ago that,<br/>if one puts sand on a vibrating drum, the sand will move to the<br/>""nodal line"".  Despite the two hundred years, no one knows how<br/>nodal lines snake around on general drums. One project above is<br/>to determine the ""complex"" nodal line when billiards played on<br/>the drum move in a chaotic way. Thus if one ""thickens"" the nodal<br/>line in complex directions, one can understand how it snakes<br/>around on chaotic drum heads.<br/>"

A primary  goal is to get a better understanding of the structure of  convex bodies. To do so she uses techniques from different areas of mathematics: analysis, differential geometry, convexity theory, probability theory. She investigates isoperimetric inequalities and   affine isoperimetric  inequalities. These provide  powerful tools in characterizing and classifying  convex sets. Through her investigation of the affine surface area -originally a  concept of affine differential geometry and occurring in the affine isoperimetric inequality- she was lately led to an extensive study of questions of approximation of convex bodies by polytopes . The affine surface area appears naturally in this context as it is related to the boundary structure of a convex body. The PI has investigated and still is investigating different aspects of approximation of convex bodies by polytopes. In one paper, for instance, she -together with her collaborator- proved the surprising result that random approximation by polytopes (choosing the vertices of the approximating polytope  randomly on the boundary of the body) is as good as best approximation. Besides convexity tools, probabilistic tools, like concentration of measure, have proved  to be very efficient in convexity. The PI continues her investigation of such probabilistic results for advancing her research in structural results in convexity and its applications to local Banach  space theory and quantum information theory.<br/><br/>Past experience has led the PI to believe that purely theoretical concepts are also useful in applications. She has experienced that the methods and results from these areas find applications in other fields of mathematics  and in applied areas: Geometric tomography, a tool having its origins  in classical convexity theory, gives a method to recover convex shapes from its sections or projections. This is used in computer  vision and image analysis, in biology and medicine where convex shapes (organs) occur naturally. Geometric algorithms find applications in computer science. To be more explicit, a mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases, and this grant will study some of these patterns that are recent discoveries.<br/>"

In his solution to Calabi's conjecture, Yau proved the<br/>existence of a Kahler-Einstein metric on compact Kahler manifolds<br/>with vanishing or negative first Chern class. An alternative<br/>proof of Calabi's conjecture is given by Cao using the<br/>Kahler-Ricci flow. However, most projective algebraic varieties<br/>do not have definite or trivial first Chern classes.  Recently<br/>Perelman has made major breakthrough in Hamilton's program as an<br/>approach to the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization<br/>conjecture. The principal investigator proposes to study the<br/>canonical metrics on the canonical models of projective varieties<br/>of positive Kodaira dimension by applying the Kahler-Ricci<br/>flow. Such canonical metrics are constructed by the deformation<br/>of the Kaher-Ricci flow on minimal projective surfaces of<br/>positive Kodaira dimension. These generalized Kahler-Einstein<br/>metrics can be considered as an analytic version of the abundance<br/>conjecture in algebraic geometry and will also lead to new<br/>advances in the understanding and application of the Ricci<br/>flow. In Donaldson's far reaching program, the geometry of the<br/>infinite dimensional symmetric space of Kahler metrics in a fixed<br/>class is related to the existence and uniqueness of constant<br/>scalar curvature Kahler metrics. The principal investigator also<br/>intends to study the uniform approximation problem of the<br/>Monge-Ampere geodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by<br/>those in the finite dimensional Bergman spaces on toric<br/>varieties. The precise understanding of this problem will give<br/>new insight into the conjecture proposed by Yau between the<br/>relation of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics and certain<br/>stability in the sense of geometric invariant theory. The<br/>principal investigator will also apply the moment map point of<br/>view and study various geometric flows arising from Kahler<br/>geometry as well as symplectic geometry proposed by<br/>Donaldson. The first is the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of<br/>functional related to the Mabuchi energy. The second is a moment<br/>map flow in a hyperkahler four manifold.

Mainly he applies the methods and ideas from noncommutative geometry to the study of differential geometry, and vice versa. Tang studies orbifolds from the point of view of proper etale groupoids and their groupoid algebras. He computed Hochschild and cyclic cohomology of the deformation quantization of these groupoid algebras. He is further studying the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the groupoid algebras to address the Ginzburg-Kaledin conjecture on the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology. As an extension to the study of orbifolds, Tang will investigate more complicated quotient singularities. In particular, he will continue his study of flat connections on groupoids and stacks. Another application of noncommutative geometry to differential geometry concerns algebraic index theorem. The algebraic index theorem of deformation quantization was developed by Fedosov-Nest-Tsygan. Tang will apply their ideas to study index problems on orbifolds and quantized contact transformations. In the other direction, applying techniques from differential geometry to noncommutative geometry, Tang studies Connes and Moscovici's Rankin-Cohen deformation of a Hopf algebra, which was originally constructed on modular form in number theory. The main geometric input is symplectic geometry of the space of leaves of a foliation.  The connection between symplectic geometry and number theory will also be investigated. Tang is working on developing a notion of a hopfish algebra as a generalization of a Hopf algebra. It is known that a noncommutative torus algebra is not a Hopf algebra, however, a candidate for a hopfish structure on a noncommutative torus algebra has been discovered. The analysis of this structure will be will continued. Finally, noncommutative super geometry and complex geometry will be investigated, e.g. Q-algebras and gauge theory, examples of noncommutative complex manifolds. <br/><br/>Tang's research concerns the interplay between two fields of mathematics, differential geometry and noncommutative geometry. Differential geometry provides a mathematical formulation of classical physics, and noncommutative geometry gives a rigorous foundation for quantum physics. Analogous to the relation between classical and quantum physics, the development of differential geometry provides tools, intuition, and inspiration for the study of noncommutative geometry and vice versa. In one direction, Tang uses differential geometry to understand deformation of quantum groups, which was originally constructed from modular forms in number theory, and to develop more general notion of quantum symmetry, and to look for more examples of noncommutative supermanifolds and complex manifolds; in the other direction, using tools developed in noncommutative geometry, Tang studies problems in differential geometry which are hard to solve using classical geometry tools, e.g. orbifolds and singular spaces, and various index problems.   <br/><br/>"
