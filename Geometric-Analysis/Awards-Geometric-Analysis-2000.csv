On the other hand, many mathematical models explaining ecological phenomena lack a substantial corroborating empirical validation.  These weaknesses are in part due to the broad spectrum of knowledge required to develop an integrated conceptual framework in the study of ecological systems.  This project is a multi-disciplinary collaborative effort, combining an array of different - but interrelated - areas of expertise.  These areas involve the mathematical fields of geometry, topology, continuum mechanics and computational inverse problems; the fields of scientific computation and information technology; and the fields of wildlife ecology and spatial methods in biodiversity.  Interdisciplinary collaborative initiatives can integrate recent breakthroughs in the various mathematical areas described above, with technological advances in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and spatial methods in the study of biodiversity and wildlife ecology.  Implementation and validation of models will lead to the translation of the hierarchy of models created into a network of interconnected programming modules, in a similar fashion to process modeling.  Such implementation should eventually have both simulation and prediction capabilities, which can be tailored to specific situations, involving various degrees of complexity.  Educational Initiatives will be implemented to create a human resources infrastructure with expertise on the subject.  Existing educational resources (REU and VIGRE grants) are being used to develop interdisciplinary courseware and interdisciplinary research activities.  These materials and the seminars and workshops supported by the Incubation Grant provide the basis for the implementation of a rigorous graduate program to train students in the application of advanced mathematics and scientific computation in ecology and environmental science.<br/><br/>Ecology and the environmental sciences have lagged behind the natural sciences in generating predictive models with management and industrial applications.  Although there is a great deal of theory on how natural systems function and how these systems are impacted by human activities, we do not have a good understanding of how to best restore damaged ecosystems, or how to predict the long-term consequences of human activities.  Natural systems are extremely complex and are influenced by both regular, predictive processes like the changing seasons, and by rare, severe events like storms and fire.  The interactions among species are also complex.  If scientists are ever to develop a reasonable predictive capability regarding natural systems, then they must be able to describe and model natural systems with increasing accuracy and precision.  This means that they must be able to develop mathematical models and descriptions of these systems and computational methods to analyze them.  This project will develop several pilot research endeavors to begin cross-disciplinary collaboration among ecologists, mathematicians, and computer scientists. In addition, the project will hold workshops and seminars to initiate the creation of a graduate degree program in mathematical and computational ecology, to train a new generation of researchers to better manage and restore our natural systems.<br/><br/>"

Our<br/>main goal is to develop the 3-dimensional cut-and-paste techniques<br/>involving convex surfaces and ``bypasses"" into a largely<br/>combinatorial one. The investigators propose to import ideas and<br/>constructions from the theory of foliations and laminations (in<br/>joint work with J. Etnyre and W. Kazez). Convex surfaces and<br/>bypasses aid the decomposition of a tight contact manifold<br/>(eventually) into balls, similar to the `` sutured manifold<br/>decomposition"", due to Gabai.  The ``dividing curves on the<br/>surfaces along which the cuttings take place determine the tight<br/>contact structure.  A project which is currently under way is to<br/>carefully follow the sutured manifold decompositions of Gabai in<br/>constructing taut foliations on most 3-manifolds, and to construct<br/>tight contact structures by gluing in much the same way as Gabai's<br/>construction.  We hope to produce an effective gluing theorem for<br/>tight contact structures.  Another direction of research is<br/>Legendrian knot theory. Using the classification of tight contact<br/>structures on solid tori, Etnyre and Honda propose to classify<br/>Legendrian torus knots and Legendrian figure eight knots. <br/><br/>The investigators propose a study of 3-dimensional spaces.  The<br/>3-dimensional spaces we study will locally be similar to the<br/>standard Euclidean 3-dimensional space.  These objects may be very<br/>complicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the<br/>difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a<br/>flat plane or a very large sphere.  `Finite' 2-dimensional spaces<br/>have been classified and understood for a long time - they are the<br/>2-dimensional sphere, the doughnut, the doughnut with 2 holes, the doughnut<br/>with 3 holes, etc., and are distinguished by the number of holes. <br/>However, in spite of work by numerous mathematicians this century,<br/>a complete classification of 3-dimensional spaces is far from<br/>understood.  In our work we seek to better understand 3-dimensional<br/>spaces by imposing an additional structure, called a contact<br/>structure, which, very loosely speaking, amounts to choosing a<br/>preferred direction (or a spinning axis) at every point in the<br/>3-dimensional space.  Contact structures have intimate connections<br/>with 4-dimensional geometry, quantum physics, and dynamics (such as<br/>fluid dynamics), and we hope to gain better understanding of<br/>3-dimensional spaces through contact structures. <br/>"

The conference is designed <br/>to enhance the research and educational atmosphere of the <br/>community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the <br/>surrounding states.  The conference has three specific goals.  <br/>First the conference is committed to bring researchers of national <br/>and international stature to the area to discuss their research <br/>and to interact with mathematicians from this geographic region.  Second the conference makes it possible for the community of <br/>geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a <br/>huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular<br/>basis, which both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools.  Third the <br/>conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. There will be six conferences over three years, hosted by major universities in Texas: <br/>2000-2001: Rice University (fall), Texas Christian University (spring)<br/>2001-2002: University of Texas (fall), Texas Tech University (spring)<br/>2002-2003: Texas A&M University (fall), University of Houston (spring)<br/>In addition, two universities (University of Texas at Arlington, University of Texas at Dallas) will assist in the conference at Texas Christian University.<br/><br/>The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 23 times to date.  The roster of mathematicians who have participated in the conference includes many of the most influential geometers and topologists in the world.  Each conference specifically tailors its program to reflect recent developments in important areas of geometry and topology.

Freed<br/><br/>The geometry group at the University of Texas proposes to carry<br/>out a variety of research projects, most of which are related to<br/>physics.  Dan Freed's current research focuses on questions in<br/>geometry and topology arising from string theory.  These include<br/>the construction of determinant line bundles on manifolds with<br/>boundary and the understanding of anomalies of actions which<br/>arise in quantizing lagrangian field theories.  Karen Uhlenbeck's<br/>current research involves the geometric theory of integrable<br/>systems, as well as a non-linear Schroedinger equation arising in<br/>macroscopic theories of a ferro-magnetic continuum. These two<br/>researchers are starting a project aimed at understanding the<br/>appearance of integrable systems in conformal field theories.<br/>Bob Williams is applying his expertise on attractors to the<br/>construction of tiling spaces.  Constantin Teleman is pursuing<br/>several projects in the cohomology of infinite dimensional Lie<br/>Algebras. He and his coworkers are making progress on the<br/>MacDonald conjectures, and are also giving geometric<br/>interpretations in terms of the Hodge cohomology of flag<br/>varieties of loop groups.  He is also interested in homotopy<br/>equivalences between holomorphic and continuous mapping<br/>spaces. Postdoctoral members of the group are Nurit Krausz, who<br/>is working on direct computations for quantum field theory in<br/>Minkowski space, and Adrian Vajiac who uses equivariant<br/>localization techniques to study topological quantum field<br/>theories.<br/><br/>At this point in time, geometry is a rapidly developing area of<br/>mathematics.  While research in geometry, like most of pure<br/>mathematics, consists of the construction and development of<br/>abstract concepts, the origins and ultimate applications for<br/>these constructions are invariably examples and applications in<br/>more applied fields. The influence of theoretical physics on<br/>geometry is strong.  For example, large numbers of geometers are<br/>currently working on questions related to quantum groups, mirror<br/>symmetry and quantum cohomology. Our group attempts not to work<br/>on problems which have already been identified by mathematicians<br/>as central, but in contrast we look at current ideas in physics<br/>of all sorts and then find, clarify, and work on the<br/>mathematically interesting questions more directly.  Dan Freed's<br/>work on string theory connects the physics ideas of quantization<br/>with the mathematical subject of algebraic topology.  His joint<br/>project with Karen Uhlenbeck on the appearance of integrable<br/>systems in certain quantum field theories requires an<br/>understanding of field theory, integrable systems, and the very<br/>important and basic ideas of symmetry.  Constantin Teleman's work<br/>deeply involves fundamental ideas of symmetry, as well as delving<br/>into the question of how closely very messy functions can be<br/>approximated qualitatively by polynomial-like objects. Some of<br/>the geometric ideas come from other branches of physics, such as<br/>the ferro-magnetic equations studied by Uhlenbeck.  The tiling<br/>spaces of William's come from beautiful examples such as those<br/>constructed by Roger Penrose.  Our efforts bring new ideas and<br/>techniques into mathematics, rather than concentrating on<br/>projects which are already popular.<br/>"

The goal of the program is to capitalize <br/>on recent progress in contact geometry. It seems that the time is ripe now<br/>for new breakthroughs in the field, and that the concentration of both<br/>established and young researchers in contact and symplectic geometry and <br/>related areas, as well as participation of several graduate students, may <br/>help to produce new remarkable results.

Wang and R. Berger, the<br/>undecidability of certain questions regarding tilings and aperiodic<br/>tilings have been studied.  But as we extend our horizons and consider<br/>tilings in more general contexts than the Euclidean Plane, we see that<br/>many foundational questions are still open.  In any particular,<br/>reasonably well-defined setting (e.g., ""tilings in the hyperbolic<br/>plane by polygonal tiles, moved about by orientation-preserving<br/>isometries""), there are several intertwined questions that may be<br/>asked: 1) Is there a general method to determine whether a given set<br/>of prototiles admits a tiling that includes a specified configuration?<br/>(Is the ""Completion Problem"" decidable?; 2) Is there a general method<br/>to determine whether a given set of prototiles can tile the space at<br/>all?  (Is the ""Domino Problem"" decidable?)  3) Is there a ""weakly<br/>aperiodic"" protoset? (Such a protoset admits no tiling with a compact<br/>fundamental domain.); 4) Is there a ""strongly aperiodic"" protoset?<br/>(Such a protoset admits no tiling that is invariant under an<br/>infinite-cyclic symmetry); 5) Is there a computable bound on the<br/>Heesch number of protosets?; Is there a computable bound on the<br/>isohedral number of protosets?; 7) Is the period problem decidable?<br/>We consider conjectures concerning some of these questions in two<br/>settings that have been thought about for 20 years: protosets in the<br/>hyperbolic plane and monotiles in the Euclidean plane; and we sketch a<br/>number of proposed approaches to these problems.  We feel these<br/>techniques should generalize and shed light on many foundation al<br/>issues in discrete geometry.<br/><br/>We hope the project will be significant in several ways.  First, these<br/>problems, which have largely been seen as isolated from each other,<br/>can all be seen as tightly connected.  It is anticipated that<br/>techniques will arise that will shed light on several aspects of this<br/>problem.  But moreover, the techniques under consideration may link<br/>these questions in several topics in low-dimensional geometric<br/>topology and combinatorial algebra.  Finally, questions of<br/>decidability and tractability are one of the central concerns of<br/>theoretical computer science; form one point of view, we are simply<br/>exploring a particular example, but hope that the techniques we<br/>develop will be of more general use.<br/>"

Spectral analysis can be roughly <br/>characterized as the study of how a space vibrates.  <br/>More precisely, to a curved space is associated a certain <br/>partial differential operator, the Laplacian.

Suppose one suspends a finite number of mirrors in space, and places an object in the vicinity of the mirrors.  Looking at the object through the mirrors, one might see an infinite, regular pattern, like trees in an orange grove.  On the other hand, one might see a confused and chaotic pattern, full of partial and overlapping images.  The first case corresponds roughly to what s called a discrete group and the second corresponds roughly to what is called an indiscrete group.  The basic question one would like to study is: which positions of the mirrors lead to the discrete alternative?  In the case of Schwartz's research, the space in which the mirrors are suspended is a curved 4-dimensionaluniverse called complex hyperbolic space.  This space is an exotic cousin of the famous non-Euclidean spaces constructed by Gauss and Lobachevsky more than a hundred years ago.<br/><br/>The second topic involves simple constructions in straight-line geometry.   The classical theorems in projective geometry, such as Pappus's theorem and Desargues theorem, can sometimes be applied over and over again, rather than just once.  The result is a kind of dynamical system, involving an infinite family of points and lines.  The mathematics behind the dynamical system usually transcends the mathematics behind the original result.  For instance, one example studied by Schwartz leads to connections with integrable partial differential equations,  determinental identities,  and alternating sign matrices.  Schwartz proposes to continue investigating these dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The third topic involves computer aided mathematics.   One frequently encounters a situation where the computer says that a certain result is true, but a proof is nowhere insight.  Schwartz plans to investigate several situations where it might be possible to use the output of the computer directly as the basis of a proof that the result is true.  In other words, the computation itself becomes the justification of the result.  More concretely, Schwartz would like to try to deduce the entire orbit structure of certain kinds of dynamical systems based on a finite amount of information on the orbit.  Obviously such a goal would only work in special situations. <br/>"

Hence, these representations critically depend upon intersection algorithms.  To minimize data volume and improve algorithmic performance, the intersection sets are only approximated.  The consequences of these approximation errors may be far from trivial and can lead to `gaps' or `cracks' between surfaces that are understood to be adjoining.  Unfortunately, the prevalent practice is that intersection algorithms do not give any error bounds on these approximations.  This research focuses upon the central issue of the interdependencies between topology of a model and the approximations within numerical algorithms.  Any formal notion of topology for computational representations of geometric sets must specifically acknowledge the role of approximation and finite arithmetic.  This project will develop formal definitions and computational representations for needed approximation bounds.  Computational experiments will be performed to test the communication of the critical approximation information across programmatic interfaces.  The expected result is a formal framework for reasoning about the propagation of topological tolerances within large software systems.<br/><br/>Three recent workshops (OPAAL '97 in New Orleans, CAD/CFD '99 at Davis, and MSRI '99 at Berkeley) have directed attention to the need for rigorous mathematical foundations for computer-aided design.  Particularly troublesome are regions where surfaces should meet, as computational models are limited to only approximating such surface joinings.  A computational model of a coffee cup will necessarily have small cracks along its base and near its handle.  If fluid were to be placed in this cup in a computer simulation, the fluid would leak out of the cup.  Of course, similar cracks will exist in a computational model of an airplane; for example, where the wing joins the fuselage.  The performance characteristics of this joint during flight are crucial to aircraft safety.  Fluid dynamic simulations are performed on airplane models to verify critical engineering performance characteristics.  Even small errors in the geometric model can cause large errors in these engineering simulations.  These simulations hold the promise of significant cost savings by permitting creation of a reliable airplane directly from the electronic model.  However, to attain that goal, the interface between modeling and simulation must accept the inevitability of modeling `cracks' and still produce valid engineering analyses.  This project will create new mathematical formulations and computational representations as a necessary step for reliable engineering simulations.  Recent economic studies done for NIST indicate that these engineering problems cost about 1 billion dollars annually, for the automotive industry alone.  Hence, there is opportunity for significant practical economic impact from this new theory, as it will improve results from complex engineering simulations which must be executed within high-performance computing environments.  Utilization of these high performance computing resources will be improved and the more reliable engineering estimates will also lead to direct savings in material and manufacturing costs for major industries.<br/><br/>"

Incorporating many of the above mentioned<br/>objects of all types into a single global geometric framework<br/>effected as an atlas over the phase space, is the second, and the<br/>main goal. Apropos of ""Aubry-Mather sets"", this will require<br/>mutual interpretation of the results obtained via variational<br/>methods of Lagrangian mechanics and geometric implicit function<br/>theorems, such as KAM, of Hamiltonian approach.<br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on instability as a generic feature<br/>of complex mechanical systems, be it the Solar system, or a<br/>polyatomic molecule. In order to describe such, one needs to know<br/>the present state of the system, and the equations of its future<br/>evolution. Typically, due to their complexity, one cannot obtain<br/>the solutions of these equations with the initial conditions<br/>incorporated. Otherwise, and this is an exceptional case, the<br/>system is called integrable. Such would be the Solar system if<br/>one considers only the interaction of each individual planet with<br/>the Sun, disregarding in particular the mutual gravitational<br/>attraction between the planets, etc. Yet the laws of motion are<br/>known exactly, the initial state of a system has to be measured,<br/>which leads to errors, however small. The hypothesis of<br/>instability, alias ""Arnold's diffusion,"" suggests that two<br/>infinitesimally different initial conditions may result in two<br/>qualitatively different scenarios ad infinitum. In particular,<br/>this is believed to be true for small perturbations of integrable<br/>systems, e.g. if one takes into account the influence of the Moon<br/>or Jupiter on the orbital motion of the Earth. The suitable<br/>mathematical enviroment to model the systems in question is<br/>provided by geometrical mechanics. The technological motivation<br/>for this research comes from molecular chemistry and biology<br/>where billions of years it would take the instability to develop<br/>itself on a cosmic scale, translate into fractions of a second.<br/>"

Binary trees appear as parameters in: (1) Hierarchical clustering problems, for instance for micro-array data from contemporary genetics; (2) Methods that use decision trees such as the Classification and Regression trees (CART); (3) Estimation of phylogenetic trees built from DNA data for the taxonomy of species, but also for building `gene trees'.  The embedding of tree estimation in a statistical framework allows one to see trees as a special type of parameter to be estimated.  However the estimation procedures have been developed without the ability to construct confidence regions for these paramters or ways of comparing various estimators of these parameters.  Currently biologists validate the tree estimated by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the DNA sequences and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to the branches of a consensus tree.  This reduces the problem to a collection of binomial simulations, losing much of the multivariate information of which groups appear simultaneously.  This new constructive geometrical approach uses the tools available from topology and algebraic combinatorics.  Collaboration with a combinatorialist, Louis Billera, and a topologist, Karen Vogtmann, on a more mathematical understanding of tree space allows a more natural definition of distances between points in the `tree polytope'.  This topological study of tree space is crucial in the definition of a notion of neighborhood that then allows a definition of continuity of the estimation function.  The space of trees is a space with negative curvature.  It is also possible to define geodesics on this space and convex hulls.  The notion of confidence region can be defined, and it is possible to combine trees from built from different datasets or to combine trees obtained from different genes or even compare trees with other data (biogeographic, for instance).<br/><br/>Understanding the geometry of ""tree space"" helps understand how to combine and compare trees.  Whether they are hierarchical clustering trees built for micro-array DNA data or family trees built from DNA sequences, binary tree data are abundant in today's genome era.  The current proposal aims to consider trees as a whole, instead of breaking them down into just sibling relationships as is done currently.  This problem uses recent results from topology and the geometry of spaces with negative curvature, like the surface of a hyperboloid.  In these spaces notions of average and distance have to be redefined, the hardest being ways of representing what is not naturally representable in our usual euclidean space.  The challenges are both computational and geometric.<br/>"

Lian<br/><br/>This project addresses problems in three closely related areas in<br/>the context of mirror symmetry and duality. As a continuation of<br/>current joint work with K. Liu and S.T. Yau, Lian proposes to<br/>both generalize and specialize their theory (""mirror principle"")<br/>for studying characteristic classes of vector bundles on a stable<br/>map moduli space. First, this work has thus far considered convex<br/>projective manifolds.  Dropping the convexity assumption is<br/>important if one wishes to consider general Calabi-Yau<br/>manifolds. Part I of this proposal outlines an approach which is<br/>expected to lead to the full generalization of mirror principle<br/>in in genus zero. The main new input here is a way to combine the<br/>difficult machinery of virtual cycles and the many ingredients of<br/>the mirror principle. Second, the mirror principle can be<br/>specialized to surfaces and many new questions which have<br/>recently arisen in local mirror symmetry, as well as enumerative<br/>geometry on surfaces.  In the former case partition functions of<br/>a given genus are related to modular forms whenever the<br/>underlying surface is elliptic. In the latter case, enumerating<br/>curves of a given genus with suitable incidence in a surface also<br/>yields modular forms. This project seeks to understand modularity<br/>from the point of view of characteristic classes of vector<br/>bundles on stable map moduli spaces. For positive genus, the<br/>mirror principle requires yet another generalization.  In Part II<br/>of this project, Hosono, Lian, Liu and Yau will examine these new<br/>questions. In recent joint work of Hosono, Lian and Yau, they<br/>have settled the problem of constructing the ubiquitous large<br/>radius limit for the ""universal"" family of Calabi-Yau<br/>hypersurfaces in a toric manifold. In Part III Lian, Todorov and<br/>Yau will study this limit for more general families.<br/><br/>String physics is an ambitious effort to unify all the<br/>fundamental forces of nature. A remarkable prediction of String<br/>Theory is that nature apparently allows for many different<br/>versions of spacetimes.  A major current problem in string<br/>physics is to understand how a plethora of apparently different<br/>spacetimes are related, often in an unexpected and remarkable<br/>ways, under the rubric of ``String Duality''. Mirror symmetry is<br/>a special yet nontrivial case of String Duality. Though they come<br/>in vast variety, the spacetimes in questions are still highly<br/>restricted.  They turn out to be a class of geometrical objects,<br/>known as Calabi-Yau manifolds, which have been studied by<br/>mathematicians for over 100 years.  Physicists have discovered<br/>that string theories associated to certain pairs of Calabi-Yau<br/>manifolds (""mirror pairs"") are equivalent.  This project aims at<br/>understanding the geometry of these mirror manifolds from the<br/>mathematical point of view.  A constant exchange of insights and<br/>feedback between physicists and mathematicians on mirror symmetry<br/>and other issues has been a hallmark of String Theory in its last<br/>20 years of development.<br/>"

The Willmore flow has been recently shown to have short-time solutions, but the investigator considers whether it can fail to have long-time solutions.  This project also studies configurations for knots which minimize ropelength, giving new lower bounds for the ropelength of small knots, and new asymptotic bounds on the growth of ropelength with crossing number.  Finally, the investigator uses his experience with numerical modeling of curves and surfaces to give new understanding of geometrically natural discretizations for quantities related to curvature.<br/><br/>     Many real-world problems can be cast in the form of optimizing some feature of a shape; mathematically, these become variational problems for geometric energies.

Cell membranes are more complicated bilayer surfaces which minimize an elastic bending energy known mathematically as the Willmore energy.  Knotted curves achieve an optimal shape when a rope is pulled tight, or if a charged knotted wire repels itself electrostatically; understanding such configurations helps explain the behavior of biological molecules like DNA.  This project explores such phsically natural problems, which remain challenging from both theoretical and computational standpoints.<br/><br/>"

The primary<br/>spectral data associated to a compact Riemannian manifold are the<br/>eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.  The investigators<br/>propose to apply recently developed methods to study the extent<br/>to which the eigenvalue spectrum determines the local geometry of<br/>a compact Riemannian manifold.  They will also ask the extent to<br/>which additional spectral data such as the spectrum of the<br/>Laplacian acting on differential forms of various degrees<br/>determines the geometry of the manifold.  Inverse spectral<br/>problems will be considered on Riemannian orbifolds as well as on<br/>manifolds; orbifolds are the most tractable singular spaces.  For<br/>the Schrodinger operator ""Laplacian plus potential"", the problem<br/>of recovering the potential from spectral data will be studied in<br/>the case of line bundles over tori.  In analogy to the case of<br/>planar domains, the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a<br/>compact Riemannian manifold may be viewed as the fundamental<br/>tone.  The question of whether random Riemann surfaces have large<br/>first eigenvalue will be studied using connections between<br/>spectra of Riemann surfaces and spectra of graphs.

By the ``shape space'' we mean<br/>the space of either similarity classes or congruence classes of<br/>N-gons.  In recent joint work with Alain Chenciner, this<br/>three-pronged approach proved its utility by yielding a hitherto<br/>unknown orbit for the three-body problem.

The chief technical difficulty to be<br/>overcome in successfully applying the method is that of avoiding<br/>collisions between the masses.  Unlike the action in problems<br/>with strong-force potentials, the action with the Newtonian<br/>potential admits finite-action solutions with collision.  One<br/>knows very little about minimizers with collision. In particular<br/>they need not be regularized in any of the various senses.  The<br/>proposer will focus on the collisions.  If an action minimizing<br/>sequence tends to a curve with collisions, under what<br/>circumstance are those collisions Levi-Civita regularized?

He also pointed out the central<br/>importance of periodic orbits to the problem. Periodic orbits are<br/>motions of the masses which repeat the same pattern indefinitely<br/>like a point going around a circle.  We propose to find new<br/>periodic solutions to the three-body problem and the N-body (N is<br/>four, five, six,...)  problem by using a combination of<br/>methods. The methods themselves are not new, but their<br/>combination is.  This approach has already proved successful in<br/>one instance -- by yielding a new solution in which three equal<br/>masses chase each around a figure eight curve, never catching<br/>each other.  Our work could lead to further significant advances<br/>in the understanding of the N-body problem. The techniques may<br/>prove to be useful in other dynamical situations.

Hardt<br/><br/>This project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus,<br/>treating the behavior of singularities and energy concentration<br/>for various optimal or stationary functions, fields, or geometric<br/>structures subject to geometric or analytic constraints. Specific<br/>investigations focus on the relation between energy and<br/>topological obstruction in mappings between manifolds,<br/>ferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials, improper slicing of<br/>polynomial varieties, compactness of currents in Carnot groups,<br/>and the regularity of relaxed energy minimizers. We will<br/>investigate the energy concentration along area-minimizing sets<br/>for limits of singularities of p-energy minimizing maps as p<br/>approaches a critical power.  In various higher dimensional<br/>cases, energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings may<br/>occur along sets of infinite measure and is related to<br/>homotopically nontrivial mappings of spheres. Singularities in<br/>ferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials will be also studied<br/>in both stationary and dynamic contexts. The theories of improper<br/>intersections of polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry<br/>will be investigated to understand related behavior in analysis<br/>and partial differential equations. A theory of currents in<br/>Carnot groups will be studied with an eye on applications to<br/>variational problems.<br/><br/>Underlying many physical phenomena is a least-energy principle<br/>whereby certain configurations or fields or geometric shapes are<br/>distinguished by their property of having less energy or area<br/>than competing objects. The external constraints often lead to<br/>singularities, which are special points characterized by rapid<br/>changes of structure occurring in very small spatial regions. For<br/>example, one observes dislocation faults in solids under stress,<br/>domain walls in magnetized materials, vortices in superconducting<br/>materials, liquid edges and corners in soap films, and point,<br/>curve, and surface defects in various liquid crystal<br/>materials. We deal with new mathematical structures and theories<br/>necessary to explain and predict such phenomena.  In these<br/>problems, the theoretical studies of pure mathematics, the<br/>numerical computational studies of applied mathematics, and the<br/>phenomenological studies from physics all benefit each other and<br/>all have a crucial scientific role.<br/>"

There is a natural<br/>Riemannian metric on both classical and universal Teichmueller<br/>spaces, called the Weil-Petersson metric.  Although those spaces<br/>are not symmetric spaces, and there are no classical Lie groups<br/>acting on them isometrically (unlike the hyperbolic spaces with<br/>the special linear group), one notes that on the classical<br/>Teichmueller spaces the mapping class group of the Riemann<br/>surfaces acts isometrically, and that on the universal<br/>Teichmueller space the diffeomorphism group of the circle acts<br/>isometrically.  These group actions on Teichmueller spaces can be<br/>utilized to construct flat bundles over various manifolds with<br/>its fibers being copies of Teichmueller spaces, which leads to<br/>the questions of strong/super rigidity.

Escobar<br/><br/>Professor Escobar proposes to work in three different variational<br/>problems: The first one is on conformal deformation of<br/>metrics. He proposes to work on the scalar curvature problem on<br/>scalar flat manifolds of dimension five or more.  In addition, he<br/>will study the prescribed scalar curvature and prescribed mean<br/>curvature problem on manifolds with boundary; particular<br/>attention will be given to this problem when the manifold is the<br/>Euclidean ball and the dimension is three.  Earlier<br/>investigations indicate that the problem in three dimensions is<br/>special. The second topic he proposes to study is estimates for<br/>the first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue on compact manifolds with<br/>boundary. Escobar proposes to study relations between the<br/>geometry of the space and the first non-zero eigenvalue and apply<br/>this information to problems in conformal geometry, heat flow<br/>problems, and to the study of eigenvalues of minimal<br/>surfaces. The third topic is to study Einstein metrics on<br/>manifolds with boundary. There are three different kinds of<br/>equations that arise naturally as a variational problem of a<br/>functional introduced by the proposer; they are Einstein metrics<br/>satisfying that the boundary is totally geodesic or, more<br/>generally, that the boundary is umbilic, and Ricci flat metrics<br/>with umbilic boundary.<br/><br/>The three problems above have their roots in Riemannian geometry<br/>as well as in physics. The Steklov problem initially appeared in<br/>physics, then in harmonic analysis, partial differential<br/>equations, conformal geometry, and minimal surfaces.  In physics,<br/>it describes the temperature of a body where the flux through out<br/>the boundary is proportional to the temperature. We will<br/>investigate how the geometry of the space influence the first<br/>non-zero eigenvalue, that is, the smallest nonzero constant of<br/>proportionality. The Einstein equation proposed in this project<br/>is the generalization of the Einstein's equation in boundaryless<br/>spaces studied by Hilbert and Einstein in general relativity to<br/>the case of spaces with boundary.  The boundary conditions we<br/>will imposed are the natural ones if one studies this problem<br/>from the point of view of the calculus of variations. The scalar<br/>curvature equations that we will investigate are the average<br/>version of the Einstein equation on manifolds with boundary.<br/>Nowadays they are known as the Yamabe type equations. These<br/>equations appear in relativity and in other branches of physics.<br/>"

These<br/>talks will address a broad spectrum of recent work in the<br/>subject, including lecture series by four leading researchers on<br/>partial differential equations and analytic methods, minimal<br/>surfaces, symmetries and isometries in Riemannian geometry, and<br/>Lagrangian cycles in symplectic geometry.

They are<br/>one of the few long standing lecture series in mathematics in the<br/>southeastern United States.  The subject of these lectures for<br/>2000 is differential geometry, the study of aspects of a space<br/>that can be captured by measures of length, angle, surface area,<br/>volume, and related notions.  Riemannian geometry concentrates on<br/>issues related to curvature, the measurable quantity that makes<br/>rigorous the notion that a flat plane and a round sphere are<br/>distinct even at very small scales of attention.  Symplectic<br/>geometry concerns an idealization of the structure underlying the<br/>Hamiltonian framework for mechanics, a structure that enables<br/>measurements of areas and volumes but does not require that<br/>length and angles be measurable.  Both of these flavors of<br/>geometric information have dramatic consequences for problems<br/>concerning efficient or optimal placement of objects such as a<br/>surface in a three-dimensional space, consequences which are<br/>mostly expressed in the language of partial differential<br/>equations and related ideas from mathematical analysis.<br/>"
