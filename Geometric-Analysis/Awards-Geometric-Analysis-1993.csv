The ultimate goal is to                   contribute to the understanding of statistical behavior in                      nonconformal expansive and hyperbolic dynamical systems,                        especially as it relates to the ""fractal"" geometry of repellers.                The more immediate aim is to elucidate the structure of                         self-affine sets,e.g., the relationship between Hausdorff and                   Bouligand dimensions and the natural dynamical systems associated               with such sets.  For this a better understanding of random matrix               products, especially their large deviations, seems essential. The               study of random matrix products, in turn, leads to questions                    concerning random walks on nonabelian groups and the theory of                  Gibbs measures and thermodynamic formalism: in particular, a                    significant component of the research effort will be directed to                producing accurate approximations to the transition probabilities               of random walks on discrete groups and semigroups, and developing               a theory of Ruelle-like operators appropriate for this purpose.                      Investigations into the behavior of certain chaotic                        dynamical systems will be conducted, in particular, those in                    which the phase space is stretched at different rates in                        different directions.  Unusual geometric objects that arise in                  the ""phase spaces"" of these dynamical systems, called                           ""repellers,"" and their connections with the nature of the                       dynamics will be closely studied.  The theory of probability                    predominates in these investigations: questions involving the                   behavior of ""typical"" orbits are studied by choosing an initial                 state of the system ""at random."" This viewpoint leads to related                problems in probability theory proper, mostly concerned with                    certain features of random walks on state spaces with a highly                  noneuclidean geometry (""matrix groups"")."

For example, in  Partial Differential Equations, we study the dependence of the  flows upon parameters, concentrating on the boundary conditions,  diffusion coefficients, dissipation coefficients and the shape of  the domain.  Comparison of flows defined by such equations will  be restricted mostly to the global attractors.  For Functional  Differential Equations, we will be primarily interested in  singular  perturbation problems which relate the solutions to the  properties of maps defined by limit equations.       Many physical systems are modeled by partial differential  equations defined on a bounded domain.  The study of the effects  of the domain (its shape, etc.) on the dynamics is of paramount  importance.  This is especially true if the geometric properties  ofl the domain act as a control variable, as, for example, those  included under lthe name lof optimal shape design, as well as  others.  Also, many domains are small in some directions and it  is advantageous to make a reduction to a lower dimensional domain  for design as well as computational purposes. The present  proposal addresses questions of this type.  In lazer optics and  models in ecology and biology, one encounters singularly  perturbed delay differential equations.  In such cases, the limit  equation for the singularly perturbed parameter equal to zero  is mapping.  We address in this proposal the relationships  between the dynamics of the delay equation and the dynamics of  the map.  ***"
