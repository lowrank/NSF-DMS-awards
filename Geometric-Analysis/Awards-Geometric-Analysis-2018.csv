How to compare and categorize these surfaces is an urgent and important problem.  This National Science Foundation funded project aims to develop mathematical theories for an efficient and speedy classification of digital surfaces.  A successful completion of this National Science Foundation funded project will have applications in medical imaging, game industry, engineering and many fields. Some of the earlier work of the PI in this area have already been used in health and game industries.  The project work will further advance this progress and develop deep mathematics based on the classical Riemann surface theory and conformal geometry. <br/> <br/>The classical theory of Riemann surfaces is a powerful tool for classifying surfaces up to conformal diffeomorphisms. The most important theorem in the theory is the Poincare-Koebe's uniformization theorem. The theorem has a wide range of applications within and outside mathematics. However, computation of uniformization maps and metrics on non-flat surfaces are very difficult in general. The goal of the proposal is to develop a theory of discrete conformal geometry for polyhedral surfaces, to establish the counterpart of the uniformization theorem in the discrete setting, and to prove convergence of discrete conformal maps to conformal maps. The PI will develop efficient algorithms to compute uniformization metrics through collaboration.  The main ingredient in developing a discrete conformal geometry is to define the notion of discrete conformality. In a recent joint work with collaborators, the PI introduced a notion of discrete conformal equivalence for polyhedral metrics on surfaces. The PI and his collaborators proved a discrete version of uniformization theorem for compact polyhedral surfaces and showed that discrete conformal maps converge to conformal maps on tori and disks.  There remain several major open problems of establishing the convergence of discrete conformal maps for all surfaces and proving the discrete uniformization theorem for all non-compact simply connected surfaces. The discrete conformality introduced by us is closely related to the work of Alexandrov, Pogorelov and Thurston on convex surfaces in hyperbolic three-space, the classical Wyle problem and the Koebe circle domain conjecture.  Tools developed in the classical area of mathematics will be used to solve the proposed problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This subject has seen major developments in the last few years. One of the most striking is the invention of modern invariants counting the number of curves with certain properties in spaces that are expected to be related to our current universe's space-time. A major breakthrough came from understanding that the computation of some of these invariants can be understood in terms of solutions of certain equations related to the geometry of so-called mirror spaces. While the initial description of these invariants was geometric in nature, work of Kontsevich and Costello suggests that an algebraic approach would lead to increased flexibility and more efficient computation. The goal of this project is to expand that work and define the invariants in such a way that existing results on the Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture will automatically imply that existing numerical predictions on curve-counts are correct.  <br/><br/><br/>Kevin Costello introduced in 2005 a categorical generalization of Gromov-Witten invariants, defined for all genera. Despite considerable interest, very little is known about these invariants. The first calculation of them, for the universal family of elliptic curves, was achieved by the PI in 2017, in joint work with Junwu Tu. In this project the PI expand the current understanding of these invariants. The PI will complete ideas originally proposed  by K. Costello, and then use the resulting theory to compute B-model Gromov-Witten invariants of positive genus for higher dimensional varieties, including the quintic threefold.  This will verify the validity of the mirror symmetry predictions in higher genus. The main approach will be to replace the geometric spaces with algebraic structures called categories of matrix factorizations. This is of independent interest in itself: the invariants of these categories should be closely related to the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants, but such a relationship is not explicitly known.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the flows considered in this project are differential equations that model how the shape of a geometric object changes as its area, volume, or some other geometric quantity decreases as rapidly as possible. For example, the surface area decreases most rapidly under the mean curvature flow (MCF), while the enclosed volume deceases most rapidly under the Gauss curvature flow (GCF).  Due to these natural decreasing properties, as the flow becomes singular (i.e., the object develops folds, corners, or other points of high curvature) these evolutions often tend (under magnification) toward optimal shapes minimizing the corresponding energies such as area and volume.  For example, a soap bubble is the shape of a rescaled singularity of the MCF. These energy minimizers appear not only in geometry, but also in economics and physics; for instance, optimal transport refers to a mapping from one area to another that minimizes an energy which is the total cost of resource allocation. Thus, studying singularity of the geometric flows sheds new insight on the?understanding of energy minimizers?in physics and economics.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the singularity of various geometric flows including the Gauss curvature flow (GCF), the mean curvature flow (MCF), and the Ricci flow (RF). For the MCF and the RF, the uniqueness of non-collapsed type II ancient solutions will be considered. For the GCF, the existence and the uniqueness of type II closed ancient solutions will be studied under suitable conditions.?Moreover, this project also examines the convergence to the translating solutions to the curve-shortening flow and the GCF.? Interior estimates, decay rate, and monotonicity formulas will be developed.?In addition, this project will also address optimal regularity and free boundary problems for the GCF and and other fully non-linear equations, including optimal transport and Monge-Ampere equations. This project will provide a method to utilize prescribed singularity conditions to obtain optimal regularity and free boundary regularity, in particular in free boundary problems that arise from quantitative economics and classical mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By the least action principle, the surface area of a soap film or a soap bubble will minimize among all films spanning the wire or among all bubbles including a fixed volume. The physical characterization of such surfaces says that the soap film and the soap bubble are respectively critical points of area or area subtracting enclosed volume. Mathematically, a soap film spanning a wire is called a minimal surface, and a soap bubble is called a surface of constant mean curvature (abbreviated as CMC). These two types of surfaces already caught interests by physicists and mathematicians in 1760s, and have been extensively-studied topics which also inspired the advances of many other subjects in mathematics and science. One general theory for proving the existence of such geometric objects, called the ""min-max theory"", has had striking recent successes, and will be the major object of study in this research program.  <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will conduct research on the min-max theory and its applications for CMC surfaces and minimal surfaces with free boundary. In the first subject, the PI intends to prove topological bounds for the min-max CMC surfaces by Heegaard genus in a given three manifold, as well as to prove the existence of multiple CMC surfaces for a given mean curvature. The PI also plans to establish the min-max theory for constructing surfaces with mean curvature prescribed by an arbitrary smooth function, generalizing that of the CMC surfaces where the curvature functions are constants. In the second subject, the PI will investigate the compactness property, properness property, and Morse index upper bounds of the free boundary min-max minimal surfaces obtained by the PI with collaborators before; as applications, the PI plans to study minimal surfaces in singular or non-compact spaces by approximations using the free boundary solutions. The PI will finish a program on constructing min-max minimal disks with free boundary using the theory of harmonic maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, these equations govern mathematically-defined processes that smoothly modify objects in a way that is driven by geometrically meaningful quantities such as length, area, volume or curvature.  The equations that the PI studies have very nice regularity properties, in the sense that bumpy objects often become smoother as they evolve; in fact, it is reasonable to expect that the object will gain more symmetries as the flow proceeds, and this will help us better understand the class of geometric objects we started with.  Unfortunately, these equations also have the potential to develop singularities in finite time, meaning that the solution may acquire sharp points and corners, and one cannot expect in general to have a smooth solution to the equation for a long time. In order for us to achieve our ultimate goal, and better understand the underlying geometric object using the flow techniques, we need to understand how to deal with singularities that may arise. These and similar topics have been the subject of several workshops in geometric analysis at Rutgers University organized by the PI (together with colleagues), attracting many graduate students and featuring both research talks and advanced graduate-course level lectures.<br/><br/>One of the aims of this project is the classification of ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows, such as, the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The PI proposes to combine the PDE techniques and geometric estimates to study the ancient solutions of such flows. Their classification is crucial for better understanding the singularities that occur in finite time. Ancient solutions to the two-dimensional Ricci flow describe trajectories of the renormalization group equations of certain asymptotically free local quantum field theories in the ultraviolet regime. The PI will classify ancient closed non-collapsed solutions to the three-dimensional Ricci flow, which would settle down a conjecture stated by Perelman in one of his papers. The PI shall also find minimal conditions that guarantee smooth existence of a solution to the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The PI also wants to understand singularity formation in the following sense: what the stable singularity models in four dimensional Ricci flow are. This is related to understanding the singularity formation of a four-dimensional Ricci flow starting at generic initial data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relationships between quantum-mechanical systems and their classical counterparts can be explored by investigating how the quantum-mechanical equations behave as the value of the parameter h tends to zero in some sense.  Pursuing this idea rigorously, however, involves subtleties.  Because h is not a dimensionless quantity, the ""smallness"" of values of the parameter must be expressed in terms of other relevant quantities.  This research project aims to deepen understanding of relationships between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics through rigorous mathematical analysis centered on the limit when the Planck constant h tends to zero.  The questions under study are of great interest both to mathematicians and to physicists.<br/><br/>This research project primarily concerns stationary states of quantum systems.  Global harmonic analysis is the use of the long-time dynamics of the geodesic flow of a Riemannian manifold to understand the high-frequency asymptotics of eigenfunctions.  Two of the most important goals of the project are (1) to analyze Lp norms of eigenfunctions and (2) to analyze nodal sets and critical point sets.  Making use of recent results relating geometric control and restrictions of eigenfunctions to hypersurfaces, the investigator aims to study nodal problems in non-ergodic situations and possible relations to the fractal uncertainty principle.  The project also includes exploration of several other topics, including the numbers of nodal domains of eigenfunctions on manifolds of higher dimension; Lp norms of eigenfunctions and microlocal Kakeya-Nikodym norms and their relations to analytic continuation to Grauert tubes; and the behavior of density of states of spectral projections for various Hamiltonians across natural interfaces such as energy surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching aim of these topics is to push forward our knowledge in mathematics as well as in physics. In particular, this involves geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with a focus on the Einstein equations in general relativity. The new insights and methods from this project will also be important to solve other structurally similar PDE, some of which are central to models in science and technology. One main branch of the PI's research concerns the Einstein equations linking the physical content of our universe to geometry, thus they give the physical laws a geometric structure. These equations are at the heart of the theory of general relativity, which governs the physics of our universe in the large. Exploring these equations will lead to a better understanding of the universe as a whole and of isolated systems such as galaxies, binary black holes or binary neutron stars.  The observation of gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) project in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era where information from distant regions of our universe is decoded directly from the universe itself (rather than from electromagnetic waves like for instance light in telescopes). More than ever, synergies between mathematics, in particular analysis of PDE and geometry, physics and astrophysics are needed to unravel the new structures. The PI will build on her results to develop new methods to achieve these goals. Through the educational component of this project, the PI's research will also have direct impact in a wider sense via teaching and outreach activities. The PI will train students and postdocs in these fields, and through broad outreach activities reach members of the public including underrepresented groups. The PI will also communicate her results through publications, conferences and the internet.<br/><br/>The PI will develop and explore new mathematical methods to investigate the Einstein equations and other nonlinear PDE describing physical phenomena. In particular, the PI proposes to study: (1) the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations focussing on spacetimes with radiation; (2) the mathematics of gravitational waves and their memory effect (a permanent change of the spacetime showing as a permanent displacement of test masses in a detector like aLIGO) in general relativity, as well as analogs of memory in other physical theories; and (3) Euler equations and other PDE per se and their coupling to the Einstein equations. Whereas all these topics center around a purely mathematical (geometric-analytic) treatment, each one of them will produce results that can be directly applied in physics experiments. Parts of the suggested research will continue the PI's former work linking her mathematical insights to experiments (aLIGO in particular). It is expected that the gravitational wave memory effect will be measured in the near future. These new projects will partially build on the PI's and collaborators' recent results and methods but will also require new ideas and approaches. The PI and D. Garfinkle derived two analogs of memory in electromagnetism, thus for the first time outside of general relativity. The PI and collaborators will continue their research to complete the understanding of memory in general relativity, and to extend their research to other physical theories (e.g., quantum electrodynamics). The PI will connect this line of research with her other project about the global Cauchy problem, and she will study other PDE with geometric-analytic methods. Moreover, solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to other PDE will be investigated for general situations, including asymptotically flat as well as cosmological spacetimes, and thereby interesting local and global structures are expected to be found. <br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental laws of nature are described in the language of mathematics using ideas from differential geometry and partial differential equations. Understanding the behavior of solutions to differential equations is an important part of understanding the structure of the universe. This proposal concerns a centuries-old class of mathematical objects called Monge-Ampere equations. These equations arise naturally in the study of geometry and are closely related to Einstein's equation in general relativity and the Hull-Strominger system from string theory. A main goal of this project is to develop analytical techniques to investigate the important properties of the solutions to this type of equations, which will lead to deep understanding of the fundamental geometric structures. The study requires a broad range of tools from real and complex analysis, as well as algebraic and differential geometry. Progress on these questions will not only shed some light on some basic problems in mathematics, but will also have applications in physics and other sciences.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the interaction between fully nonlinear partial differential equations and complex geometry. In particular, the investigator will study the solvability of complex Monge-Ampere type equations deduced from the study of a generalized Hull-Strominger system in string theory, which can be viewed as a generalization of Ricci-flat metrics on non-Kahler complex manifolds. Building on his joint work with Phong and Picard, the investigator will develop new analytic techniques for further understanding of this type of equation and to provide a complete answer to the question raised by Fu and Yau. Another major goal of this project is to study the anomaly flow, which was introduced by the investigator and his coauthors, aiming to develop analytical methods for solving the Hull-Strominger system on general three dimensional non-Kahler Calabi-Yau manifolds. Short-time existence of solutions of the flow were obtained in the joint work with Phong and Picard. The investigator will study the long-time behavior and convergence of this flow, and will also use this flow investigate the relation between the balanced cone and the Kahler cone on Kahler manifolds.

The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances between points on it by computing lengths along great circle paths.  (The Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly spherical.)  One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformed shape is somehow less appealing than the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this notion of being ""bent out of shape"" very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which minimizes the total energy. This idea can also be generalized to higher-dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of our planet. (For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe.) In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. The projects in this proposal are to define appropriate energies on such spaces, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the research of the PI is, broadly speaking, to use solutions of partial differential equations which are geometric in origin to study properties of differentiable manifolds. The main areas of concentration of the PI's research are the desingularization of Einstein orbifolds, the construction of sequences of collapsing Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces, the construction of a global moduli space of scalar-flat Kahler ALE metrics, and the study of the orbifold Yamabe problem. In joint work with Morteza, an existence theorem for Einstein metrics was proved in the asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein setting, which generalized a result of Biquard in dimension four, and the PI proposes several extensions and generalizations of this work. In ongoing work with Hein, Sun, and Zhang, the PI has constructed new examples of Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces which collapse to an interval, with Heisenberg nilmanifolds occurring as fibers in the regular collapsing regions. There are many interesting questions resulting from this work, especially to relate these degenerations to polarized degenerations of K3 surfaces.  In joint work with Han, the PI proposes a plan towards constructing a global moduli space of scalar-flat Kahler ALE metrics for certain groups at infinity. Also, in joint work with Tao Ju, the PI has proved some nonexistence results for the orbifold Yamabe problem, and plans to generalize this further. Finally, the PI is committed to integrating research and education and cultivating intellectual development on many levels.

Indeed, Einstein wrote his famous field equations in the language of tensors on manifolds, and these equations have since been well studied by mathematicians and physicists alike.  Certainly, besides being fundamental in general relativity, differential geometry is  also very useful in other fields of science, such as in control theory,  in computer vision, data analysis, and many others. For this reason, understanding the structure of manifolds is a fundamental problem in science. This project will focus on the behavior of geometric flows on manifolds. A typical example of a geometric flow is the heat equation, which describes the distribution of heat in a region over time.  This proposal studies a more advanced form of the heat equation, called the Ricci flow. A Riemannian metric on a manifold tells us about the shape of that object, how to measure angles and distances. The Ricci flow is a heat-type equation for Riemannian metrics. It is hoped, and confirmed in some cases, that the Ricci flow will evolve a given metric on a manifold to an improved one, such as an Einstein metric. However, a major difference between this theory and that of the standard heat equation is that the Ricci flow is a non-linear equation, and as such it usually develops singularities after some time. When such singularities are understood, the process may be continued. This has played a central role in the proof of the long-standing Poincare conjecture about the topology of three dimensional manifolds.  The main goal of this project is to understand such singularities in dimension four, and to investigate the implications of our findings to the structure of four dimensional manifolds.  Because Ricci flow can be seen as the renormalization group flow in string theory, there are other possible applications of this study to theoretical physics. Other related flows, like the mean curvature flow, have further remarkable applications to other fields, such as in computer visualization, for eliminating noise, or in metallurgy, for heat treatment of metals. The outreach components of this project disseminate the results to general public and contribute to the development of young talent.<br/><br/>Ricci flow was introduced by Richard Hamilton in the early eighties, in a fundamental work devoted to understanding positively curved three dimensional manifolds. It became clear later that if one flows an arbitrary metric on a given manifold, the flow will generally develop singularities. One needs to understand these singularities in order to continue the flow, and to not lose any significant topological information about the space. The singularities of Ricci flow are modeled by Ricci solitons, which are fixed points of the flow, modulo diffeomorphisms and scaling. Three-dimensional shrinking Ricci solitons have been classified through the work of Hamilton, Ivey and Perelman. This has important consequences to understanding the behavior of Ricci flow with surgeries on three-dimensional manifolds, and indeed, for the resolution of the Poincare conjecture. The main goal of this project is to classify four-dimensional complete noncompact Ricci solitons. This will be achieved through a complete understanding of the asymptotic geometry of these spaces and through studying corresponding rigidity questions. It is expected that this project will advance our insight on the behavior of Ricci flow in dimension four, which will enable a Ricci flow approach to some important questions about the topology of four dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moduli spaces may parameterize a wide variety of objects, from physical particles, to geometric shapes, to solutions of differential equations. They are important not only because they carry information about the objects they parameterize, but also because they represent naturally occurring examples of interesting geometries. There are several well-known families of moduli spaces which carry a so-called hyperKahler geometry, based on the algebra of quaternions, and physical considerations suggest that these moduli spaces may have certain strong properties reflected in their global shape, or topology. A principal goal of this project is to develop analytical tools to establish these properties and more deeply understand the geometry of these spaces and their relatives. This work has significant interdisciplinary appeal as it makes contact with several different areas of analysis, geometry and topology, and provides a testing ground for certain duality principles in physics. Additional impacts of the project include the facilitation of the PI's educational activities, including the supervising of original undergraduate research, mentoring student-led project-based independent study projects, and an ongoing initiative to improve diversity and gender parity in the mathematics program at New College of Florida.<br/><br/>This project will develop a framework for the analysis of elliptic operators on a class of spaces which includes several families of hyperKahler moduli spaces of interest in physics and geometry. These are exemplified by the moduli spaces of magnetic monopoles, the L2 cohomology of which is the subject of a long standing and still open conjecture of Ashoke Sen coming from supersymmetric physics. This seminal conjecture spawned several parallel conjectures about similar moduli spaces, and is the starting point for a number interesting geometric questions motivated by physics. A principal tool this project will develop is a generalization of Mazzeo and Melrose's well-known calculus of pseudodifferential operators on manifolds with ""fibered boundary"", to a category of compact manifolds with ""quasi-fibered boundary"". This is a category in which the monopole moduli spaces and other families of hyperKahler moduli spaces admit natural compactifications, the construction of which is a second major goal of this project. Beginning with a proof of Sen's conjecture, this work will therefore make refined techniques of geometric microlocal analysis newly available to the study of these important classes of spaces in hyperKahler geometry and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Einstein's theory of general relativity describes how the spacetime is curved by gravitation. The language of his theory is geometry and the phenomenon is governed by his eponymous equation. There have been great advances in both theoretical and experimental aspects of general relativity, for example the recent detection of gravitational waves by LIGO. However, due to the complexity of Einstein's equation, most of our knowledge of the universe are global and large scale, such as the observation of an astrophysical event from a very faraway distance. Recently, the PI and his collaborators applied the tools of geometry and differential equations to give the most precise measurement of gravitational energy and mass on any finitely extended region of the universe. This is essential in understanding the fine and local structure of our universe, with applications in, for example, GPS technology and space exploration. It is also crucial in studying non-isolated large-scale phenomena such as black hole mergers and collisions. The success of this project will deepen our understanding of gravitational energy/mass and the nonlinear local/global nature of the spacetime. The PI also plans to study geometric flows, which are differential equations that model how a geometric shape deforms and evolves to an optimal form in the most efficient way.

In particular, the quasilocal mass definition the PI discovered with Yau will be a key ingredient in this research. Immediate goals include proving the general invariant mass conjecture, establishing a positive mass theorem for the Robinson-Trautman spacetime and the linear stability of higher dimensional Schwarzschild spacetimes, and the solution of a conjecture of Arnol'd by the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. This research project will also advance our understanding of nonlinear partial differential systems such as the optimal isometric embedding equation, the mean curvature flow, and the Einstein equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our perception of such objects, either with our eyes, or through the results of scanners, is determined by their shapes, which are themselves characterized by the geometry of their surfaces.  We are currently experiencing an explosion of discrete geometric data on shapes of objects obtained from scanners, cameras, imaging systems, sensors, satellites, and even cell phones. There is an urgent need for this geometric data to be processed automatically, for shape matching, shape comparison, and shape recognition. This need arises in areas such as facial recognition, identifying and classifying fossilized bones, distinguishing fractures in bones, diagnosing tumors and anomalies in organs, and measuring changes over time in brain images.  Creating a mathematical theory and developing algorithms to recognize and to align such geometric shapes are therefore major research challenges that have far-reaching implications. Deep mathematical theories in geometry and analysis that were developed over the past centuries are now finding applications in this field of shape matching. This project explores fundamental issues in this exciting area, which is on the cusp of seeing major advances. It does so by using the theory of conformal, harmonic, and isometric mappings to align surfaces. While these theories have been extensively studied in a mathematical context, their adaptation to computational algorithms is still under development. This project develops a cohesive and comprehensive theoretical framework for this emerging discipline along with concrete connections to scientific applications. It plans to implement and make publicly available a collection of software that will offer new tools and will open new lines of inquiry to scientists in biology, medicine, anthropology and other fields where the analysis of shape plays a central role.<br/><br/>The surfaces in our three-dimensional world can be described mathematically as two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Study of the geometric structures on such surfaces is a central topic in mathematical areas such as topology and differential geometry. It leads to classical theories of conformal geometry, moduli spaces, harmonic and conformal maps, and Riemann surfaces. These fields are now being applied to study surfaces of bones, brain cortices, proteins and other bio-molecules. When viewing an object with a laser, or radar, or CAT scan, we obtain a discrete representation of such a surface. Classical theories are inadequate for processing this real world data. This project will develop discrete counterparts of conformal and harmonic maps of surfaces, explore their existence, uniqueness, and diffeomorphism properties, and establish the convergence of the discrete theory to the classical smooth theory. It will also create and implement algorithms that incorporate this theory to create usable software for scientists and other practitioners. In this way, this project will bridge the gap between the mathematical theories of geometry and topology and the application of such ideas to algorithmic analysis of shape data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington.<br/><br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and early career researchers. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.

The four color map theorem was first proved in 1976 by Appel and Haken; the proof involved a huge amount of case checking, so much so that the only feasible method of attack was via computer.  This machine-assisted proof, however, cannot be directly checked by a human.  Although there have been some subsequent simplifications and clarifications, the general brute-force approach has seemed to be the only line of attack.  The four color theorem can be rephrased, though, as a question about the topology of three-dimensional manifolds, and in particular new tools inspired by high energy physics give novel ways to approach a conceptual proof of the four color theorem.  This project explores and develops these new insights.<br/><br/>The principal investigator and collaborator define a version of instanton Floer homology for trivalent graphs embedded in three-manifolds. This theory enables them to place the four color map theorem firmly in the context of gauge-theory-inspired invariants of three-manifolds. They have proved a fundamental non-vanishing theorem for this Floer homology group, reducing the four color map theorem to a question about computing this invariant for general planar graphs.  They are developing new tools for the computation of these and related invariants, and they have discovered a spectral sequence relevant to this computation.

Ever since Einstein's theory of general relativity, it was understood that there is a very close link between the physics and the geometry of the universe. However, most recent physical theories, such as superstring theory and M-theory, show that the physical properties of 4-dimensional spacetime may be described in terms of the geometry of hidden six- or seven-dimensional spaces. In this project, the PI will study the properties of a particular kind of seven-dimensional spaces which appear in these theories, known as manifolds with a G2-structure.  The main goal of this project is to further develop the theory of deformations or `flows' of G2-structures which will effect smooth transitions between different classes of G2-structures.  The PI anticipates that this will pave the way towards giving sufficient conditions for existence of torsion-free G2-structures, which is one of the most significant open problems in differential geometry. (A G2-structure defines, at each point of the manifold, a `dot product' of vectors -- a way of multiplying two vectors to get a scalar -- as well as a `cross product' that allows one to multiply two vectors to produce a third vector.  Torsion-free G2-structures are those for which these dot and cross products are maximally compatible.)  As part of the project, the PI will train undergraduate research assistants and will involve them in the activities of the Experimental Algebra & Geometry Lab, of which the PI is a co-director. The lab's activities will combine training, mentoring, research, and outreach to promote mathematics at various levels -- starting at K-12, the broader community, and going all the way to graduate level.<br/><br/>In his prior work, the PI introduced the modified Laplacian coflow of co-closed G2-structures that rectified the non-parabolicity of the standard Laplacian coflow. The PI also introduced a description of G2-structures in terms of octonion bundles that interpreted the torsion of a G2-structure as an octonionic connection and the choice of a G2-structure within the same metric class as a choice of gauge. G2-structures with divergence-free torsion were then interpreted as critical points of an energy functional and as an analogue of the Coulomb gauge. This project builds upon this prior work. The main goal is to prove existence properties for the standard Laplacian coflow. This will be accomplished by first proving the existence of G2-structures with divergence-free torsion within a fixed metric class using harmonic map techniques. This will then be used as a gauge-fixing condition for the Laplacian coflow, which will relate it to the modified coflow for which existence is known. The second objective of this project is to study and construct other significant flows of G2-structures, with the aim of proving existence and stability under appropriate conditions and analyzing the behavior of these flows on homogeneous manifolds. The third objective of this project is to study the properties of octonion-bundle-valued differential forms and to obtain an octonion-valued analogue of Dolbeault cohomology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classical examples are minimal surfaces, which locally minimize area subject to fixed boundary conditions, such as soap films supported by wires of various shapes. This project studies constant mean curvature (CMC) and minimal surfaces as well as harmonic maps. CMC surfaces optimize area, but with constraint given by enclosed volume -- CMC surfaces appear in nature as soap bubbles. Harmonic maps optimize energy rather than area and are closely related to minimal surfaces. The objects studied in this project have characterizations in many branches of mathematics; the questions and desired results are of broad interest in mathematics and beyond.<br/><br/>This research project primarily studies CMC surfaces immersed in smooth manifolds and harmonic maps into metric spaces. In the work on harmonic maps, the project aims to provide a new direction for resolution of Cannon's conjecture. It is planned to establish the existence of a harmonic homeomorphism from the round unit sphere into a sphere with a metric possessing upper curvature bounds. In a second direction, the project aims to refine techniques that produced a compactness theory for harmonic maps into metric spaces with upper curvature bounds. While the techniques for proving compactness in this setting are necessarily geometric and variational (rather than analytic), the results are analogous to those that establish compactness in the smooth setting. Using the refined techniques, the investigator plans to establish a harmonic replacement argument using energy rather than modulus of continuity methods. Other research directions relate to the study of CMC surfaces. The investigator plans to extend and refine a gluing construction that produced CMC hypersurfaces in Euclidean space.

It centers around questions about the structures and symmetries of a symplectic manifold--an even-dimensional space that locally looks like the phase space containing the position and momentum of a moving particle.  Modern physics has led to the discoveries of many important and sophisticated invariants of symplectic manifolds, and has predicted a number of deep connections to different fields of mathematics. Current definitions and approaches to these invariants are based on the analysis of a special kind of mapping of a surface to a symplectic manifold, known as the theory of holomorphic curves. The primary goal of the project is to develop an alternative approach to some of these invariants, which is more accessible and which will form the foundations of effective calculations. The approach is based on the microlocal sheaf theory, which was invented as an algebraic and topological method to study differential equations. The project will have many applications in the field of representation theory, a rich subject focusing on the study of symmetries appearing in mathematics and physics. The PI will also continue to organize seminars on related topics, disseminate her results through academic events, and provide research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will use microlocal sheaf theory to quantize Lagrangian submanifolds in an exact symplectic manifold, and will give the definition of a microlocal sheaf category of a symplectic manifold, which is expected to be equivalent to the important symplectic invariant, known as the Fukaya category.  The approach is purely topological, and it allows the coefficient ring to be a ring spectrum, which opens up interesting connections to stable homotopy theory. The PI will develop a parallel story in the complex setting of holomorphic Lagrangians in an exact holomorphic symplectic manifold, which exhibits new and richer structures and which will have important applications in geometric representation theory. The PI will use this to quantize holomorphic Lagrangians in symplectic resolutions, a class of holomorphic symplectic manifolds in the center of modern representation theory, with the goal of understanding the mysterious phenomena of symplectic duality. Other applications to representation theory involve calculations in the Hecke category using sheaf quantizations of the braid group action as symplectomorphisms and a proposal to realize the nonabelian Hodge theory using microlocal perverse sheaves."

One area of investigation is energy-minimizing mappings between curved spaces (known as nonlinear harmonic maps) and their singular sets, i.e., points where the mapping ceases to be smooth. Another area of investigation is the structure of the spaces that arise as limits of smooth spaces with bounded curvature, and a third area is the regularity of solutions to the Yang-Mills equations which arise particle physics. The research project also touches on other mathematical subjects such as Reifenberg analysis, spectral analysis, stochastic analysis and metric-measure spaces. In each area, open problems which are at the forefront of the topic are being pursued. These are topics which have broad applications to many areas of mathematics and physics, and solutions to these problems would open doors to tackling the next generation of problems. Many parts of this project also involve the training of early-career researchers, as several lines of investigation involve collaboration with senior graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>The first part of this overall project is concerned with the energy identity and the W2,1-conjecture for nonlinear harmonic maps. Roughly, the energy identity is a conjectural picture which gives an explicit formula for the blow-up behavior of sequences of nonlinear harmonic maps. The W2,1-conjecture is the easily stated conjecture that stationary harmonic maps have a priori L1 estimates for their hessians. Valtorta and the PI have solved these conjectures for stationary Yang-Mills, but the methods do not work for harmonic maps, and the PI will solve the problems by other means. In another line of investigation, joint with Yu Wang, the PI will answer some open questions by Hardt and Lin on nonlinear harmonic maps. Roughly, the goal is show one can solve for stable harmonic maps in the class of strongly H1-mappings. The second part of the proposal would address issues involving the regularity of spaces with lower and bounded Ricci curvature. Together with Wenshuai Jiang the first project of this part would study the energy identity for limits of manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. Though similar in spirit, the problem itself is actually very different from the harmonic map case. To begin with, the energy in this context is the L2 curvature form, and it has only been very recently that one even knows this is a bounded measure. Secondly, the predicted form of the defect measure in this context can be computed by the singularity behavior in the limit. Additionally, with Bob Haslhofer, the PI will study connections between bounded Ricci curvature and the analysis on path space. The PI will prove differential Harnack estimates for martingales on spaces with two sided Ricci curvature bounds. The solution to each of these problems involve the development of new techniques and ideas, which themselves one would expect to be even more interesting than the problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world such as angles, distances and properties of certain shapes. Differential geometry was developed to use the tools of calculus to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity, or the properties of soap bubbles (which turn out to be related to the equations describing black holes). In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations.  The research in this project involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study.   In addition to mathematical investigations, the PI will be organizing a summer residential STEM program in cooperation with the Chicago Pre-College Science and Engineering Program, and supported by the Notre Dame TRiO Program.  This will be a two-week program run in the summers of 2019 and 2020 for high school students from Chicago Public Schools, many of whom will be first-generation college students.  The program will run for two weeks, and will include mathematics instruction and project-based learning <br/> <br/>There are two main mathematical themes supported by this award. Poincare-Einstein manifolds are generalizations of the Poincare ball model of hyperbolic space.  They are complete manifolds satisfying the Einstein condition (with negative Einstein constant) which can be compactified by conformally changing the metric that vanishes at an appropriate rate at infinity.  They arise in several areas of mathematics and theoretical physics; for example, in in the Fefferman-Graham theory of conformal invariants and in the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. One area of investigation supported by this award is the fundamental question of existence:  given a manifold with boundary and a conformal class of metrics on the boundary, can one construct a Poincare-Einstein metric whose compactification induces the given conformal class on the boundary?  In joint work with Q. Han and S. Stolz, the PI is developing new tools to detect obstructions to existence based on the topology and geometry of the boundary. On the other hand, in work with G. Szekelyhidi the PI was able to prove local existence of solutions (i.e., in a neighborhood of infinity). Another area of research with connections to physics is the PI's ongoing work with J. Streets and C. Kelleher on the variational properties of the Yang-Mills functional in four dimensions.  Building on the recent work, which gave a new sharp lower bound for minimizing solutions, the PI will investigate the behavior of solutions with large Morse index.  The PI will prove a lower bound for the energy depending (in a precise way) on the index of the solution and the geometry of the base manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, the modeling of a wide class of physical phenomena, such as crystal growth and flame propagation, involves tracking fronts that move with curvature-dependent speed. When a surface evolves with speed that is proportional to the curvature, this results in one of the classic degenerate nonlinear differential equations called the mean curvature flow.  For nonlinear equations like this, it is possible that solutions may develop sharp points and corners, so it is natural to ask ""what is the regularity of solutions?''  Optimal regularity for mean curvature flow was recently proven by the PI and Minicozzi.  The proof weaves together analysis and geometry. It is expected that many of the new ingredients and techniques should lead to many other results for a wide range of equations that the PI will investigate in this project.<br/><br/>This project has two parts. The main part concerns geometric evolution equations, like mean curvature flow (MCF) and Ricci flow. It deals with optimal regularity and applications.

However, there remains  a large class of open problems where holomorphic curve techniques seems not to be sufficient for proving expected results. The current project attempts to develop alternative techniques, or in case they do not exist to develop new methods of  construction  which could show that everything which is not prohibited by holomorphic curve techniques  can indeed happen.

Building on recent developments, both on the rigid and flexible side of symplectic topology of Weinstein manifolds,  the  project is designed to advance several central problems of the theory, such as symplectic topology of Lagrangian submanifolds.  Among the  main objectives of the project are: exploration of  techniques for simplification of singularities of Lagrangian skeleta of Weinstein manifolds, and in particular for  proving exploration of methods for attacking the regularity conjecture for exact Lagrangian submanifolds of Weinstein manifolds; exploration of  a new approach to singularity theory: h-principle without pre-conditions; further exploration of flexibility phenomena  for Weinstein manifolds and their Lagrangian submanifolds; and further development of Symplectic Field Theory. The project is designed to bridge the gap between the negative results establishing limits for possible symplectic constructions, and positive results involving the advanced symplectic constructions on the frontier of possibilities. The new methods  developed for the arborealization project may find applications elsewhere in singularity theory. The work on the project will involve several graduate students and postdocs and there will be written a graduate student level book devoted to new advances in symplectic flexibility.  The obtained results and developed methods may find applications in other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our perception of such objects, either with our eyes, or through the results of scanners, is determined by their shapes, which are themselves characterized by the geometry of their surfaces.  We are currently experiencing an explosion of discrete geometric data on shapes of objects obtained from scanners, cameras, imaging systems, sensors, satellites, and even cell phones. There is an urgent need for this geometric data to be processed automatically, for shape matching, shape comparison, and shape recognition. This need arises in areas such as facial recognition, identifying and classifying fossilized bones, distinguishing fractures in bones, diagnosing tumors and anomalies in organs, and measuring changes over time in brain images.  Creating a mathematical theory and developing algorithms to recognize and to align such geometric shapes are therefore major research challenges that have far-reaching implications. Deep mathematical theories in geometry and analysis that were developed over the past centuries are now finding applications in this field of shape matching. This project explores fundamental issues in this exciting area, which is on the cusp of seeing major advances. It does so by using the theory of conformal, harmonic, and isometric mappings to align surfaces. While these theories have been extensively studied in a mathematical context, their adaptation to computational algorithms is still under development. This project develops a cohesive and comprehensive theoretical framework for this emerging discipline along with concrete connections to scientific applications. It plans to implement and make publicly available a collection of software that will offer new tools and will open new lines of inquiry to scientists in biology, medicine, anthropology and other fields where the analysis of shape plays a central role.<br/><br/>The surfaces in our three-dimensional world can be described mathematically as two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Study of the geometric structures on such surfaces is a central topic in mathematical areas such as topology and differential geometry. It leads to classical theories of conformal geometry, moduli spaces, harmonic and conformal maps, and Riemann surfaces. These fields are now being applied to study surfaces of bones, brain cortices, proteins and other bio-molecules. When viewing an object with a laser, or radar, or CAT scan, we obtain a discrete representation of such a surface. Classical theories are inadequate for processing this real world data. This project will develop discrete counterparts of conformal and harmonic maps of surfaces, explore their existence, uniqueness, and diffeomorphism properties, and establish the convergence of the discrete theory to the classical smooth theory. It will also create and implement algorithms that incorporate this theory to create usable software for scientists and other practitioners. In this way, this project will bridge the gap between the mathematical theories of geometry and topology and the application of such ideas to algorithmic analysis of shape data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their long history, many of these questions remained inaccessible until a series of breakthroughs in the late twentieth century that culminated in the development of Gromov-Witten theory.  The key new ideas were that problems of enumerative geometry are best interpreted in terms of intersection theory on a moduli space, and that insights from the physics of string theory reveal elegant patterns in families of enumerations that were previously unobserved by the mathematics community.  The PI's research program involves developing the intersection theory of a particularly fundamental moduli space - the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of curves - as well as producing rigorous mathematical frameworks for some of the correspondences between theories that physicists have predicted.<br/><br/>A major part of this research program is devoted to studying the Chow ring of the moduli space of curves.  Although a full picture of the Chow ring of this space currently seems out of reach, there is a subring known as the ""tautological ring"" that contains nearly every geometrically-interesting class yet that admits an explicit, finite set of additive generators.  The PI has been an active contributor to the study of the relations among these generators, in joint work with Felix Janda (University of Michigan), Sam Grushevsky (Stony Brook University), and Dmitry Zakharov (Central Michigan University).  In forthcoming work, she plans to develop tautological intersection theory both computationally (producing algorithms for calculating certain desirable expressions for tautological classes in terms of the generators) and theoretically (seeking new tautological expressions for classes such as the hyperelliptic locus).  Much of this work will be carried out in collaboration with student researchers. A second central component of the PI's research is the mathematical proof and extension of equivalences proposed by physics.  For example, in joint work with Felix Janda and Yongbin Ruan (University of Michigan), she has proven a wall-crossing formula relating Gromov-Witten theory to the theory of quasimaps, a relationship that is closely related to the famous physical phenomenon known as mirror symmetry.  In future work, she will extend this wall-crossing formula to new cases and use it to attack another physical conjecture: the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence.  She will also work, in collaboration with Alexandr Buryak (University of Leeds) and Ran Tessler (ETH Zurich), toward the theoretical development of a version of r-spin theory for curves with boundary, with an ultimate goal of generalizing Witten's r-spin conjecture to that setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is about the Einstein flow, which deforms such slices in a way that, when the slices are stacked up, the result is 4-dimensional solution of the vacuum Einstein equations, the fundamental equations that govern our universe.  Deducing something about the future (or past) state of the universe from information about the present is of evident interest in cosmology, and pose a very challenging mathematical problem. In this project, the investigator will focus on the asymptotic (or long-term) behavior of spacetimes, in the ""cosmological"" setting where the slices are compact (i.e., they wrap back on themselves, like the surface of a balloon, no matter how large their size). In this context, even if the spacetime does not develop singularities (e.g., a black hole), the spatial slices can asymptotically collapse, meaning that their volumes become smaller than a naive rescaling argument would suggest. Recently, the investigator adapted techniques from Riemannian geometry (and in particular the study of collapsing solutions of the Ricci flow) to give new information about expanding vacuum spacetimes. Part of this project will be to build on these results and obtain more precise results about the future asymptotics of these spacetimes. Another component of this project will be the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. Results of this project will also be disseminated to the public via journal publications, conferences, and posting to online mathematics archives.<br/><br/>Collapsing in differential geometry is the phenomenon that a sequence of Riemannian manifolds can converge to a lower dimensional space in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. The research in this proposal will extend collapsing methods, both within differential geometry and within geometric flows. In recent work, the investigator adapted collapsing techniques to give new information about the future asymptotics of expanding Einstein flows. One feature was the avoidance of any a priori symmetry assumptions; instead, continuous symmetries appeared in the collapsing limit. The proposed research will extend this in various ways. One direction is a more concrete understanding of the asymptotics of expanding vacuum solutions. A second direction is the asymptotics of shrinking Einstein flows, which are relevant for spacetime singularities. In addition, the investigator will work on problems in differential geometry and geometric flows such as collapsing with a lower bound on the curvature operator, and the behavior of scalar curvature lower bounds under metric convergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects called varieties, created by equations that are built from addition and multiplication. Symplectic geometry involves geometric objects related to classical mechanics. We are interested in `topological' properties of some of these varieties such as how many `holes' they have and `enumerative' properties such as the number of curves they contain. The PI is interested in pairs of varieties which are birational to each other, which means that they become identical after removing smaller varieties. We wish to know what topological or enumerative properties they have in common. One of the main aims of this project is to see how tools from symplectic geometry can be used to investigate such issues. The PI believes these ideas are new and can be used to explore other areas of algebraic and symplectic geometry using this different perspective. The PI will help out with a program involving high school students called Seawolf math, and will also help out with a math summer camp for high school students at Stony Brook. The PI will also help out in workshops designed for graduate students learning closely related fields of study.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to understand the relationship between birational geometry and certain Floer theoretic invariants.  These invariants include symplectic/contact cohomology, Floer cohomology of a symplectomorphism and the Fukaya category. The PI will use these Floer invariants to prove certain statements related to birational geometry.  One of the main goals of this NSF funded project is to give a completely new approach to the crepant resolution conjecture using an extended version of symplectic cohomology. The PI will prove a weak version of this conjecture using these methods. The PI believes these methods point to certain generalizations of this conjecture. The PI will study terminal 3-fold singularities and also Newton non-degenerate singularities using Floer theory. Studying such singularities could lead to new insights just as studying quotient singularities led the PI to study the crepant resolution conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The idea is that new and powerful computing tools will provide insight that was not available to earlier generations of mathematicians.  One such question, known as Thomson's problem, asks how some number of electrons will arrange themselves on the sphere so as to minimize their total potential energy.  Such a problem has wide-ranging applications because in many scientific fields it is quite useful to know how to evenly distribute points or sensors or energy sources in a space.  The principal investigator recently resolved a large part of the story for the case of five points on the sphere and plans to continue to develop this theory.  Another problem asks about the stability of the solar system in a highly simplified model of celestial mechanics called outer billiards.  It is known that there exist initial conditions for which the corresponding orbits are unbounded; this project aims to further develop a theory that provides detailed theoretical pictures of these orbits in a special case.  Another problem under investigation in the project is the famous square peg problem, which asks if every loop in the plane has four points on it that make the corners of a square.  <br/><br/>In technical terms, the project focuses on the following areas.  First, it is planned to extend results related to a phase-transition conjecture for the 5-electron problem.  The principal investigator proved that there exists a constant c such that the triangular bi-pyramid is the energy minimizer for the Riesz s-potential if and only if s is not greater than c.  It is conjectured that some pyramid with square base is the energy minimizer for the Riesz s-potential if and only if s is not less than c. Second, the project aims to continue developing the plaid mode, a combinatorial construction that assigns to each rational number a collection of polyhedral surfaces contained in a cube.  When the model is sliced in one coordinate direction, it gives loops which accurately model certain orbits of outer billiards with respect to the kite with the same parameter.  When the model is sliced in the other two coordinate directions it gives loops that are combinatorially isomorphic to those found in Truchet tilings and in corner percolation.  Third, the principal investigator plans to continue an ongoing study of the space of inscribed rectangles in a Jordan loop.  He has established that every Jordan loop has associated to it a connected set of rectangles such that every point of the loop, with at most 4 exceptional points, is the vertex of one of the rectangles in the set.  This result leads to a question of how a rectangle can slide continuously along a pair of arcs, a problem akin to studying the solutions of a differential equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes these spaces exist as physical objects such as the surface of planet or a cell, or the universe itself; sometimes they appear as abstract spaces in applied situations, such as the set of all possible states of a physical system, the set of possible configurations of a machine, or the set of strategies of a group of players in the stock market. In these situations, it is often important to find and study the properties of objects inside these spaces that are optimal in some sense: for example, the shortest way to move between two configurations, or the surface that minimizes area or surface tension. Sometimes these geometric sub-objects come in families (e.g., foliations that slice the space into thin pieces), and it is important to study not just each of these pieces by itself, but the whole family as a unique entity. This project will study several instances of these important and very natural objects, and draw new bridges between these geometric concepts and other more abstract areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is to study certain structures of Riemannian manifolds such as singular Riemannian foliations and closed minimal submanifolds, and relate them to the geometry and topology of the ambient space. In the study of singular Riemannian foliations, the main focus will be on laying new theoretical ground (e.g., continuing the development of an invariant theory in this context) and applying these concepts in different areas, such as producing new manifolds with positive and non-negative curvature, or exhibiting new immersed minimal hypersurfaces in round spheres and projective spaces. In the study of closed minimal submanifolds, the main focus will be on the index of such objects, especially in the two extreme cases of closed geodesics and minimal hypersurfaces. The PI will continue working on a conjecture of Berger on manifolds with all geodesics closed, and on a conjecture of Marques-Neves-Schoen on minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. In the first case, the plan is to improve the understanding of the equivariant Morse theory on the free loop space of spaces with all geodesics closed.

These objects play a central role in general relativity where gravitation is reflected by the curvature of space-time. Geometric objects can often be improved if we evolve them by a differential equation, so that the curvature dissipates in a way analogous to heat dissipation. However, one important difference is that, while heat dissipation is a linear phenomenon, all the geometrically interesting equations are nonlinear. This project is aimed at understanding these nonlinear phenomena. Of particular interest is the process of singularity formation: That is to say, what happens when a surface is about to break apart and the curvature becomes very large? Understanding these questions is an important problem within mathematics. In addition, discrete versions of these equations are used in engineering and computer science.<br/><br/>The most important example of a geometric evolution equation is Hamilton's Ricci flow, which is a key tool in Perelman's proof of the Poincare and Geometrization conjectures, as well as in the proof of the Sphere Theorem.

One of the main concept is that of an ancient solutions. Ancient solutions are solutions which can be extended infinitely far backward in time. They often arise as models for a solution to a geometric flow right before a singularity forms. As such, they play an important role in understanding singularity formation. One of the goals here is to classify all ancient solutions in low dimensions, subject to a noncollapsing assumption. This is analogous to the problem of classifying entire solutions to elliptic equations.

The equations of motion in classical mechanics are determined by the notion of a conserved quantity, energy.  A related quantity is action, which is minimized by solutions to the equations of motion.  For a closed system, such as the Kepler problem whose solutions describe paths of planets orbiting the sun,  the energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy in the system, and the action is given by the (minimized) mean value of kinetic minus potential energy.  Symplectic and contact structures emerge as we investigate these systems by unpacking the information hidden in the notions of energy and action.  Understanding the evolution and distinguishing transformations of these systems led to the development of global invariants of symplectic and contact manifolds.  <br/><br/>The PI plans to continue her work in providing foundations and applications for contact invariants stemming from nonequivariant and (circle) equivariant constructions of contact homology. Contact homology is built out of closed orbits of Reeb vector fields and counts of solutions to a nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation which interpolates between closed Reeb orbits. Reeb vector fields are Hamiltonian-like vector fields, whose flow lines are solutions to Hamilton's equations of motion, as they conserve energy. Closed Reeb orbits are of particular interest because they can be used to describe the motion of a planet orbiting a star, the closed trajectories of a satellite, and other local distance minimizing ""loops."" Contact homology can be used to better distinguish contact structures on a given smooth manifold and to extract dynamical information pertaining to the possible Reeb vector fields which can be associated to a fixed contact structure. The PI's work has shown that these invariants capture more phenomena than previously expected. She also plans to study additional structural properties of these contact and related symplectic invariants, Legendrian knots in closed contact manifolds, dynamics of Seifert fiber spaces, and symplectic embeddings.

This study of curvature is important in all domains of science and engineering. For example, the theory of general relativity posits that gravity curves space and time in a mathematically precise manner, while in materials science, the meeting points between crystal structures are modeled by (a rather different notion of) curvature. This project is concerned with the study of a particular measure of bending called scalar curvature. Scalar curvature is one of the simplest measures of bending, but due to this simplicity scalar curvature can contain only a limited amount of information. Hence, we must study scalar curvature through highly indirect means. One way to explore scalar curvature is in relation to the isoperimetric problem: in a given space, how can we enclose the largest amount of volume with the smallest perimeter? This is one of the oldest mathematical questions, but its link to scalar curvature is only recently beginning to be understood. The PI's project will continue the study of scalar curvature as it affects the large-scale behavior of area and volume, with particular emphasis on the relationship between such topics and problems related to general relativity. In addition to this research, this project will also support the PI's continued efforts to promote student learning and training through seminar organization, conferences, and summer schools, as well as expository articles and notes.  <br/><br/>A major component of the research plan is the continued study of the link between large-scale variational problems and scalar curvature, motivated by geometric and physical considerations such as the Penrose inequality and static uniqueness questions from general relativity. To this end, the PI plans to continue his investigation of global uniqueness questions related to scalar curvature and the isoperimetric problem. Recently, several such problems have been understood in three dimensions, using a combination of powerful tools from geometric analysis (many of which are limited to three dimensions). One portion of the research will consist of investigating higher dimensional analogues of these results, which will necessitate the development of a wide array of new techniques. The ideas developed in these aforementioned global uniqueness works have also led to other (a priori unrelated) topics that the PI will investigate. For example, determining the validity of the Minkowski inequality for non-convex surfaces (possibly with an additional bending term) is related to the uniqueness question for large stable constant mean curvature surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds. Similarly, an invariant related to the least area in the homology class of a torus for certain Riemannian three-manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature is related to the rigidity of area-minimizing cylinders in three-manifolds of non-negative scalar curvature. In a different (but related) direction, this project will also include investigation of the relationship between the geometry and topology of minimal surfaces, including the study of surfaces with simple topology or small index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smooth ones have been studied effectively by the calculus, while singular geometric shapes are much more difficult to study in general although they appear with abundance in the world around us. One method to understand singular shapes is by measuring distances between their points. To do that, the best way is to use the so-called Einstein structures, which originate from general relativity. In this project, the investigator plans to study Einstein structures on a class of geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, which are central objects in many branches of mathematics. This study will allow us to measure distances and reveal certain mysterious structures of algebraic varieties. This project requires combinations of many techniques and will bring experts from different fields to interact. Its outcome will have potential applications in the development of several theories, including canonical metrics in differential geometry, stability theory in algebraic geometry, and string theory in mathematical physics.<br/><br/>The investigator will study the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture about the equivalence of K-stability and the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on singular Fano varieties. This requires new strategies to overcome difficulties due to the presence of singularities. The investigator has introduced a new process, the minimization of normalized volumes, for detecting local geometries of algebraic singularities. On the algebraic side, the investigator will continue his research on the K-stability of Fano varieties by studying minimization of normalized volumes and applying deep techniques of the minimal model program from algebraic geometry. This could lead to new criteria for the K-stability of singular varieties. On the analytic side, the investigator will apply various newly-developed techniques, including a variational approach via pluripotential theory, a priori estimates for singular complex Monge-Ampere equations, Cheeger-Colding-Tian's regularity theory from metric geometry, algebraic structures on Gromov-Hausdorff limits, and asymptotical analysis of singular metrics.

Sometimes different combinations of symmetries might have the same overall effect, leading to ""relations"".  Abstractly, a group may be specified with a finite list of ""generators"" and relations among the generators, collectively called a presentation.  An important question in mathematics is whether two presentations define the same or similar groups.  Geometric group theory seeks to use geometric tools to differentiate groups, and to study their large-scale features.

This flexibility is important for the role it plays in other areas in being able to deal with somewhat noisy or imprecise data, and reason rigorously about it.  For many purposes, however, one wants to know how large or complex topological constructions are, and how stable solutions are to perturbations.  This requires, technically, that one studies not just nonlinear functions from one space to another, but also spaces that bound measurements (such as the size of derivatives) on the functions.  This mixed analytic topological study will be at the core of the project, with applications to geometric complexity, to spaces with singularities, which benefit from such study, but also require additional geometric and algebraic tools. Application to problems of numerical computation with natural resource bounds is anticipated<br/><br/>In more detail, this project will study the complexity measured in terms of Lipschitz constants and bi-Lipschitz constants of homotopies, embeddings, immersions and (volumes for) cobordisms in smooth and PL settings.  In some sense this should have the same relation to usual geometric topology as theoretical computer science has to logic. Indeed, using undecidability results, one can prove lower complexity bounds (as in Nabutovsky's ICM talk), but much homotopy theory, especially stable homotopy theory are decidable, but not effectively so (following Brown). The new information can be thought of as providing geometric information about function spaces of Lipschitz maps, showing that they have some bounds on diameter that are quite striking in comparison to the much larger estimates (that underly approximation theory, and some learning theory) for their volumes (also known as entropy, or covering numbers).  Besides the intrinsic interest in these questions, they also bear on variational problems and perhaps on computation (as in, for example, the Blum-Shub-Smale model).  Earlier variants of these quantitative concerns have already arisen in the study of square integrable cohomology and controlled (and bounded) topology.  These theories will continue to be studied, hopefully revealing more subtle refinements of the Borel/Baum-Connes conjectures in special cases (such as virtually solvable groups) and applications to understanding group actions on aspherical manifolds.  Interestingly, although there is currently no known quantitative bound at all on the number of embeddings of one manifold in another in codimension at least three, finiteness is known (for any Bi-Lipschitz bound), there is a natural strategy combining controlled topology with new information about function spaces to give, conjecturally, sharp estimates for these finite numbers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Douglas in 1932 for his advances in this field. Solutions of geometric variational problems can describe equilibrium configurations of physical systems or socio-economical models -- situations where we expect real-world systems to naturally reach a minimum-energy configuration.  As well, in the mathematical field of topology -- where objects are regarded as equivalent no matter how they are bent or stretched -- the solutions to variational problems can provide preferred representatives within such large equivalence classes. The investigation of geometric variational problems is thus of fundamental importance both in pure mathematics and in applications. This project is intended to significantly improve our knowledge on geometric variational problems by addressing a series of old and new questions, whose answer will require either the development of new techniques and ideas, or devising new approaches to known methods. This will be done through the collaborations with many leading experts in the field.<br/><br/>This project intends to put a step forward in the study of geometric variational problems by dealing with the following lines of research. Inspired by work of L. Simon, the investigator proposes to study the optimal regularity of the singular set for minimal surfaces close to special classes of minimal cones and to construct new examples of singular area minimizing hypersurfaces. In the free-boundary setting, following ideas of Caffarelli and Weiss, the investigator proposes to study the regularity of the singular set of solutions to the Alt-Caffarelli functional and the thin-obstacle problem. Finally, in a joint project with Y. Liokumovich, the investigator proposes the problem of constructing smooth minimal hypersurfaces for a generic set of metrics on a compact manifold, generalizing works of Hardt-Simon and N. Smale. These problems are of fundamental nature, as they could lead to extensions of theorems such as Colding-Minicozzi's proof of the finite time extinction of the Ricci flow, Marques-Neves' proof of Willmore's conjecture, or Schoen-Yau's proof of the positive mass theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One main emphasis of her research is on high-dimensional objects and phenomena. This leads to applications of her research in areas as diverse as physics, biology and medicine, computer science, optimization and economics and material science: Indeed, a mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, specifying the location, direction and speed of one gas molecule in a room six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room, then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon data scientists sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases which are not visible in low dimensions.  We can exploit those patterns, thus converting the ""curse of dimensionality"" into ""blessing of dimensionality"".  It is one purpose of this award to study such high-dimensional phenomena.<br/> <br/>Important features of this project are the study of high-dimensional objects and phenomena and their links with other areas of mathematics and mathematical sciences, such as probability, statistics and information theory.  Of particular interest are the affine invariant functionals on convex bodies in high dimensions. Among the most important such functionals are affine surface area and the p-affine surface area (a family of functionals parametrized by a real number p). Their corresponding affine isoperimetric inequalities, established by the PI and collaborators for all p, are stronger than their Euclidean counterparts and related to the famous Mahler conjecture which is still open in dimensions four and higher.  It was shown by the principal investigator that p-affine surface areas are directly related to entropies of cone measures of convex bodies which establishes a link between convex geometry and information theory. This link will be further explored, also in the context of log concave functions which are a natural extension of convex bodies in the realm of functions.  Moreover, affine surface area appears naturally in questions on approximation of convex bodies by polytopes, a further main topic of study.  The goal is to establish optimal dependence on all the relevant parameters involved in the approximation, for example the dimension and the number of vertices of the approximating polytopes. The principal investigator and her collaborators also extended the notions of affine surface area recently to a functional setting and to spherical and hyperbolic space. To establish the corresponding inequalities in those settings is a further topic of study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When one of the spaces is a well-understood `model' space, comparison geometry often provides optimal estimates that are useful for other areas of mathematics (for example, playing an essential role in the resolution of the Poincare conjecture) as well as other sciences.  In this project, the principal investigator will use comparison geometry to estimate the fundamental gap for domains in smooth manifolds.  This gap is the difference between the first two eigenvalues of the Laplacian: to explain this, the Laplacian frequently occurs in mathematical physics when modelling the propagation of waves through various media, and the eigenvalues are the resonant frequencies of the domain.  The mass gap is also related to quantum mechanics, where it represents the energy needed to excite a particle from its ground state to the next energy level. Advancement in this project will thus have potential benefits in mathematics and physics.  The PI also plans to estimate the volume entropy for non-smooth spaces known as metric measure spaces, and the PI's results on entropy rigidity will be relevant to optimal transport, information geometry and discrete geometry.  This project will also support education and training of graduate students and young researchers, through postdoctoral mentoring and teaching.<br/> <br/>This project is concerned with several problems centered around comparison geometry. By comparing to a good model, comparison geometry often provides optimal estimates.  For example, Perelman's reduced volume monotonicity, which is the fundamental tool in his work on the Poincare and geometrization conjectures, can be viewed as generalization of Bishop-Gromov volume comparison to Ricci flow. Andrews and Clutterbuck proved the fundamental gap conjecture by showing the first eigenfunction is more log-concave than the model.  The PI will study the eigenvalue and fundamental gap comparison estimates for the Laplacian (with Dirichlet boundary conditions) on a convex domain in locally symmetric spaces, and on closed manifolds (with Neumann boundary conditions) with integral Ricci curvature lower bound and non-smooth extensions.  The PI will also study the relation between comparison geometry and Ricci flow (including almost rigidity results for Ricci flow) as well as volume entropy comparison and rigidity for metric measure spaces with curvature lower bounds. Volume entropy is a fundamental geometric invariant for compact smooth manifolds, and this concept is closely related to other notions of entropy found in dynamical systems.  It plays an essential role in differential geometry and geometric group theory (among others), and studying the non-smooth case will have applications to Gromov-Hausdorff limits of smooth manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference aims at presenting and further developing the latest achievements in the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, which is one of the most fundamental conjectures in complex geometry.  The conjecture is at the intersection of two different domains that have deep impact in pure mathematics and modern physics: differential geometry and algebraic geometry.  The goal of the meeting is to gather some of the world experts in the several aspects of the Y-T-D conjecture and have them exchange ideas among themselves as well as interact with junior researchers with fresh ideas so as to make progress in the solution of the most general version of the conjecture. The conference will serve as a learning opportunity as well as a way to help make connections and open the way to mathematical collaborations.

This extension is far from being a trivial question since the csc equation is by far more difficult (non-linear 4th order PDE). Nevertheless, this topic is now booming and in the last few years many related results have been proved. The determination of the organizers is to make the conference  an opportunity to present and further develop  the latest achievements of the subject and to promote interaction between researchers of the domain.  The topics of the conference lie at the crossroads of the following research fields: complex/CR geometry, symplectic/contact geometry, complex algebraic geometry, Geometric Invariant Theory and algebraic stability, moduli spaces, complex analysis, geometric quantization, heat kernels asymptotics, geometric flows and partial differential equations, mathematical physics. Consequently, one can hope that the techniques developed and the unveiled relations will have an impact on other areas of Geometry, as the study of Einstein metrics, special holonomy geometries, moduli spaces of Kahler metrics and moduli of algebraic varieties, just to name a few.

In the setting of the Kahler-Ricci flow it is essential to understand the algebro-geometric properties of the blow-up set for the flow at any finite time singularity.  In the non-projective setting, this involves finding transcendental approaches to algebro-geometric problems-- for example, Kawamata's base point free theorem.

The equations of motion in classical mechanics are determined by the notion of a conserved quantity, energy.  A related quantity is action, which is minimized by solutions to the equations of motion.  For a closed system, such as the Kepler problem whose solutions describe paths of planets orbiting the sun,  the energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy in the system, and the action is given by the (minimized) mean value of kinetic minus potential energy.  Symplectic and contact structures emerge as we investigate these systems by unpacking the information hidden in the notions of energy and action.  Understanding the evolution and distinguishing transformations of these systems led to the development of global invariants of symplectic and contact manifolds.  <br/><br/>The PI plans to continue her work in providing foundations and applications for contact invariants stemming from nonequivariant and (circle) equivariant constructions of contact homology. Contact homology is built out of closed orbits of Reeb vector fields and counts of solutions to a nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation which interpolates between closed Reeb orbits. Reeb vector fields are Hamiltonian-like vector fields, whose flow lines are solutions to Hamilton's equations of motion, as they conserve energy. Closed Reeb orbits are of particular interest because they can be used to describe the motion of a planet orbiting a star, the closed trajectories of a satellite, and other local distance minimizing ""loops."" Contact homology can be used to better distinguish contact structures on a given smooth manifold and to extract dynamical information pertaining to the possible Reeb vector fields which can be associated to a fixed contact structure. The PI's work has shown that these invariants capture more phenomena than previously expected. She also plans to study additional structural properties of these contact and related symplectic invariants, Legendrian knots in closed contact manifolds, dynamics of Seifert fiber spaces, and symplectic embeddings. The PI plans to continue her outreach programs which have increased the access and success of underrepresented students and faculty in mathematics as well as foster greater interest in geometry and topology amongst local high school students and undergraduates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematically they are parabolic partial differential equations that deform geometric objects to their optimal shapes. In addition to their importance in geometric analysis, they also have potential applications to other mathematical disciplines, such as mathematical physics and low-dimensional topology. This award supports the investigation of two fundamental examples of geometric flows, mean curvature flow and Ricci flow. The PI will develop new ideas and robust techniques that will benefit the study of other geometric partial differential equations and related applications. In addition, the PI will place a strong emphasis on education in differential geometry and related topics through teaching, supervising undergraduate, graduate students and young scholars, and organizing seminars and conferences. The PI will also play an important role in the promotion of women and other underrepresented groups in STEM to enhance diversity and equity in the society.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is on the properties of closed hypersurfaces with low entropy. It involves an exploration of global features of the moduli space of asymptotically conical self-expanders of mean curvature flow. An overarching goal is to verify the smooth four-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture for hypersurfaces with low entropy. The second part concerns the variational construction of new examples of asymptotically conical self-expanders. The third part probes the asymptotic structure of soliton solutions to mean curvature flow as well as Ricci flow. The PI aims to show the geometry of these soliton solutions under mild topological restrictions is bounded in various senses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference is the only officially sanctioned satellite meeting in North America associated with the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from August 1-9, 2018. Holding a satellite meeting in Miami provides a unique opportunity to advance the 2018 ICM theme of pan-hemispheric cooperation in mathematics and its applications via a highly visible event at a major US research university, thereby enriching mathematical and scientific dialogue between mathematical scientists based in the United States and their counterparts in its Latin American neighbors. Customarily, ICM satellite meetings center on a narrowly focused topic within a particular mathematical sub-discipline and are held in the host country or surrounding region. ""A Pan-Hemispheric Celebration of Mathematics"" will be broader in scope than most ICM satellite meetings and will highlight four important areas at the forefront of current mathematics: algebraic geometry and topology; combinatorics; differential geometry and geometric analysis; and mathematical biology. The meeting will feature a vibrant mix of pure and applied perspectives with strong interdisciplinary connections, particularly to physics, biology and computer science.<br/><br/>The meeting will be organized around extended plenary lectures in each of the focal areas, given by leading experts in the field. These plenary lectures will be supplemented by parallel invited special sessions, with the event structured so as to offer participants a dual opportunity to learn broadly about important developments at the frontier of four important areas and to delve more deeply into one of them. Funding from NSF will be used to attract a diverse range of non-speaker participants, with a goal of advancing pan-hemispheric dialogue. The conference is part of ongoing efforts in this direction and draws its organizing committee from faculty at the University of Miami, the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (Cinvestav) in Mexico and the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil.

It is a fundamental fact that these equations do not always admit solutions.  Understanding when solutions do and do not exist provides deep insights into the nature of our universe; for example, we can narrow down the possible shapes of the universe, or the kinds of behaviors charged particles in space might exhibit.  This project aims to understand these problems, and their connections to underlying algebraic structures in a variety of settings connected with high-energy physics, and string theory.<br/> <br/>The PI plans to investigate several problems studying the relationship between existence and regularity problems for geometric PDEs on complex manifolds and algebraic geometry.  The three main settings in which this will be carried out are the existence problem for the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation, which describes BPS D-Branes on the B-side of mirror symmetry, the Kahler-Ricci flow and connections to the minimal model program, and the existence of canonical destabilizers in the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for Fano manifolds.  Each of these directions involves relating estimates for elliptic/parabolic PDEs and algebraic geometry through techniques involving birational geometry, geometric invariant theory and Riemannian convergence theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will bring together around 100 graduate students at all levels and from a variety of backgrounds and universities, along with four distinguished plenary speakers that work at the interface of algebra, geometry, and topology. The conference provides a rare opportunity for a large number of early career mathematicians with similar research interests to come together and develop mathematical relationships. In addition, this conference strongly supports interactions between graduate students from different schools, different backgrounds, and different research areas. This gives graduate students the chance to make connections with mathematicians outside of their respective universities and fields of study.<br/><br/>Graduate students will be able to establish these relationships by presenting their work, discussing ideas and asking questions after talks and during social events, and interacting with the plenary speakers. The majority of the talks will be given by graduate students, supplying them with opportunities to practice presenting their research ideas and interests to fellow students. The conference will strive to include a wide range of topics and a variety of speakers, including under-represented minorities in the field, both as participants and speakers. In addition, talks by distinguished plenary speakers will provide insights into how different parts of algebra, geometry, and topology are connected, open research questions of interest, and recent techniques used in groundbreaking work in these fields. Moreover, the organizing committee is driven by the participation of Temple graduate students with faculty support and guidance, providing the students with several professional development opportunities.<br/><br/>For further information, see https://math.temple.edu/events/conferences/gscagt/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
