The proposed research concentrates on the analytic and algebraic aspects of mathematical physics. Research topics to be pursued include: Chern-Simons theory and the structure of topological quantum field theory; infinite dimensional integrable systems and nonlinear Schrodinger equations; symbolic dynamics and branched manifolds; geometrical structures in nonrelativisitic quantum mechanics. The project also includes educational activities involving undergraduate students and high school students.    Quantum field theory is an active area within theoretical and mathematical physics: ultimately, the researchers in this field hope to come up with a rigorous and unifying framework explaining various basic forces of nature. Integrable systems constitute an important subarea within the theory of dynamical systems - a dynamical system is given by a system of ordinary differential equations; in such a system the rate at which the system evolves over time is independent of time. Dynamical systems are used to model various natural phenomena such as population growth and weather systems."

The investigator plans to utilize the geometric calculus of variations to consider desingularization and construction of minimal surfaces. In addition, the investigator proposes to show that any compact Riemannian manifold contains infinitely many distinct minimal hypersurfaces, again using the variational approach.    Minimal surfaces first arose in a soap film experiment done by the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau around 1850, where Plateau observed that a soap film surface bounded by a closed wire contour has the least surface area amongst all surfaces spanned by the same wire contour. Minimal surfaces turn out to have other remarkable mathematical properties (the average curvature at any point must equal zero); their study involves several branches of modern mathematics. Additionally, minimal surfaces can be used to model condensed matter, e.g., compound polymer systems."

Seiberg-Witten theory lies in the interface of geometric analysis, topology and algebraic geometry; it is a recent discovery motivated by problems in theoretical physics.

In particular, the investigator is interested in obtaining invariants of symplectic four-manifolds finer than the Seiberg-Witten invariants.    Our universe, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, can be thought of as a four-dimensional curved space. Four-manifolds then are a mathematical abstraction and generalization of this four dimensional curved space. They are general in that different curvature and shape properties are possible; they are abstract in that a four manifold does not necessarily sit inside an ambient space. Mathematicians have been trying to classify four-manifolds according to various schemes in recent years; the proposed research looks at so called the differentiable structure of these manifolds."

In particular, the investigator aims to work on the following conjecture due to Yau: the set of harmonic functions of k-th order polynomial growth, for any non-negative integer k, must be of finite dimension on a manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature.    Harmonic functions appear as components of complex-valued analytic functions; as such they have a rich structure theory.

A principal goal is to investigate   the dynamical and geometric structures of ""higher rank"" systems.   In particular, the investigator intends to classify hyperbolic   actions of higher rank abelian and semisimple Lie groups or actions  which preserve geometric structures, and also establish other   rigidity properties.  The investigator also plans to study   Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones) and their   geodesic flows.  Both geometric, dynamical and group theoretic   tools are used in this research.    Geometry is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally   studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues,   their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.   Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now   studied for aesthetic reasons and its close ties with physics and   other sciences and applied areas (computer vision e.g.).  Dynamical   systems is a relatively new field that investigates the evolution   of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in   a fluid flow).  New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos,   fractals) have changed our perception of the world fundamentally.   Dynamical systems have had a major impact on the sciences and   engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance has been instrumental   for developing efficient and safe codes for computer science.    Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell  biology and meteorology."

The author has achieved several key results but still there are important open problems to be solved and it seems that one has to combine techniques from ergodic theory, algebraic geometry, complex geometry and Heisenberg geometry for further approach.  2) Nonlinear extensions of Mostow rigidity--the rigidity of smooth actions of lattices in noncompact semisimple Lie groups. In particular, the author will further study the obstructions to the existence of an invariant conformal or projective or affine structure under a smooth group action and to combine the theory of differential invariants with   Zimmer's cocycle superrigidity.  3)Geometry and Dynamics around negatively curved manifolds.  The author has obtained a number of results concerning negatively curved manifolds by using techniques from ergodic theory, global analysis. There are several deep and difficult open problems(for example, the Katok entropy conjecture, the marked length spectrum problem). The potential of the dynamical and global approach deserves to be further explored. 4)Hyperbolization of negatively curved 3-maifolds. Kleinian groups. The author proved recently that a negatively curved closed manifold is either hyperbolic or  the geodesic flow preserves a measurable proper invariant distribution by considering quasiconformality in the geodesic flow. This seems to be a first nontrivial step towards another approach to the hyperbolization of negatively curved closed three-manifolds(which is a big open problem in Thurston's program). The author is also interested in the Ahlfors area conjecture.    The author's mathematical research are centered around the rigidity and flexibilit y of negatively curved spaces. From a generic point of view, most spaces are negatively curved. The intrinsic property of spaces are closely related to the dynamics of its geodesic flow. Therefore to understand these spaces(including the one we are living in)--their size, shape, and evolution, it is inevitable to study the stability, the rigidity and flexibility of   various dynamical systems(i.e. group actions) on them."

Unfortunately, quantization is not a straightforward proposition, as  evidenced by the discovery, exactly fifty years ago, by Groenewold and Van  Hove of an ``obstruction'' to quantization. Their ``no-go theorem'' asserts  that in principle it is impossible to consistently quantize every classical  observable on a Euclidean phase space, regardless of which quantization  procedure is employed. Just this past year, the principal investigator  proved that a similar result holds for the sphere. But no-go theorems are  not  universally valid; the principal investigator has recently shown that  the torus admits a consistent full quantization. The goals of this proposal  are to delineate the circumstances under which such obstructions will  appear, and to study the underlying mechanisms which produce them. Another  problem, when an obstruction does exist, is to determine the maximal  subalgebras of observables that can be consistently quantized. Solutions to  these problems might be used to refine extant quantization procedures, or  design new ones, which are adapted to the obstruction in that they will be  able to quantize these maximal subalgebras. From a mathematical standpoint,  this research will lead to structural insights into the Poisson algebras of  classical systems and their representations.  %%%            Although the universe is quantum mechanical in nature, our  perceptions of it are rooted in classical physics.

Unfortunately, quantization is not a  straightforward proposition, as ev idenced by the discovery, exactly fifty  years ago, of an ""obstruction'' to quantization. This ""no-go theorem''  asserts that in principle it is impossible to consistently quantize a  (nonrelativistic) particle, regardless of which quantization procedure is  employed. Just this past year, the principal investigator proved a similar  result for a spinning particle. But no-go theorems are not universally  valid; the principal investigator recently found a classical system which  admits a consistent quantization. The goals of this proposal are to  delineate the circumstances under which such obstructions will appear, and  to study the mechanisms which produce them. A solution to this problem  might be used to refine extant quantization procedures, or design new ones,  which are ""optimal"" in that they will be able to quantize systems to the  extent permitted by the obstruction.  ***"

She is developing new theoretical frameworks for considering such problems as well as creating new algorithms and programs for computing their solutions. The crystalline approach is to be used: the general idea behind this approach is that surfaces are composed of segments of planes, with fixed normal direction and with fixed adjacencies but with variable distance from the origin, and the motion of these segments is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations for the distances. This method may be considered as a variant of finite element method where the normal Gauss map is discretized.    It is expected that this research will advance the understanding of the role of surface free energy and kinetics in determining the shapes of surfaces and interfaces in materials as well as provide insight into the underlying mathematics.

Geometric flows arise in numerous applications. In computer vision, curvature flows have been used to smooth images and enhance boundaries (expanding flows have received a great deal attention lately in the field of computer vision, where small bubbles are expanded to detect boundaries of images); the Gauss curvature flow models the wearing of stones by water waves and the process of making ball-bearings round by impacting at random angles.

One of the objects to study, which will be a useful tool in many directions, is the affine connection associated to a stochastic differential equation. This connection provides the geometrical structure to obtain good estimates for the derivative flow of stochastic differential equations.  Those structures arising from degenerate systems are particularly investigated: there are problems of definition and of the existence of singularities. Although the main work is on finite  dimensional systems infinite dimensional ones are also considered. Bismut type  formulae and integration by  parts formulae on path spaces connected to the above are also examined. On a more directly geometrical level the concepts of spectral positivity for curvatures are considered together with its consequences for the geometry of the manifold.   Stochastic flows are typically solutions of stochastic differential equations (equations perturbed by white noise). Properties of  stochastic flows including the stability and  invariance are particularly interesting when considered together with the geometry of the  underlying spaces.  The techniques described in the proposal are used to study nonlinear equations including the blow ups and regularities of the solutions.

Geometric mechanics aims to formulate theories and problems in classical mechanics in a mathematically rigorous setting. There have been several recent successes of geometric mechanics.

The focus is on describing and explaining the geometric structure of fractals which arise in non-hyperbolic dynamics. In the holomorphic part of the project, the P.I. is particularly interested in the dynamical characterization of Holder regularity of the Fatou components and the persistence of hyperbolic subsets in Julia sets of rational functions. Holder regularity seems to be closely related to the Collet-Eckmann condition which requires exponential expansion only along the critical orbits. This direction of study was originated by Carleson, Jones and Yoccoz in their work on the dynamical classification of Fatou components which are John domains. The recent work of Jones and Makarov would imply that the Holder Julia sets are metrically small.  Generally, very little is known about the Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets which do not satisfy the Misiurewicz-Thurston condition. The P.I. has a method of estimating Hausdorff dimension for quadratic polynomials which uses induced hyperbolicity. In general,  possible methods involve:  Poincare series, conformal measures and analytical regularity of Julia sets. The second part of the project concerns real 1-dimensional systems.  The objective for S-unimodal Collet-Eckmann mappings of the interval is to prove that they induce hyperbolicity and their topological and quasisymmetrical classes coincide. The other series of problems in which progress is possible concerns the geometric properties of the distribution of the orbits and the fractal  structure of the frequency locus in the parameter space for non-invertible circle maps.    Many objects and phenomena in  nature can be described through ``fractal'' geometry which involves self-similarity of consecutive  scales and  sets of fractional dimension. Fractal shapes are not compatible with regular geometry of lines and circles.  A good example here is a very chaotic coastline shape seen on satellite pictures. Such highly complicated sets occur as the domains of attractors, locci of chaotic or bifurcational behavior in non-linear systems and are often  crucial in understanding the underlying dynamics.One of the aims of this project is to show that in many non-linear systems - these model phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology ( Josephson junction, charge density waves, population growth in ecosystems, diode-resonators, etc ) - the chaotic region is a fractal of small dimension. For example, the resistively shunted Josephson junction in microwave fields or charge-density waves in radio-frequency electric fields can be described by the differential equation of the damped driven pendulum with a periodic force. The two-dimensional return map for this equation collapses to a one-dimensional map in a parameter regime including transition to chaos.  Frequency locking, noise, and histeresis in these systems can thus be described by the dynamical properties of critical circle maps, which are studied in this project."

For the Dirichlet problem, the investigator is interested in providing a counterexample to existence of harmonic maps.    The main thrust of this project is the study of Laplacians on Riemannian manifolds.

The PI has proved that when a one- dimensional unstable manifold has a nondegenerate homoclinic tangency (and the eigenvalues satisfy a nonresonance condition) then in every neighborhood of every point of the closure of the unstable manifold, there is (in the closure of the unstable manifold) a homeomorphic copy of every member of a certain uncountable collection of continua. The goal is to prove that, in   typical one-parameter families undergoing homoclinic bifurcation, this extreme local wildness occurs for a set of parameters of positive measure. The ubiquity and diversity of the subcontinua of the closure of the unstable manifold is a result of the recurrence of arbitrary patterns of small folds in the unstable manifold. The main approach to extending the occurence of these patterns in parameter space will be to selectively excise small open sets of parameters for which the ""critical orbit"" does not recur appropriately, leaving a Cantor set of positive measure. This approach has been used successfully by a number of researchers to establish the existence of transitive attractors with nice measures. The goal here is more topological, less analytical, and the estimates should be less exacting. This   project also includes ongoing work on three other topics: algebraic invariants associated with one- and two-dimensional Markov spaces; expansive homeomorphisms on plane continua; and rotational dynamics on invariant plane continua.    In mathematical models of physical processes, there frequently occur ""attractors"" that contain the discription of the long term behavior of the model. The structure (topology) of the attractor reflects qualitative properties of this behavior. In case the model is chaotic, the structure of the attractor is extremely complicated. Chaotic attractors are of two  general types: hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic. The hyperbolic attractors are relatively well understood. The developement of techniques for understanding non-hyperbolic systems is perhaps the biggest challenge in dynamics today. Success in this project would provide the first coherent glimpse into the topological structure of non-hyperbolic attractors."

The latter requires the proof of the absence of wandering intervals for such maps as well as developing for them new analytical and dynamical methods. In the case of polynomial/rational maps we hope to combine ideas which led to the solution of the problem in question for smooth interval maps with tools from complex dynamics. We plan to work on the specification property and the space of limit sets with Hausdorff metric. Also we pose the problem of introducing new kinds of rotation numbers for orbit portraits of quadratic maps. A series of problems deals with the growth of pointwise itineraries, multipliers at periodic points and Lyapunov exponents in smooth families of interval maps. Another topic is studying rotation numbers for one-dimensional maps. We define rotation numbers as ergodic averages of a function. A specific choice of this function allows one to compute the union of all rotation numbers in interval case. This generalizes the Sharkovskii theorem and gives rise to a number of problems (connections to surface and graph/tree dynamics, rotation sets with respect to a periodic orbit, forcing relation, analogs of circle rotations and their connection with Fibonacci maps, growth and typical behavior of the rotation set in spaces of smooth interval maps in connection with the problem of hyperbolicity of a typical map, the monotonicity of the entropy in one- and multi-parameter families including unimodal families and cubic family).    Dynamical systems theory describes processes that develop over time. In particular, dynamical systems arise in physics (Lorenz map), biology and environmental studies (population dynamics) and chemistry (e.g. modeling the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction). The development of the system depends on its initial state and parameters coming from the ""environment.""  It is of great importance that we understand the future behavior which may  be exhibited by the system for the ""majority"" of its initial states; this corresponds to the description of so-called attractors to which the first part of the project is devoted. Also in the first part of the proposal we study how properties of some important dynamical systems depend on ""environmental"" parameters. Sometimes phenomena exhibited by a system are related to one another and information about some of them allows one to make a judgment about the existence of others; in other words phenomena coexist. A good example here is periodicity, i.e. cyclic occurrence of the same states in the system. It turns out that the existence of a cyclic process with a given period for some initial state guarantees that another cyclic process with a different period can be realized for a different initial state and the same environment.  In the second part of the project we plan to thoroughly study this relationship between different periods of cyclic processes in the same system."

Partial differential equations arise in many different contexts.

In particular, I want to understand as thoroughly as possible, the topological and metrical structure of the mapping invariant   sets (Siegel compacts), and stability properties.  Achieving these aims will entail sharp geometric estimates for analytic circle diffeomorphisms.  Using these tools I propose to study the boundary of what are called Siegel disks of the first type.  A long range objective of this research is to obtain a geometric theory of Small Divisors applicable to higher dimensional problems.    The theory of Dynamical Systems studies the evolution of solutions of a system of differential equations, that describe the evolution of a physical system.  Typically the solutions of these equations arising in Physical Sciences, meteorology, engineering, etc... cannot be obtained by a close formula (it is the same situation than for the roots of a polynomial: we know that there are always complex roots, but we cannot express  the roots from the coefficients by simple algebraic operations).   It is of fundamental importance in the applications to determine the future evolution of the physical system. Probably the most important problem is the question of stability: Is the system   going to have a stable evolution forever or it is going to break at some moment ?  Certainly, this is an every day problem for engineers building planes or other moving devices, but we can find much more complex situations where the solution of this problem is of capital importance.  For example, one of the hardest problems in the practice of fusion in the Tokamak machines, is the magnetohydrodynamical problem of finding stable configurations of a plasma at extremely high temperatures.  The control of fusion will provide clean energy from the water!  It is a quest ion of fundamental importance.  As mathematicians, we study the simplest situations to develop the tools to treat the more complex ones.  The theory of Small Divisors is a fundamental tool to study problems of stability in conservative situations.  Conservative situation meaning that some structure (a volume, a conformal structure,...) is preserved. This is very common in the applications, the equations of mechanics without friction are conservative for example.  In my research, I study the situation of a conformal map in the plane, that is a map that preserves angles. In this situation, there are classical Small Divisors theorems which guarantee stability   properties.  A large part of my research is devoted to study the situation where the tools of Small Divisors fail to prove stability.  New weak stability notions have been found in this setting.  The major part of my research project consists in the detailed study of these new stability features."

Minimal surfaces first arose in a series of soap film experiments done by the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau in the 19th century. These surfaces have an area-minimizing property: given a closed contour in space, the minimal surface spanning it has the smallest surface area amongst all surfaces bounding the same contour. Because of this and other extremal properties minimal surfaces find many applications in physics, chemistry and materials research. The proposed research has to do with constructing families of such minimal surfaces using complex analysis methods and a study of negatively curved 3-spaces using minimal surface techniques."

More specifically, the investigator plans to study the induced action of fundamental groups on the boundary of the universal covering space of manifolds of non-positive curvature; to pursue spectral rigidity problems for compact manifolds of negative sectional curvature; to continue his study of isoperimetric inequalities.    Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of spaces possessing a notion of distance. These are abstract spaces in that a Riemannian manifold does not have to sit inside an ambient space, unlike curves and surfaces in 3-space. The overall shape of such a space is then determined by its so called topology as well as the distance function. The proposed research has to do with understanding this interaction between the topology and distance function."
