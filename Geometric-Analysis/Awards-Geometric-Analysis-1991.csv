In particular             they will consider the singularities of Gauss maps and Lagrangian               structures, tangent cones of the Thom-Boardman singularity loci,                and Stiefel -Whitney classes of singular real analytic varieties.               The broad background of the six investigators will allow them to                apply a range of methods which might not ordinarily be focused on               this set of problems. In particular they will apply sheaf theoretic             methods, flows on Jacobians, and integral geometry in their                     research.                                                                            Singularities in geometry present a set of problems much more              difficult than those in which the surfaces studied are smooth.                  Consequently much less is known about this case and more                        sophisticated techniques are needed to make progress. On the other              hand our physical world is full of examples of spaces in which                  singularities are important - from fractures in materials to                    boundaries between liquid and solid phases of metals. Describing                and understanding these singularities is important from both a                  practical and theoretical standpoint. The principal investigators               will use their varied backgrounds to study this important                       collection of problems."

Minimal                      surfaces are surfaces which have minimal area for any prescribed                boundary curve drawn on the surface. These surfaces frequently                  occur in nature because many processes develop according to some                minimum energy principle. An important example is the solid-                    liquid boundary in a solidification process. Because there are so               many important examples of geometric minimization in the physical               sciences, a thorough understanding of the theoretical aspects of                the process can be expected to have a broad impact on science."

These L-convex manifolds are complex manifolds             which are convex with respect to sections of a bundle L.  L-convex              manifolds have recently proven useful in attacking some classical               problems in homomorphic convexity, such as the Levi problem and                 Shafarevich's Conjecture on the universal covering space of a                   projective variety.  The project involves five areas of research:               exhaustion functions, approximation of sections, embedding,                     cohomology with values in a coherent analytic sheaf, and                        characterization by local boundary conditions.

In the two dimensional                 case a Mobius structure is equivalent to a one dimensional complex              projective structure.

The theme of this research is to understand an abstract space              by placing additional structure on the space. One simple way of                 understanding this mathematical tool is to think of a simple closed             curve - perhaps twisted in some way. Now if one marks off equal                 distances on the curve thus creating a metric space, one can talk               about the relationship between points on the curve. Thus the curve              has been endowed with ""additional structure"".

The goal of the research supported             by this award is a better understanding of the topology of                      manifolds which satisfy restrictions on curvature and Ricci                     curvature in particular.

The principal investigator hopes to establish a similar result that             applies in the case of positive coupling constant.                              She will collaborate with Taubes and other experts in the course of             her research.                                                                        Gauge theory is now one of the fundamental areas in                        mathematical physics. It contains a number of deep and important                problems that are of interest to mathematicians and physicists.                 One of these problems involves the properties of finite-action                  solutions of certain variational equations that arise in the Yang-              Mills theory in three-space.  The principal investigator will focus             on an important problem in this area, namely showing the existence              of non-minimal finite-action critical points of the Yang-Mills                  functional in the case when the coupling constant is positive."

Specific               investigations will focus on liquid crystals, ferromagnetics,                   p-harmonic maps, and geodesics in varieties.                                         Many functions, mappings, and spaces arising in models of our              physical surroundings involve singularities. Two of the most                    familiar settings in which the study of singularities plays an                  important role are liquid crystal and minimal surfaces. Liquid                  crystals are commonly used to display characters in digital watches             and laptop computer screens. Minimal surfaces are those surfaces                which span a closed curve and have smallest area. A physical                    example is a soap bubble which spans a wire loop. By introducing                twists in the loop, one may easily produce a soap bubble with                   singularities. The principal investigator will study these                      singularities  using techniques from geometric measure theory. A                major aspect of the work is to develop general techniques which can             then be applied to a wide range of problems."

Minimal surface theory will be used to investigate the                          relationships between the sectional curvature and topology of a                 manifold.                                                                            A minimal surface is a surface which may be characterized as               one which has minimal surface area for any bounding curve on the                surface. It may also be characterized as one which minimizes the                ""surface tension"" energy or which has mean curvature zero. In some              sense, a minimal surface is a two dimensional analog of a geodesic,             a curve of least length joining two points. The principal                       investigator will use the theory of minimal surfaces to study                   relationships between the global properties of a space and local                properties such as curvature."

It is known that there is a relationship between certain invariants of a partial differential operator and the geometry of the space on which the operator is defined. The principal investigator will use heat kernel methods to approximate the invariants associated to the differential operators. He will use this approach to try to find an index theorem for a Laplace operator which was originally introduced to study certain problems in physics. The index theorem is the main tool used to link the topology and geometry of a space to the differential equations defined on the space. Hence if the investigator can find an index for this particular Laplace operator he will have established a method which can be applied to the study of the geometry of the space. It will be important to understand the role of curvature in such an index theory. A manifold is the mathematical object which formalizes our understanding of form, shape, and distance; a curved surface is an example of a two dimensional manifold. Partial differential equations are the equations used to describe most physical phenomena. The study of the solutions of these equations is a major branch of mathematics in itself. The principal investigator will study problems which involve both of these topics and the relationship between shape and solutions of partial differential equations. //"

This award will support research in an area of mathematics which relates geometry to partial differential equations.

Systems of partial differential equations play an important role in models of physical systems. An important example is in the area of control theory in which one would like to guide an object along a desired trajectory. The system of partial differential equations used to model this situation can be formulated as an integrable system. The research supported by this award should be particularly useful in studying this problem."

The simply connected constant curvature manifolds are Euclidean space, the sphere, and hyperbolic space. These manifolds are very special and serve as test cases for many questions in differential geometry. The principal investigator will attempt to classify all submanifolds or surfaces in these manifolds which are taut or rigid."

This research in a classical area of differential geometry attempts to explain and classify ways in which manifolds or surfaces sit inside space. In particular, the research will consider families of surfaces which fill space in layers which are curved in a fixed way. Such surfaces appear, for example, as layers in composite materials.

These problems include the motion of level sets by mean curvature, existence of multivortices of the electroweak theory in a periodic cell, and boundary value problems for surfaces of constant Gauss curvature. In addition they will study various problems associated with minimal surfaces such as rigidity and symmetry loss for periodic minimal surfaces. Many problems in mathematical physics may be framed in terms of a minimization problem. For example, given a closed curve in space one might want to find a surface with average curvature equal to zero and which has the given curve as its boundary. This problem may be restated as the problem of finding the surface of minimum area with the given curve as boundary. Such a surface occurs in a physical setting as a bubble, for example, a soap bubble. This type of problem is known as a variational problem. The principal investigators will study these problems using techniques from analysis and geometry."

The dynamics of these maps will be applied to the problem of trying to understand the automorphisms of the shift map. These techniques will also be applied to other families of interest in real dynamics including the Henon map, the standard family, and a family of maps which arise in scattering theory. Dynamical systems are playing an increasing role in various subfields of mathematics and in mathematical modeling. One of the applications to be studied in this project is an application to scattering theory. Scattering theory is the branch of mathematics which attempts to reconstruct an operator from a description of the action of the operator on functions. It is a basic tool in physics. The amalgamation of different methods is playing an important role in the solution of many mathematical and scientific problems; this project is one example of cross-disciplinary research at work."

The method of evolution equations has become an important method for finding critical points of geometric functionals and in understanding the dynamic structure of space. The evolution equations to be studied in this research can be understood physically by imagining a stretched rubber band immersed in a viscous fluid such as oil. The evolution equation for this example then describes the way in which the rubber band shrinks. The speed at which it shrinks at any point on the band is proportional to how much the band is curved at that point. Since so many physical problems involve deformation of curves or surfaces, the potential for application of this research is substantial."

The research supported by this award generally will attempt to relate the local geometric information on a manifold or surface with global information about the surface. The local information is given in terms of partial differential equations on the surface and the global information involves globally defined solutions to these partial differential equations. The theme of relating local to global information is a common one in differential geometry. One of the locally defined operators to be considered here is the Laplacian which is perhaps the most important operator for applications to engineering or physics."
