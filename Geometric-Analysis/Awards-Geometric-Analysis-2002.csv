In the class of closed, positively curved manifolds, there<br/>are few restrictions, most of which are classical, such as the<br/>Bonnet-Myers and Synge theorems. For closed, simply connected manifolds,<br/>there is essentially just Gromov's theorem bounding the total Betti number<br/>in a given dimension. Given that there are few known obstructions, it is<br/>frustrating that the set of known examples, although infinite, is<br/>relatively small. My research is concerned with understanding the geometry<br/>and topology of the known examples. More specifically, the goals are: 1)<br/>to attempt to find new examples of positively curved manifolds by studying<br/>more general metrics on biquotients (in collaboration with J.-H.<br/>Eschenburg), 2) to compute the isometry groups for the known cohomogeneity<br/>one manifolds of positive curvature and 3) to see whether the<br/>7-dimensional Berger space is diffeomorphic to a 3-sphere bundle over the<br/>4-sphere (in collaboration with N. Kitchloo).<br/><br/>Riemannian geometry arose from trying to understand curvature. <br/>Intuitively, we know that tabletops are flat while basketballs and saddles<br/>are curved.  Geometers are able to quantify curvature precisely and it<br/>provides a numerical invariant that helps distinguish objects.  For<br/>instance, the surface of a doughnut and the surface of a coffee cup have<br/>the same nature i.e., they are both surfaces with one hole, but they are<br/>shaped differently. On the other hand, the surface of a ball (usually<br/>called a sphere) is different in shape and nature from the surface of a<br/>doughnut (usually called a torus). How can we be sure that this is always<br/>the case? One may wonder if it is possible to deform the sphere suitably<br/>so that we might end up with the torus. A sphere has positive curvature<br/>everywhere while it can be shown that no matter what shape a torus takes,<br/>it will always have zero curvature somewhere. This tells us that the two<br/>objects are somehow fundamentally different from each other.  Differential<br/>geometry is also the language used to express the general theory of<br/>relativity, our best theoretical description of gravity and its effects on<br/>the universe. In general relativity, a vacuous space-time universe would<br/>be inherently flat. This idealized state is warped by the presence of<br/>masses or energy, Thus, gravity is the curvature in space-time, and by<br/>understanding the geometry of Lorentzian space-time, one may some day<br/>understand the shape of the universe. My work involves the study of<br/>positively curved objects in higher dimensions. This is part of trying to<br/>understand how the structure imposed by curvature (geometry) is essential<br/>to understanding the nature (topology) of an object and vice versa.<br/>"

The first way is to study the potential function of<br/>the Bergman metric of a polarized compact   Kaehler<br/>manifold.  For the application in the Kaehler-Einstein<br/>geometry, one needs to estimate the potential function from<br/>below for a family of manifolds. The problem is related to<br/>the stability of manifolds in the sense of Geometric<br/>Invariant Theory. The second way is to study the relation<br/>between the K stability and the Mumford stability.  Such a<br/>relation, if exists, would give one new insights of the<br/>relations  between the Kaehler-Einstein geometry and the<br/>stability of manifolds. The third way  is the geometry of<br/>moduli space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds.  A Kaehler<br/>metric on the moduli space has been defined  and was found<br/>that the Ricci curvature of such a metric is negative away<br/>from zero by the proposer. In order to introduce geometric<br/>analysis to the place, one needs to prove a version of the<br/>maximal principle on the moduli space, even if the moduli<br/>space, in general, is not smooth.<br/><br/>Einstein's general theory of relativity is a theory that<br/>interprets the concept of gravity into the geometric<br/>property of the space.  Recent development  of in physics<br/>shows that the universe may be  of dimension ten, with three<br/>dimension in space and one  dimension in time plus a tiny<br/>six  dimensional space called  Calabi-Yau threefold. One of<br/>the main mathematical tool to study the geometry of the<br/>space is differential geometry. Since the discovery of the<br/>general relativity, differential geometry becomes crucial to<br/>both mathematicians and physicists. The project is one of<br/>the main field in differential geometry. It will help a lot<br/>in understanding one of the basic force of the universe: the<br/>gravity and ultimately understanding the space we are living<br/>with. It is difficult to believe that without an extensive<br/>study of fundamental sciences such as general relativity,<br/>modern technology like the use of atomic energy can come<br/>true. By the same reason, today's fundamental study will not<br/>only enlarge our knowledge but eventually benefit people's<br/>life as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Since the ropelength functional is not smooth, there is<br/>no classical Euler-Lagrange equation describing the minimizers.  The<br/>primary aim of the projec666t is to provide an analogy to the<br/>Euler-Lagrange equation: a ""balance criterion"", which shows that a<br/>curve is ropelength critical if and only if the first variation of the<br/>length of the core curve can be balanced by a system of self-contact<br/>forces acting on the surrounding tube. The methods used to prove the<br/>balance criterion (a generalization of certain aspects of tensegrity<br/>theory to a class of ""continuous tensegrities"", using a version of the<br/>Farkas alternative theorem for linear operators on Banach spaces)<br/>promise rich applications in other areas of mathematics, such as the<br/>study of convex curves, and of ""knot energies"".<br/><br/>A natural model for a rope with a circular cross-section is a space<br/>curve surrounded by a non-self-intersecting tube of fixed radius.

The project views the tension in a tight knot as exerting a<br/>force directed towards the inside of each curve of the rope, and aims<br/>to show that such a curve is tight if this force can be resolved into<br/>a system of self-contact forces acting on the surface of the tube.<br/>This ""balance criterion"" has surprising consequences. Imagine a rope<br/>stretched horizontally, like a clothesline. If another rope is passed<br/>over the line, and pulled down until the pair is tight, the ropes form<br/>four straight segments joined to a central region where the strands<br/>curve around one another. One would expect the ropes to maintain<br/>contact throughout this curved clasp, with the two points on the<br/>inside of each bend touching one another. However, according to the<br/>balance criterion, this cannot happen: there is always a small gap<br/>between the two strands at the center of the turn. This model has<br/>already been used in molecular biology to describe the behavior of DNA<br/>strands; the new geometric information provided by the project will<br/>help to refine and extend many other appications of this model in<br/>physics, biology, and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>"

Let X be a quotient of a bounded symmetric <br/>domain by a lattice. The space of holomorphic automorphic forms can be <br/>identified with  the space of holomorphic sections of a tensor power of the <br/>canonical line bundle on X. In the context of geometric quantization this <br/>is the quantizing line bundle, X is the classical phase space, and <br/>automorphic forms are quantum states, i.e. wave functions of a particle.<br/>I shall investigate properties of Poincare series and relative Poincare series <br/>associated to real submanifolds of X.

Explicit construction of relative <br/>Poincare series associated to closed geodesics in finite volume smooth ball <br/>quotients and the spanning result can be used to obtain rational structures <br/>on the spaces of cusp forms for arithmetic subgroups of SU(n,1).

In addition to being an important <br/>and intensively studied subject by itself it has a very close relation to <br/>geometric quantization  which is a part of mathematics whose development was <br/>strongly motivated by physics and by general desire to understand better the <br/>nature of the world and to describe it in terms of suitable mathematical <br/>formalism. The main goal of geometric quantization is to find a rigorous <br/>mathematical way to pass from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics in <br/>a space which may have a very complicated geometry. More precisely, the <br/>question is how one can establish a suitable correspondence between <br/>classical observables and quantum observables. The space of wave functions <br/>is, clearly, a fundamental and very important object.

One of the questions I shall address is to what extent <br/>the procedure of geometric quantization depends on the complex structure. <br/>That leads to discussion of connections in vector bundles on certain moduli <br/>spaces which are of great interest and significance for both mathematicians <br/>and physisists.  <br/>"

Weil's reciprocity law; 2) construction of quantum field theories <br/>on algebraic curves in non-zero characteristic with Artin-Schreier and <br/>Kummer theories as main examples, proof of Artin's reciprocity law using <br/>quantum field-theoretical methods; 3) adelic formulation of the WZW <br/>theory on algebraic curves in characteristic zero.<br/><br/>In mathematical development a pivotal role is played by ideas from  <br/>physics, originated in the study of the surrounding world. The last twenty <br/>five years have been characterized by dramatic success in application <br/>of quantum fields and strings to different areas of mathematics. The idea <br/>is to probe mathematical objects by quantum theories and to measure their <br/>response in order to get new information about the various mathematical <br/>properties of these objects. Usually the output is encoded in terms of <br/>partition function and correlation functions of physical theory, and the <br/>problem is to decode it back in mathematical terms. The goals of this <br/>proposal are the following: 1) to extend further quantum-theoretic method <br/>for the study of complex analytic properties of surfaces in two <br/>dimensions and their families; 2) to develop a new systematic <br/>quantum-theoretic approach for arithmetic surfaces and algebraic number <br/>fields (like the usual field of rational numbers). Fundamental properties <br/>of these objects are discrete and it is only natural to study them at a <br/>microscopic scale using quantum theory. In particular, many classical <br/>mathematical results about fields of algebraic functions and algebraic <br/>numbers, known as reciprocity laws, can be interpreted as conservation <br/>laws (like conservation of energy) in quantum theory. The main goal of <br/>the algebraic part of the project is to develop a new approach based on <br/>quantum theory towards fundamental laws that are satisfied by the very <br/>basic mathematical objects: algebraic numbers - solutions of algebraic <br/>equations with coefficients being rational numbers, and algebraic <br/>functions - solutions of algebraic equations with coefficients being <br/>rational functions. Realization of the goals of the proposal will <br/>contribute to the fundamental interface between mathematics and physics.<br/>"

PI: Dan Knopf<br/><br/>My research centers on geometric evolution<br/>equations, notably the Ricci flow and related curvature flows. I plan<br/>to study seven areas in which I have obtained prior results, and where<br/>continued work is likely to yield new and useful mathematics. [1] When <br/>a flow converges, it is valuable to study the stability of its limit, in<br/>order to improve our global understanding of the dynamics of flows. [2] If<br/>a flow fails to converge but behaves in a nonsingular way, one can still<br/>study the dynamics of this collapse by classifying the asymptotic behavior<br/>of nearby solutions. [3] In most cases, a flow does become singular; so it<br/>is of paramount importance (particularly in regard to Hamilton's program<br/>to resolve Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture) to develop a better<br/>classification of singularities. [4] The basic method of studying<br/>singularities is the construction of a sequence of parabolic dilations<br/>(blow-ups). To take limits of these solutions, one must obtain (partial)<br/>injectivity radius estimates by various means. [5] The most powerful (but<br/>perhaps most difficult) way to obtain such injectivity radius estimates<br/>would be to study and extend existing Harnack estimates of the type<br/>pioneered by Li and Yau and further developed by Hamilton. [6] It is <br/>also useful to study the asymptotic behavior and stability of parabolic<br/>dilations at certain model singularities (a method which has been very<br/>fruitful in studying the mean curvature flow). [7] Further information<br/>about singularities can be obtained by constructing and studying solitons:<br/>self-similar solutions that often arise as limits of blow-ups. Moreover,<br/>Kaehler Ricci solitons have interesting connections with complex geometry<br/>and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/><br/>Geometric evolution studies the way an<br/>object's shape changes. In some cases, such as the mean curvature flow and<br/>porous media flow, the motivation is to model certain physical phenomena<br/>such as the motion of an interface in forming metallic alloys, the shape<br/>of a thin film of highly viscous oil, or the flow of oil in shale. In<br/>other cases, the goal is to improve the shape of an object, either to find<br/>optimal (most efficient) shapes, or else to help mathematicians recognize<br/>and classify geometric objects. My own research is part of a large program<br/>to resolve one of the most compelling open questions in mathematics: the<br/>desire to understand and classify all possible 3-dimensional shapes. But<br/>regardless of whether their motivation comes from material science or pure<br/>mathematics, all geometric evolution problems have much in common; so that<br/>the field benefits from rich cross-fertilization. In particular, ideas and<br/>techniques that are developed for any of these highly nonlinear problems<br/>are usually quickly adaptable to related applications.<br/>"

Isospectrality, i.e., the study of<br/>isospectral families and/or the geometric properties they may or<br/>may not share, impacts areas outside of spectral geometry; the<br/>research funded by this proposal thus supports the<br/>pure-mathematical foundations of these areas. The first examples<br/>of closed isospectral manifolds, Milnor's flat tori, have appeared<br/>in string theory in physics (related to mirror symmetry). The<br/>empirical science of spectroscopy has studied frequencies of atoms<br/>and molecules to provide information about vibrating objects.<br/>Inverse spectral problems also arise in medical imaging,<br/>geophysical prospection, and non-destructive testing.<br/><br/><br/>"

Many new methods of constructing complete<br/>embedded minimal surfaces have recently been found; in place of a<br/>dearth of examples just a few years ago, we now have a quite<br/>varied collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A<br/>basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them<br/>into families with common properties and understood<br/>limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that<br/>combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of<br/>geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,<br/>notably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will<br/>attack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one<br/>heliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk<br/>surface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes?  Of<br/>what families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same<br/>time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal<br/>surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass<br/>representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully<br/>documented, and useful as a research tool.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to<br/>biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;<br/>indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their<br/>foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some<br/>or several of its features in the expression we witness.  At its<br/>base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we<br/>search for principles in science that can be formulated as<br/>extremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of<br/>optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation.  This<br/>leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions<br/>of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in<br/>physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,<br/>the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating<br/>droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications<br/>range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of<br/>stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many<br/>other optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we<br/>do not have much general information about solutions to the<br/>equation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a<br/>wide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and<br/>which we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model<br/>problem, enriching our understanding of all optimization<br/>problems.<br/>"

One concerns complex analysis<br/>on infinite dimensional manifolds, and the proposed problems  <br/>are mostly cohomological in nature. They center around the<br/>computation of Dolbeault and sheaf cohomology groups. Two types<br/>of manifolds will be investigated: loop spaces of finite<br/>dimensional compact complex manifolds and Stein manifolds. One<br/>(longer term) goal will be to prove a Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch<br/>type index theorem on loop spaces, another to discover an<br/>appropriate class of sheaves for which cohomology can be proved<br/>to vanish on infinite dimensional Stein manifolds (generalization<br/>of the notion of coherent sheaves). I will also work on solving<br/>the inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations in pseudoconvex<br/>domains in Hilbert spaces. The finite dimensional component is<br/>about extending the concept of holomorphic motion from the <br/>complex plane to motions of higher dimensional complex manifolds<br/>and their subsets.

An example of<br/>such a structure is a function, which formalizes the notion<br/>of ""dependence"" among variable quantities. For instance<br/>temperature at some location on Earth depends on the<br/>latitude and the longitude of the location, but also on<br/>the altitude, and the time of the measurement: we have a function<br/>of four variables. In another context, the temperature of say<br/>a mole of a gas depends on the velocity of each molecule of the<br/>gas, thus on trillions and trillions of variables. Functions<br/>of such a huge number of variables are best understood by<br/>idealizing to infinitely many variables. These are the main<br/>objects of the proposed research: functions of infinitely<br/>many variables. The variables are complex rather than real<br/>numbers. Introducing complex variables typically streamlines<br/>problems, and having solved the complexified problem one can<br/>often go back and obtain, by restriction, a solution to the<br/>original real problem. The problems to be considered are partly<br/>motivated by various mathematical disciplines, and also by<br/>theoretical physics.<br/><br/><br/>"

Specifically, we will be concerned with : (a) quantum Yang-Mills<br/>gauge theory over surfaces, (b) a three dimensional   Chern-Simons gauge<br/>theory, and (c) other functional integrals arising from<br/>geometrical/topological quantum  theories. The goal will be to give<br/>rigorous foundations to   the mathematical expressions and objects which<br/>arise in these theories and then to use them to further develop<br/>mathematical ideas and solve specific problems. The mathematics involved<br/>includes   geometry and topology connected with  fiber bundles and Lie<br/>groups, as well as stochastic analysis and infinite-dimensional<br/>integration.

The physics is quantum<br/>field theory, which describes the quantum behavior of forces that govern<br/>the interaction between elementary particles  in nature such as those which<br/>make up protons and neutrons. This project   is concerned with development<br/>of fundamental mathematics  connected with   an area of physics. There may<br/>be potential applications to surface physics and other phenomena involving<br/>geometry and stochastics, but this project itself is devoted primarily to<br/>foundations rather than application.

In an<br/>attempt to broaden the scope of rigidity as initiated by Mostow,<br/>Margulis, Zimmer and others, we aim at results for very general<br/>(finitely generated) groups, notably fundamental groups arising<br/>in geometry.  The proposed methods are however also new and<br/>relevant for the more classical study of arithmetic and<br/>S-arithmetic groups.  There are three aspects to the project.<br/>The first is to construct cohomological invariants characterizing<br/>various geometric situations; a typical example is the<br/>interpretation of negative curvature in terms of bounded<br/>cohomology that we propose with Shalom.  The second step is to<br/>develop a suitable theory to handle these invariants in an<br/>efficient way, notably by using tools from ergodic theory.  Last,<br/>one has to apply this to concrete situations.  We focus in<br/>particular on superrigidity and cocycle superrigidity for<br/>non-linear groups and on orbit equivalence of ergodic actions.<br/><br/>The last forty years have witnessed the birth and remarkable<br/>development of what is now called ''rigidity theory''.  The first<br/>discovery in that field was this: Even though a flat space (which<br/>is the kind of space one thought we live in, from the ancient<br/>Greeks to Newton) can be deformed in many ways, some curved<br/>spaces (whose relevance to our world has been discovered by<br/>Einstein) are in a sense rigid.  Later came a discovery regarded<br/>as yet much more fundamental: The most symmetric geometric spaces<br/>turn out to be in fact arithmetic objects.  The project under<br/>consideration here is to broaden the scope this rigidity theory<br/>to many more geometric spaces, and especially to deal with<br/>situations in which the geometry cannot be reduced to<br/>arithmetics.  Actually, we propose new methods that stand out by<br/>their abstract nature and allow us to tackle situations which do<br/>not even stem from geometry, but rather regard the study of<br/>dynamics.  (Dynamics is the theory of systems that evolve in<br/>time, typically ocean currents or galaxies, and may have chaotic<br/>behaviours.)

Specific current interests are <br/>the classical/quantum correspondence, resonances, geometric scattering, and<br/>non-hermitian quantum mechanics. More precisely, the PI is interested in resonances, <br/>which are mathematical objects modeling states which have certain frequencies of <br/>oscillations (or rest energies) and rates of decay, such as unstable molecules or <br/>classical system responding to resonant forcing terms. Despite a long tradition and a <br/>lot of recent progress our understanding is still very limited. Current experimental<br/>and numerical advances provide new stimuli for our studies. Another interest of the PI is<br/>non-hermitian quantum mechanics, which deals with systems in which energy is not conserved.<br/>That is almost always present when we localize a part of a system and the global <br/>conservation of energy disapears. In a subtle way resonances already fall into this <br/>category of phenomena. The mathematical problems present here are the stability of <br/>eigenvalues and measuring the size of the resolvent of non-self-adjoint operators. <br/>That leads to the study of ``pseudospectra'' which is then related to <br/>many interesting phenomena in PDEs. Finally, the PI's interest involves mathematical <br/>scattering. It replaces spectral theory for problems on non-compact domains, and in physics <br/>almost all the data comes from scattering experiments. Many new things are constantly <br/>discovered now, ranging from scattering on locally symmetric spaces to problems<br/>related to conformal field theory.<br/><br/>Many of the phenomena discussed in this proposal are in fact more general: for instance, <br/>electromagnetic scattering can be used to model quantum scattering, and its understanding<br/>can benefit from the development of the classical/quantum correspondence.<br/>The PI's work focuses on the search for general mathematical principles,<br/>and the detailed study of specific examples is motivated by that. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The geometry of hyperbolic space has a<br/>well defined visual boundary representing the many possible ways<br/>of diverging to infinity. Moreover, the ambient hyperbolic<br/>geometry affects the geometry of the leaves of the lamination<br/>under consideration. The basic problem is then to study how these<br/>geometries relate with respect to their approach to the visual<br/>boundaries, and to examine the influence that the ambient<br/>hyperbolic geometry exerts on the leaves.  Within this program it<br/>is also natural to consider laminations whose leaves have<br/>stronger geometric or analytic properties, or both, as for<br/>example when they satisfy the minimal surface differential<br/>equation.

The objective of the<br/>proposed research is to understand the qualitative structure and<br/>asymptotic behavior of certain dynamical systems. One of the<br/>topics in this proposal is to study the behavior of<br/>two-dimensional systems evolving in a three-dimensional space,<br/>and specifically the interaction of the features of the<br/>surrounding space and the geometry and asymptotic behavior of<br/>their trajectories.

In 3+1 dimensions, this conjecture states that the <br/>total mass of a spacetime with nonnegative energy density <br/>everywhere is greater than or equal to the square root of the <br/>total area of the event horizons of all of the black holes in the <br/>spacetime divided by 16 pi.  This conjecture can be thought of as <br/>stating that the mass contributed by a collection of black holes <br/>is at least the square root of their surface areas divided 16 pi, <br/>so that nonnegative energy density everywhere else in the <br/>universe forces the total mass of the spacetime to be at least <br/>this amount.  The Penrose conjecture is best thought of as a <br/>conjecture on arbitrary three dimensional space-like slices of <br/>the spacetime.  In the special case that the space-like slice is <br/>assumed to have zero second fundamental form, the conjecture is <br/>known as the Riemannian Penrose conjecture.  This conjecture was <br/>first proved for a single black hole by Huisken and Ilmanen in <br/>1997 and then for any number of black holes by the author in <br/>1999.  The author would also like to prove the Riemannian Penrose <br/>Conjecture in dimensions higher than three and is close to <br/>announcing this result for dimensions less than eight.  <br/>Dimensions eight and higher present additional geometric and <br/>analytical challenges arising from the fact that the apparent <br/>horizons of black holes manifest themselves as minimal <br/>hypersurfaces which can have co-dimension seven singularities.  <br/>The positive mass theorem is also still open in these dimensions <br/>for similar reasons, and is another very interesting related <br/>problem.<br/><br/><br/>The motivation for the above problems is to gain a better <br/>understanding of General Relativity.  While Einstein's theory of<br/>General Relativity is experimentally the best known theory of <br/>gravity, their are many theoretical questions about the theory <br/>which are not well understood at all.  For example, given the<br/>universe at some initial time, do the Einstein equations have <br/>unique well-behaved solutions in the future as one would hope, or<br/>do singularities typically occur which might radiate or consume<br/>energy for example?  The theory also predicts the existence of<br/>black holes, and astronomers believe that they have been able to <br/>detect the location of many black holes including one which is <br/>3 million times the mass of the sun at the center of our galaxy.  <br/>Since doing experiments with black holes is currently not <br/>feasible, it makes since to understand this potentially very <br/>important phenomenon on a theoretical level for now.

For a few decades now, moduli spaces of vector bundles<br/>over curves have been prominent in mathematical physics.  A few <br/>interrelated open problems are the object of this research.  <br/>In projective space, models of moduli of vector bundles still don't have <br/>explicit description, by equations or by classification.  The generalized <br/>theta functions (sections of higher-rank vector bundles) are not developed <br/>to the point that one can describe flows of completely integrable <br/>hierarchies or perform the necessary calculations of quantum field theory<br/>(partition function, e.g.)  Finally, flows of commutative rings <br/>of partial differential operators (generalized KP flows) have not been <br/>described explicitly.  In the proposed work: on the projective-geometry side, <br/>equations for moduli spaces of higher-rank bundles and dimensions of <br/>Brill-Noether loci will be calculated by methods of representation theory <br/>and correspondences between Grassmannians.  On the analytic side, <br/>differential equations for the Kleinian functions (which generalize the <br/>Weierstrass p-function) will be derived and applied  to integrate new <br/>Hamiltonian systems and the generalized KP flows. A theme that runs through <br/>the proposed research is the classical problem of reduction: Weierstrass' students <br/>Koenigsberger and Kowalevski, respectively, characterized the abelian integrals <br/>of genus 2, 3 respectively, that reduce with ""multiplicity"" 2 to an <br/>elliptic integral; since then, very little was found in general <br/>(e.g., higher genus or multiplicity).  Progress on this problem <br/>is now under way, partly due to results that revisit the Kleinian<br/>functions, and partly to the aid of computer algebra.  The problem  of reduction is linked <br/>with the problem of curves with automorphisms, and the project includes applications of <br/>the results to differential Galois theory, monodromy of ordinary differential equations, <br/>and decoding algorithms for algebraic (Goppa) codes. <br/>  <br/><br/>Elliptic functions have an ""unreasonable effectiveness"",to borrow E.P. Wigner's phrase.  <br/>They occur when modeling harmonic oscillators, shooting billiards, measuring the <br/>amplitude of ocean waves, computing the partition functions of quantum field theory.  <br/>The word ""elliptic"" refers to the number of periods of the functions <br/>(one over the real, two over the complex numbers). Theta functions are the multi-periodic <br/>analog of elliptic functions. Although Old Masters such as Klein,  H.F. Baker and O. Bolza,<br/>obtained equations for genus-2 (4 complex periods) theta functions, most <br/>properties of theta functions are still inexplicit, including their dependence on the <br/>period lattice.  New impetus in the study of such functions came from the theory of <br/>integrable PDEs, such as the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, and the attendant<br/>algebraically completely integrable systems that have been intensively studied since the <br/>1970s.  This project will combine projective geometry and differential algebra to identify <br/>differential equations satisfied by the (Kleinian) theta functions, and apply them to <br/>find exact solutions of Hamiltonian systems and non-linear PDEs.<br/>At the same time the project will pursue the other major, <br/>""non-abelian"" generalization of theta functions, by embedding moduli spaces into projective <br/>space.  Theta functions that can be reduced to expressions in elliptic functions will be <br/>characterized geometrically and used in effective decoding algorithms.<br/><br/>"

PI: Dan Knopf<br/><br/>My research centers on geometric evolution<br/>equations, notably the Ricci flow and related curvature flows. I plan<br/>to study seven areas in which I have obtained prior results, and where<br/>continued work is likely to yield new and useful mathematics. [1] When <br/>a flow converges, it is valuable to study the stability of its limit, in<br/>order to improve our global understanding of the dynamics of flows. [2] If<br/>a flow fails to converge but behaves in a nonsingular way, one can still<br/>study the dynamics of this collapse by classifying the asymptotic behavior<br/>of nearby solutions. [3] In most cases, a flow does become singular; so it<br/>is of paramount importance (particularly in regard to Hamilton's program<br/>to resolve Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture) to develop a better<br/>classification of singularities. [4] The basic method of studying<br/>singularities is the construction of a sequence of parabolic dilations<br/>(blow-ups). To take limits of these solutions, one must obtain (partial)<br/>injectivity radius estimates by various means. [5] The most powerful (but<br/>perhaps most difficult) way to obtain such injectivity radius estimates<br/>would be to study and extend existing Harnack estimates of the type<br/>pioneered by Li and Yau and further developed by Hamilton. [6] It is <br/>also useful to study the asymptotic behavior and stability of parabolic<br/>dilations at certain model singularities (a method which has been very<br/>fruitful in studying the mean curvature flow). [7] Further information<br/>about singularities can be obtained by constructing and studying solitons:<br/>self-similar solutions that often arise as limits of blow-ups. Moreover,<br/>Kaehler Ricci solitons have interesting connections with complex geometry<br/>and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/><br/>Geometric evolution studies the way an<br/>object's shape changes. In some cases, such as the mean curvature flow and<br/>porous media flow, the motivation is to model certain physical phenomena<br/>such as the motion of an interface in forming metallic alloys, the shape<br/>of a thin film of highly viscous oil, or the flow of oil in shale. In<br/>other cases, the goal is to improve the shape of an object, either to find<br/>optimal (most efficient) shapes, or else to help mathematicians recognize<br/>and classify geometric objects. My own research is part of a large program<br/>to resolve one of the most compelling open questions in mathematics: the<br/>desire to understand and classify all possible 3-dimensional shapes. But<br/>regardless of whether their motivation comes from material science or pure<br/>mathematics, all geometric evolution problems have much in common; so that<br/>the field benefits from rich cross-fertilization. In particular, ideas and<br/>techniques that are developed for any of these highly nonlinear problems<br/>are usually quickly adaptable to related applications.<br/>"

A<br/>basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them<br/>into families with common properties and understood<br/>limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that<br/>combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of<br/>geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,<br/>notably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will<br/>attack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one<br/>heliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk<br/>surface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes?  Of<br/>what families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same<br/>time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal<br/>surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass<br/>representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully<br/>documented, and useful as a research tool.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to<br/>biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;<br/>indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their<br/>foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some<br/>or several of its features in the expression we witness.  At its<br/>base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we<br/>search for principles in science that can be formulated as<br/>extremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of<br/>optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation.  This<br/>leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions<br/>of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in<br/>physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,<br/>the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating<br/>droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications<br/>range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of<br/>stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many<br/>other optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we<br/>do not have much general information about solutions to the<br/>equation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a<br/>wide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and<br/>which we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model<br/>problem, enriching our understanding of all optimization<br/>problems.<br/>"

This hypothetical theory should live in<br/>11-dimensional space and the corresponding low energy action<br/>should be given by 11-dimensional supergravity. At this<br/>moment a rigorous definition of M-theory is not known. <br/>Nevertheless, using various heuristic tools (first of all,<br/>dualities) physicists have created a beautiful and<br/>consistent picture, where all versions of (super)string<br/>theory can be obtained as limiting cases.A promising approach <br/>to a rigorous definition of M-theory is based on so<br/>called M(atrix) theory. The action functional of BFSS M(atrix) <br/>model can be obtained from ten-dimensional supersymmetric<br/>Yang-Mills theory ( 10 D SYM theory) by means of dimensional<br/>reduction to (0+1)-dimensional space.(This means that we should <br/>consider only gauge fields that do not depend on spatial<br/>variables, but can be time-dependent.)  It was shown  by  <br/>A.Connes,  M. Douglas and A. Schwarz (1998) that<br/>compactification of M(atrix) theory  can lead<br/>to gauge theories on noncommutative spaces, in particular, on <br/>noncommutative tori.This paper  opened the way for application <br/>of Connes' noncommutative geometry to string/M-theory  . It<br/>became very popular, especially after the appearance of the<br/>influential Seiberg-Witten paper (1999) , that contains<br/>together with important new  results, the understanding of<br/>Nekrasov-Schwarz noncommutative instantons (1998),  gauge<br/>(complete) Morita equivalence defined by A.Schwarz (1998),and  <br/>Pioline-Schwarz background independence (1999)    from the<br/>string theory viewpoint. The number of papers considering  the <br/>relation of string/M-theory to noncommutative spaces grows <br/>exponentially (today it is close to a thousand); many of these<br/>articles  were influenced by the papers of A. Schwarz and his<br/>collaborators. A. Schwarz  intends  to continue his work on<br/>applications of noncommutative geometry to string/ M-theory.  <br/>He is  planning to  analyze thoroughly the general theory of <br/>gauge fields on noncommutative spaces and  its relation to the <br/>duality in physics. He would like to apply (in collaboration <br/>with M. Movshev) this general theory to  the construction<br/>and analysis of gauge theories on noncommutative curved spaces. <br/>One more direction  the PI  would like to pursue ( also<br/>together with M. Movshev) is a search of formulation<br/>M(atrix) theory ( and, more generally, maximally supersymmetric<br/>gauge theory) in a manifestly supersymmetric form. The solution <br/>of this problem is interesting by itself, but M. Movshev and <br/>A. Schwarz  are planning to use it also as  a starting point in <br/>the construction of a  maximally supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld<br/>action  for nonabelian gauge fields and on  noncommutative <br/>spaces. A.

The first is the study of<br/>rigidity theorems (i.e. metric uniqueness) on compact manifolds.  Here<br/>for example we consider isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces<br/>with the same spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami<br/>operator, or Lengths of closed geodesics) be isometric.  This also<br/>includes questions about metric rigidity induced by conjugacy of<br/>geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems.  The other theme<br/>considers infinite groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively curved<br/>spaces H (in the sense of Alexandrov).  The project is to study the<br/>relationship between the geometry of H and the induced action of G on<br/>the ideal boundary of H.  This can be considered an aspect of geometric<br/>group theory and is partially motivated by some questions of Gromov.  <br/>As well as these two major themes the proposal concerns the authors<br/>continuing work on various isoperimetric inequalities.  These groups show up as <br/>symmetries of Hadamard spaces H (which include spaces of nonpositive curvature.)   <br/><br/><br/>The first theme of the project concerns the question of whether a space<br/>can be determined by a certain set of data.  One part of this relates to<br/>questions of remote sensing.  For example: can you determine the density<br/>of an object (say a persons body or the moon) from measurements taken<br/>""from the outside""?  The CAT scan is a practical example where one<br/>determines the mass density (or more accurately the absorption<br/>coefficient) of an object from measurements of the total mass along<br/>straight lines.  An alternative set of measurements is the set of times<br/>it takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary<br/>(this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in<br/>the proposal).  The thrust of the proposed study is to determine under<br/>which circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of<br/>closed geodesics, distances between boundary points) are sufficient to<br/>completely determine the geometry of the spaces in question. Groups show up <br/>naturally as symmetries of various spaces.  The second theme of this project <br/>concerns the study a certain class of infinite groups. <br/>"

Block<br/><br/>In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in the<br/>applications of large scale or ""coarse"" methods in geometry, <br/>topology, index theory and group theory. For many topological <br/>and geometric problems of interest, this large-scale structure <br/>is relevant in answering them. The Principal Investigator will <br/>study three such instances. First, on a singular space, phenomena <br/>are affected not only by the global fundamental group, but also<br/>by a local picture of the fundamental group. The fundamental <br/>groups of the link of a stratum changes from stratum to stratum <br/>and affects the topological behavior of the space, in particular, <br/>the classification of stratified spaces must take into account <br/>this behavior. The PI proposes to study via operator K-theory<br/>how the index theory of the strata of singular spaces <br/>(as non-compact manifolds) fit together to give an index <br/>theory for the singular space itself.  Second, the PI <br/>proposes to study more generally quantitative aspects <br/>of homology theory, taking into account such issues as the <br/>images of the homology of balls of a given size in the homology <br/>of a non-compact manifold.  Applications to existence of <br/>infinitely many null-homotopic geodesics are proposed. Third, <br/>the large-scale / small-scale duality between a discrete group<br/>and its unitary representation theory has been studied under <br/>the rubric of the Baum-Connes conjecture. The PI, motivated by <br/>his work in large scale geometry proposes a broader study of <br/>this duality. This requires the development of tools from <br/>algebraic geometry (especially moduli space theory) to <br/>apply to infinite dimensional unitary representations. <br/>These tools place families of representations at the fore, <br/>which as two effects. First, families of representations <br/>seem to be more rigid then single ones. And secondly, one <br/>can concentrate ones attention on specific parts of the <br/>representation theory. Thus, the PI demonstrates, in several<br/>situations, that for lattices in Lie groups, the<br/>representation theory in an infinitesimal neighborhood <br/>of the trivial representation coincide for the lattice and <br/>the ambient group. A second type of question proposed by the <br/>PI are called reconstruction problems.  When can one reconstruct representations on the ambient group knowing its values on the<br/>lattice? The PI views this as a version of the Sampling theorem <br/>from signal processing.<br/><br/>Large scale geometry is the study of spaces as seen from an increasingly distant perspective. For many problems in geometry <br/>and topology, the phenomena at a small or moderate scale only <br/>obscure the situation and the large scale perspective shines <br/>the essential light on the subject: seeing the forest for the<br/>trees.  This proposal focuses the attention of large-scale <br/>geometry on problems in index theory and representation theory <br/>of discrete groups. Students of PI and his collaborators are <br/>involved at various stages of the project. The developments <br/>and anticipated results are intended as a bridge between <br/>algebraic and geometric topology, harmonic analysis and <br/>functional analysis. This should provide a clearer understanding <br/>of all these subjects and enhance the interaction between <br/>the experts in them.<br/>"

The objective of all the  <br/>projects is to study fundamental questions in Riemannian <br/>Geometry with two main focal points:  Contact Geometry of<br/>orbifold bundles over Fano varieties and the existence of some<br/>special (i.e., Einstein, positive Ricci curvature) metrics on such spaces. <br/>The questions and problems proposed here are deeply rooted in the<br/>principal investigators' earlier work which exploited a fundamental <br/>relationship between contact geometry of Sasakian-Einstein spaces and <br/>two kinds of Kaehler geometry, namely Q-factorial Fano varieties with <br/>Kaehler-Einstein orbifold metrics with positive scalar curvature, and <br/>Calabi-Yau manifolds with their Kaehler Ricci-flat metrics. <br/>The most recent work of the principal investigators has led to an <br/>important breakthrough in the study of such structures when,<br/>using recent results of Demailly and Kollar, the principal investigators<br/>were able to construct new examples of compact Einstein manifolds in dimension <br/>5 as well as many positive Einstein metrics on families of rational<br/>homology 7-spheres. The techniques used by the principal investigators borrow from<br/>several different fields; the algebraic geometry of Mori theory and intersection<br/>theory, the analysis of the Calabi Conjecture, and finally the<br/>classical differential topology of links of isolated hypersurface<br/>singularities. These methods can be extended much further and in<br/>various directions. An example that stands out in this respect is the <br/>question of the existence of Einstein metrics on exotic spheres, which is <br/>one of the main objectives of this proposal. More generally the principal investigators <br/>want to  address several classification problems concerning compact Sasakian-Einstein <br/>manifolds in dimensions 5 and 7. These two dimensions are important for two separate <br/>reasons. In view of earlier work higher dimensional examples can be constructed using <br/>the join construction. At the same time these two odd dimensions appear to play special <br/>role in Superstring Theory. In the context of recent developements in<br/>String and M-Theory the principal investigators also propose to<br/>investigate some related problems concerning  self-dual Einstein metrics in <br/>dimension 4 and exceptional holonomy metrics in dimension 7 and 8.<br/><br/>This project is intended to further the understanding of the mathematics<br/>of certain important types of geometry. While this endeavor is not<br/>directly motivated by advances in technology, the history of mathematics<br/>adequately demonstrates that today's pure mathematics often becomes<br/>tomorrow's applied mathematics. Indeed the mathematics being considered in<br/>this project is currently being used in the field of Elementary Particle<br/>Physics, more specifically, in the attempts at understanding a unified<br/>description of the fundamental forces of the universe.<br/><br/>-<br/>"

Many new methods of constructing complete<br/>embedded minimal surfaces have recently been found; in place of a<br/>dearth of examples just a few years ago, we now have a quite<br/>varied collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A<br/>basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them<br/>into families with common properties and understood<br/>limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that<br/>combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of<br/>geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,<br/>notably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will<br/>attack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one<br/>heliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk<br/>surface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes?  Of<br/>what families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same<br/>time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal<br/>surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass<br/>representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully<br/>documented, and useful as a research tool.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to<br/>biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;<br/>indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their<br/>foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some<br/>or several of its features in the expression we witness.  At its<br/>base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we<br/>search for principles in science that can be formulated as<br/>extremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of<br/>optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation.  This<br/>leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions<br/>of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in<br/>physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,<br/>the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating<br/>droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications<br/>range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of<br/>stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many<br/>other optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we<br/>do not have much general information about solutions to the<br/>equation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a<br/>wide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and<br/>which we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model<br/>problem, enriching our understanding of all optimization<br/>problems.<br/>"
