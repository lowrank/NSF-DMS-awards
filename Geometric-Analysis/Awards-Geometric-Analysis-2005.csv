Work of Furstenberg, Mostow, Margulis and others shows<br/>that certain dynamical systems are an important tool for studying<br/>geometric properties of important geometric spaces, particularly<br/>symmetric and locally symmetric spaces. . One important property<br/>of symmetric spaces is that they have non-positive curvature. The<br/>investigator plans to extend this work in several inter-related<br/>directions. The study of symmetric spaces will be generalized to<br/>include more general spaces of non-positive curvature as well as<br/>more general maps between spaces with an emphasis on infinite<br/>dimensional spaces.  The investigator will attempt to exploit<br/>these relationships to prove long-standing conjectures of<br/>Zimmer. The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold acts<br/>on the space of square-integrable Riemannian metrics, which is<br/>naturally an infinite-dimensional space of non-positive<br/>curvature.  In previous work the PI has extensively studied<br/>dynamics of certain groups acting on ``flat"" infinite dimensional<br/>spaces, and some present work can be viewed as generalizing those<br/>result to spaces that have curvature. Typically if one is a<br/>perturbing a dynamical system one already understands, the study<br/>of nearby dynamical systems can be reduced to properties of a<br/>flat infinite dimensional space. However, if one wants to<br/>classify dynamical systems which one does not assume are<br/>perturbations of ones that are well-understood, one is forced in<br/>a space that has curvature.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems is a young and important field of mathematics<br/>that investigates the evolution of physical or mathematical<br/>systems over time (e.g. fluid flow) while differential geometry<br/>is a more classical field that tends to study static<br/>configurations of curves and shapes in space. New ideas from<br/>dynamical systems theory such as chaos and fractals have had a<br/>profound impact on our perception of the world. One of the<br/>deepest and most influential mathematical applications of<br/>dynamical systems has been to the study of geometric properties<br/>of spaces with ""many symmetries"". The PI's research can be viewed<br/>as part of a general development in modern mathematics in which<br/>ideas from dynamics and differential geometry interact to lead to<br/>both proofs of old conjectures and exciting new discoveries. A<br/>key idea that appears repeatedly is that spaces that possess many<br/>symmetries must actually be homogeneous, i.e. any space with<br/>enough symmetry actually looks the same at every point. The PI's<br/>work on these topics has relationships with diverse areas of<br/>research including computer science (expander graphs and property<br/>(T) of Kazhdan) and celestial mechanics (KAM theory and stability<br/>of the solar system).<br/>"

The Salamon conjecture is that all contact Fano manifolds<br/>are homogeneous.  <br/>The first project is to show that the dual variety of a <br/>smooth variety of codimension less than half its dimension is a <br/>hypersurface.

Despite the enormous progress made<br/>during the last several decades, there remain many fundamental<br/>problems.  This project is to study several such problems<br/>involving the scalar curvature. The first one is to understand<br/>the boundary effect on manifolds with convex boundary and<br/>positive scalar curvature. This is closely related to<br/>understanding quasi-local mass in general relativity. A key<br/>specific case is whether a compact three-manifold with scalar<br/>curvature bigger or equal to six whose boundary is totally<br/>geodesic and isometric to the standard two-sphere is isometric to<br/>the three dimensional hemisphere. The second problem is whether<br/>on a compact hyperbolic three-manifold the Yamabe number is<br/>achieved by the hyperbolic metric. If true it will be a<br/>remarkable generalization of several deep results in Riemannian<br/>geometry. It is equivalent to the question whether the hyperbolic<br/>metric has smaller volume than any other metric with the same<br/>scalar curvature. These problems definitely will serve as great<br/>source of inspiration and lead to many other fascinating<br/>problems.<br/><br/>This project will have a broad impact outside the field of<br/>geometric analysis.

It is also conceivable that understanding boundary<br/>effect under various curvature assumptions will have applications<br/>in other areas of science and engineering.

Sobolev spaces<br/>of weakly differentiable maps appear naturally in the solution of<br/>variational or differential equations problems, but the<br/>fundamental theorems on Sobolev spaces of maps between regions in<br/>Euclidean spaces are not necessarily reproduced for maps between<br/>manifolds.  Topology in the domain and range of a mapping space<br/>can prevent approximation of an arbitrary Sobolev map by smooth<br/>maps and can force singularities to appear in solutions to<br/>variational problems.  The principal investigator's work aims to<br/>understand the analytical description of some of these<br/>topologically forced singularities.  Some particular topics<br/>include the rectifiability of defect measure of a general Sobolev<br/>map, Ginzburg-Landau type approximation for maps which are not<br/>weak limits of smooth maps, gap phenomena, extension of maps with<br/>energy control, travelling waves in planar antiferromagnets, and<br/>singularities of minimizing p-harmonic maps.  Tools include<br/>geometric measure theory, analytical techniques for simplified<br/>Ginzburg-Landau models, differential topology, and homotopy<br/>theory.<br/><br/>Physical problems often admit formulations that seek to minimize<br/>energy or some energy-like quantity over a large family of<br/>allowable configurations.  For example, the path of a beam of<br/>light follows the shortest route between two points, minimizing<br/>time and distance.  An important mathematical device for solving<br/>such ""variational problems"" is sometimes called the direct<br/>method: a sequence of realizable configurations that drive energy<br/>down toward a lowest possible value is used to construct a<br/>genuine minimizer, usually by picking out a subsequence that<br/>converges.  To make this process work mathematicians tend to work<br/>in enriched environments such as the Sobolev spaces cited above.<br/>These make convergence easier to establish, and then one has to<br/>show that the candidate minimizer is actually present in the<br/>original setting.  It is a relatively recent discovery that this<br/>procedure sometimes fails if the domain and range of the maps<br/>being studied has a bit of topological complexity, and the<br/>principal investigator's projects seek to analyze the nature of<br/>these occasional failures.<br/><br/>"

Conformal<br/>geometry is the study of properties of space which depend only on<br/>angles but not on distances.  Hyperbolic geometry involves spaces<br/>of negative curvature, in which the analogues of straight lines<br/>separate more than in usual flat space.  Several projects will<br/>study the relationship between these geometries.  Apart from the<br/>intrinsic geometric interest, one motivation is the AdS/CFT<br/>correspondence in Physics, a proposed holographic correspondence<br/>for certain physical phenomena.  The proposed activity will<br/>further enable the development of human resources through<br/>educationally oriented activities of the investigator, including<br/>advising, mentoring and teaching graduate students, and<br/>curricular development.  International cooperation and<br/>partnership will be promoted.  Ties between the mathematics and<br/>physics communities will be enhanced.

These are areas which are direct descendants of the work of Descartes on the geometry or shape of solution sets of equations. The motivations for these studies are primarily geometric, and most employ analysis, the descendent of the calculus. One project deals with geometry related to that of special mechanical systems in classical physics (Hamiltonian dynamics and integrable systems), and one deals obliquely with complex geometry related to quantum physics, specifically string theory, a highly speculative but geometrically attractive theory of elementary forces on the smallest scales. Two of the subprojects deal with what is called the growth of spaces as one travels far out in them towards the horizon. Properties that are visible at this scale are known as asymptotic properties, and the PI will study whether certain local geometric conditions can lead to regular patterned behavior in distant regions of these spaces. These projects refer to a kind of rigidity: if a modest amount of control over the growth or complexity of a space as it stretches out to its horizon, then it will ``freeze'' into a very specific and determined form. Finally, one of the subprojects deals with more algebraic problems. This means that ultimately they are questions about polynomials rather than more complicated functions. They deal with special spaces which are cut out of simpler spaces by equations, and which have maximal intersection with fixed reference spaces. Can one conclude the exact geometry from this maximal intersection property? The point is to use geometric differential equations, not dissimilar to the ones originating in mechanics. Most of these projects will be carried out with young researchers, colleagues or former students of the PI. Hopefully, they will serve to develop the research interests of these young mathematicians. In another direction, the PI hopes as well to further his interests in molecular biology and genetics, working with students on projects to understand the mathematical nature of the information carried by genetic molecules, though this grant application does not seek funding for such activities beyond a couple of undergraduate students who might have a summer research experience on such aspects of math and biology.<br/>"

Moreover, the deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has been revealed to be more complicated than previously expected. Powerful new techniques have been introduced to the field, including model manifolds, the geometry of the curve complex, drilling theorems, and end reductions. Prof. Canary proposes to use the new techniques to improve our understanding of the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, to further illuminate the still mysterious deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and to explore new directions for research in the field.<br/><br/>Prof. Canary proposes to continue his study of the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.  A 2-dimensional manifold or surface is a space which looks locally like 2-dimensional Euclidean space; examples are given by the surfaces of familiar 3-dimensional objects such as footballs or doughnuts.  Similarly, a 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. A Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in a manifold.  For example, the universe we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. For this reason, among others, the study of 3-dimensional manifolds and their geometries is natural and important. It is conjectured that 3-dimensional manifolds can be canonically decomposed into pieces of one of 8 geometric types.  The hyperbolic manifolds are the most common and least understood class of such geometric manifolds. In recent years, much progress has been made in understanding such manifolds and Prof. Canary proposes to build on and deepen that understanding.<br/><br/>"

The project contains four components related to these spaces: their geometric analysis, the development of appropriate statistical methods, the required numerical analysis, and the application of the results to medical imaging and computational anatomy. The general framework is addressed by a new approach which in some sense formalizes the mechanics of shapes. Lie groups with right invariant metrics indeed are structures on which classical laws of mechanics can be shown to hold, and in particular the conservation of momentum along paths of minimal energy. It turns out that this momentum is a key to the representation and characterization of deformations in this context. It is albeit difficult to handle, because it is usually singular, as a measure, or a distribution on a singular support. This and the numerical difficulty it creates is probably one of the main challenges that we address in our study. Other important aspects are the study of the geometry such an approach induces on shape spaces, including a study of their curvatures, and the existence and stability of normal coordinates. This will be related to open issues in shape statistics, and applied in particular to biomedical imaging problems. <br/><br/>This approach is therefore designed to provide new tools for describing and analyzing shapes. Although shapes are prevalent in the outside world and in science, this is a difficult problem. For the human mind, there is an intuitive notion of what shapes are, why they differ or look alike, or when they present abnormalities with respect to ordinary observations. Sculpture is the art of rendering existing shapes, or creating new ones, and the fact that artists are still able to provide unambiguous instances of subjects through distorted or schematic representations is a strong indication of the robustness of the human shape recognition engine. However, an analytical description of a shape is much less obvious, and humans are much less efficient for this task, as if the understanding and recognition of forms work without an accurate extraction of their constituting components. We can recognize a squash from an eggplant or a pepper via a simple outline, and even provide a series of discriminative features which distinguish them, but it is much harder to phrase a verbal description of any of them, accurate enough, say for a painter to reproduce it. It is therefore not surprising that, for mathematics, shape description remains mostly a challenge. There are however very important applications which depend on progresses made in this field, one of them being the computerized analysis of biomedical shapes (computational anatomy), which analyzes the impact of diseases on shapes of organs, obtained from modern techniques of non-invasive 3D imagery. The last fifty years of research in computer vision has shown a amazingly large variety of points of view and techniques designed for this purpose: 2D or 3D sets they delineate (via either volume or boundary), moment-based features, medial axes or surfaces, null sets of polynomials, configurations of points of interest (landmarks), to name but a few. Yet, it does not seem that any of these methods has emerged as ideal, neither conceptually nor computationally, for describing shapes. An important aspect of our study will be to describe shapes with an indirect approach, from the way they can be deformed. This is not a new idea, and can be traced back to the seminal works of D'Arcy Thompson at the beginning of the 20th century, but its mathematical formalization and the design of practical algorithms is a comprehensive task, still offering many open problems, that the present group will try to address and convey to the scientific community."

""Warm-up"" sessions for graduate<br/>students and young researchers are planned for the days leading<br/>up to the conference.

Other well-known<br/>applications of differential geometry are in engineering, for<br/>example robotics.  A further example pertains to evolution<br/>equations, which are currently a subject of keen interest to<br/>differential geometers and, at the same time, have the applied<br/>aspect of describing how some materials, or the space itself,<br/>develop in time.  A very specific example of the latter kind is<br/>provided by the mean curvature flow.  The surface of a globule of<br/>molten plastic evolves, or adapts in time, to have the minimum<br/>possible curvature; this evolution is completely determined by<br/>the globule's curvature.  This fundamental observation provides<br/>an understanding of a wide range of flow problems, and allows an<br/>approach to predicting the flow.  This has immediate relevance to<br/>injection molding of materials, for example in the dashboards and<br/>bumpers of automobiles.  But the fundamental principles behind<br/>mean curvature flow have also provided a paradigm for problems<br/>like the Ricci flow, in which the metric properties of space<br/>itself are the quantities which are evolving.  Questions of the<br/>latter kind will be central to the coming meetings of the Midwest<br/>Geometry Conference.<br/>"

He plans to use his result to<br/>solve the clasical complex Plateau problem for 3-dimensional<br/>strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds in 3-dimensional complex<br/>Euclidean space.<br/><br/>This research proposal has an important theme of unifying<br/>different fields such as CR Geometry, Complex Analysis,<br/>Singularities Theory and Algebraic Geometry together. The<br/>philosophy and technique of the proposal will also be useful in<br/>biotechnology. With the completion of human genomic sequence, it<br/>is an urgent task to accurate identify protein coding regions<br/>(exons) from genomic sequence. Similar to Yau's proposal, one can<br/>try to find numerical characters of exons which introns do not<br/>have. In this way, one may be able to identify all possible human<br/>proteins. The next important task is to predict the properties of<br/>these newly discovered proteins. Using the similar technique<br/>developed in Yau's proposal, one may able to represent each<br/>protein as a point in certain n-dimensional space.  Proteins<br/>which are closed to each other in this space should have similar<br/>properties. In this way, one can predict some properties of newly<br/>found proteins.

Consistency requirements in superstring theory suggest<br/>that we live in a 10-dimensional world, where the extra six<br/>dimensions must take the shape of a Calabi-Yau geometry.  For the<br/>past 20 years, this has led to a tremendous effort on the part of<br/>mathematicians and physicists to understand Calabi-Yau spaces,<br/>and the various questions which emerge from their role in string<br/>theory.  On the other hand, more classical areas of physics such<br/>as general relativity continue to motivate interesting questions<br/>in Riemannian geometry.  In particular, extending the Positive<br/>Mass Conjecture has important implications for geometric analysis<br/>and string theory.<br/><br/>The first two projects in this proposal examine the geometry of<br/>Calabi-Yau spaces. In studying such objects, one has to take into<br/>consideration singular Calabi-Yaus. One way to deal with<br/>singularities is to resolve them. As a result, the geometrical<br/>structure undergoes changes. The goal of the first research<br/>project is to give a complete characterization of the changes<br/>which can occur under crepant resolutions. In contrast to more<br/>traditional algebraic methods, the proposed techniques for this<br/>study involve an interplay between algebraic and analytical<br/>methods.  Another way to deal with Calabi-Yau singularities is to<br/>analyze them from the perspective of various string theory<br/>dualities. In the second project, the PI proposes to study the<br/>taxonomy of Calabi-Yau spaces for which heterotic/F-theory<br/>dualities hold. Along the way, it is hoped that this study will<br/>give a geometrical interpretation to a new conjecture of McKay<br/>which relates the exceptional simply-laced Dynkin diagrams to the<br/>Monster group and its offspring.  The focus of the third project<br/>is the Positive Mass Conjecture. In the context of general<br/>relativity it has been proved that the total mass of an isolated<br/>system is never negative, provided that the sources of the<br/>gravitational field consist of matter with nonnegative local mass<br/>density and that spacetime is asymptotically flat. Witten's proof<br/>is based on the analysis of the Dirac operator along<br/>three-dimensional spacelike submanifolds in spacetime. The goal<br/>of this research is to extend Witten's approach to prove the<br/>Positive Mass Conjecture in any dimension, in particular for<br/>non-spin manifolds.<br/><br/>To summarize, an assortment of questions in mathematics lie at<br/>the interface between geometry and physics. This proposal focuses<br/>on geometry problems which do not fit nicely into one particular<br/>field, but require a variety of techniques from different<br/>branches of geometry. Many of these problems come from physics,<br/>where ad-hoc methods need further development.<br/>"

In light of the landmark progress<br/>made recently by Perelman in Hamilton's program to resolve the<br/>Geometrization and Poincare' Conjectures, this research area is<br/>undergoing a rapid and productive expansion. The powerful<br/>innovations and profound insights in Perelman's work contribute<br/>to the extraordinary power of Ricci flow as a tool for<br/>investigating the geometry and topology of Riemannian and complex<br/>manifolds. In virtually all known applications of Ricci flow, it<br/>is critical to have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of<br/>singularity formation. Therefore, the project will investigate<br/>four aspects of singularity formation. These four objectives are<br/>chosen to build upon the prior results and current research<br/>program of the PI and to be highly relevant to promising new<br/>applications of Ricci flow. The objectives are to study (1)<br/>asymptotics of Ricci flow singularity formation, (2) analysis of<br/>Ricci flow singularities in dimension four, (3) analysis of<br/>singularity models for Kaehler-Ricci flow, and (4) the structure<br/>of reduced geometry.<br/><br/>A manifold is an object that - like our universe - looks like<br/>Euclidean space locally, but whose global topology and geometry<br/>may be much different. The broad goals of this project are to<br/>find optimal geometric structures with which to categorize<br/>manifolds. The methods used are certain partial differential<br/>equations called geometric heat flows. The idea is to let a<br/>geometric object evolve in time in such a way that its geometry<br/>improves and simplifies, possibly after a change in topology. A<br/>geometric heat flow called the Ricci flow has just yielded major<br/>breakthroughs in two of the most difficult open problems in<br/>mathematics. These successes provide great incentives to apply it<br/>to other challenging open problems and make it a very active and<br/>competitive field of research. The types of partial differential<br/>equations studied in Ricci flow have much in common with those<br/>used to model the movement of oil in shale and in thin films,<br/>combustion in porous media, heat propagation, avalanches,<br/>population dispersal, the spreading of microscopic droplets, and<br/>certain effects in plasma physics. For this reason, methods<br/>developed in this project may have important applications to<br/>those areas of applied mathematics. The project will focus on the<br/>delicate analysis needed to understand such equations as they<br/>become singular. This analysis should have important broad<br/>applications, among which are the following. (i) The methods<br/>developed, especially asymptotic analysis, should extend to the<br/>practical applications mentioned above. (ii) The project will<br/>promote interdisciplinary interactions with physics, where there<br/>are many applications for geometric classification and flow<br/>techniques. For example, theorists in general relativity want to<br/>classify possible topologies of four-dimensional<br/>space-times. Researchers in string theory and mirror symmetry are<br/>interested in understanding certain six-dimensional<br/>manifolds. The Ricci flow itself is an approximation to the<br/>renormalization flow for an important model in quantum field<br/>theory.  (iii) The project will benefit graduate education,<br/>because the PI will invest time helping students develop<br/>expertise in relevant areas of geometry, analysis, and topology.<br/>"

The main part of the program consists of<br/>several plenary lectures given by experts in specific sub-fields<br/>(who need not be Midwest-based); an opportunity is also provided<br/>for some of the participants to give contributed talks.  The<br/>current project provides for conferences in the spring of 2005,<br/>2006, and 2007 at the Ohio State University, the University of<br/>Oklahoma and, respectively, the University of Iowa.  The Ohio<br/>State conference, planned for April 29 to May 1, 2005, will focus<br/>on three topics: positively curved manifolds; Ricci flow,<br/>solitons and Einstein metrics; geometric group theory.  The lists<br/>of topics for the other two conferences are still tentative, and<br/>include: symmetric criticality; p-harmonic geometry; convexity,<br/>positively curved manifolds, and Ricci flow (Oklahoma, 2006), as<br/>well as: symmetries and overdetermined systems of PDEs; the<br/>AdS/CFT correspondence; nonlinear hyperbolic evolution equations;<br/>geometric scattering theory (Iowa, 2007).<br/><br/>The Midwest Geometry Conference is dedicated to the exchange of<br/>ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as<br/>well as dissemination of important research advances and ideas,<br/>nationwide and worldwide, in differential geometry and related<br/>fields.  A key objective of the conference is the attempt to<br/>encourage researchers and potential researchers in the Midwest,<br/>especially those who work some distance from the large research<br/>centers, as well as young people, women, and members of<br/>underrepresented groups.  ""Warm-up"" sessions for graduate<br/>students and young researchers are planned for the days leading<br/>up to the conference.  At least one of the three or four focus<br/>topics at each conference is related to applications of geometry.<br/>Historically, such applications lie primarily in physics, with<br/>prominent examples provided by Einstein's general theory of<br/>relativity and the currently accepted Standard Model of<br/>elementary particles and their interactions.  Other well-known<br/>applications of differential geometry are in engineering, for<br/>example robotics.  A further example pertains to evolution<br/>equations, which are currently a subject of keen interest to<br/>differential geometers and, at the same time, have the applied<br/>aspect of describing how some materials, or the space itself,<br/>develop in time.  A very specific example of the latter kind is<br/>provided by the mean curvature flow.  The surface of a globule of<br/>molten plastic evolves, or adapts in time, to have the minimum<br/>possible curvature; this evolution is completely determined by<br/>the globule's curvature.  This fundamental observation provides<br/>an understanding of a wide range of flow problems, and allows an<br/>approach to predicting the flow.  This has immediate relevance to<br/>injection molding of materials, for example in the dashboards and<br/>bumpers of automobiles.  But the fundamental principles behind<br/>mean curvature flow have also provided a paradigm for problems<br/>like the Ricci flow, in which the metric properties of space<br/>itself are the quantities which are evolving.

In the special case that the space-like slice is <br/>assumed to have zero second fundamental form, the conjecture is <br/>known as the Riemannian Penrose conjecture.

While Einstein's theory of<br/>General Relativity is experimentally the best known theory of <br/>gravity, their are many theoretical questions about the theory <br/>which are not well understood at all.  For example, given the<br/>universe at some initial time, do the Einstein equations have <br/>unique well-behaved solutions in the future as one would hope, or<br/>do singularities typically occur which might radiate or consume<br/>energy for example?  The theory also predicts the existence of<br/>black holes, and astronomers believe that they have been able to <br/>detect the location of many black holes including one which is <br/>3 million times the mass of the sun at the center of our galaxy.  <br/>Since doing experiments with black holes is currently not <br/>feasible, it makes since to understand this potentially very <br/>important phenomenon on a theoretical level for now.  This <br/>research project hopes to lead to a better understanding of black<br/>holes as well as energy and mass in General Relativity.    <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Hofer and Dusa McDuff<br/><br/>This instructional workshop, co-sponsored by the DFG (the German<br/>equivalent of the NSF) will bring together junior and senior<br/>researchers in the field of symplectic geometry. The field has<br/>its origins in Hamiltonian dynamics and geometric optics and has<br/>many fundamental applications. For example, numerical methods<br/>based on symplectic ideas (symplectic integrators) are used to<br/>compute the orbits of satellites and other celestial<br/>bodies. Historic highlights are KAM-Theory<br/>(Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser), which leads to a proof of the<br/>stability of our solar system, and the theory of<br/>infinite-dimensional integrable systems, which is the<br/>mathematical underpinning of fiber optics, a technology that lies<br/>at the heart of all of our communication networks. More recently,<br/>the rapidly developing theory of pseudoholomorphic curves has led<br/>to deep new insights into the structure of three and<br/>four-dimensional space, and to unexpected new connections between<br/>geometry and physics.  It is a surprising fact that the same<br/>underlying ideas apply to geometric optics, to dynamics and to<br/>the most abstract physics (i.e. string theory).<br/><br/>It is the purpose of this instructional workshop to describe the<br/>construction of symplectic field theory (SFT) in detail. SFT is a<br/>comprehensive theory of symplectic invariants, including such<br/>well-known theories as Floer theory, Gromov-Witten theory and<br/>contact homology. It is constructed by measuring moduli spaces of<br/>pseudoholomorphic curves. The richness of its structure comes<br/>from the fact that the moduli spaces have boundaries and<br/>singularities and that infinitely many moduli spaces interact<br/>with each other.  These structures can be captured by a novel<br/>nonlinear Fredholm theory which is distinguished by two<br/>facts. The ambient spaces do not carry smooth structures in the<br/>usual sense and even have locally varying dimensions. However<br/>there is a notion of transversality (or regularity), and at<br/>regular points the solution sets are smooth orbifolds with<br/>boundaries and corners.  Moreover the theory makes precise what<br/>it means for infinitely many Fredholm operators to interact with<br/>each other, which leads to a so-called ""Fredholm Theory with<br/>Operations"". This abstract Fredholm Theory is developed and<br/>illustrated by its application to SFT. The issues addressed are<br/>pertinent to a variety of important problems, and one can expect<br/>that the ideas presented at the workshop will have implications<br/>in a number of mathematical fields and their applications.<br/><br/><br/>"

In combination with Teichmuller theory, cone<br/>metrics have been applied to existence and classification problems of<br/>mimimal surfaces. Noded surfaces are natural limits of  Riemann<br/>surfaces under conformal pinching of curves. They have been used to<br/>construct families of minimal surfaces that degenerate to a suitable<br/>noded limit, using the implicit function theorem. We aim for a<br/>description of the noded limits of minimal surfaces as geometric<br/>limits of flat cone metrics. This adds a third type of limit to the<br/>formerly considered geometric and conformal limits. The conformal<br/>limits ignore the minimal surface information and consider only the<br/>Riemann surface limit, while the geometric limit retain the minimal<br/>surface nature but loose conformal and topological information by<br/>rescaling the surfaces in space. The new cone metric limit will<br/>incorporate both types of information. We hope that this description<br/>will lead to new examples and classification results. This research<br/>will be backed by numerical and graphical experiments based on a<br/>minimal surface library currently under development.<br/><br/>Minimal surfaces are mathematical abstractions of 2-dimensional shapes<br/>that arise at different scales in nature: We are all familiar with<br/>soap film experiments, but such surfaces also have been observed at<br/>the nano scale as interfaces between block copolymers.

The physical goal to minimize surface tension<br/>translates into a mathematical equation which has been of interest for<br/>over 250 years: The minimal surface equation is just at the border<br/>between what we understand by general theory and what we only can<br/>analyze numerically. Any advance at this point will most likely have<br/>its effects on other equations from mathematical physics and<br/>engineering. The methods which are being used to investigate  minimal<br/>surfaces range from geometric analysis to numerical mathematics.<br/>Recent theoretical advances from partial differential equations and<br/>Teichmuller theory allow us to study 'extreme' minimal surfaces which<br/>comparable to soap films that nearly break under deformations.<br/>Understanding these extreme surfaces not only helps us to analyze the<br/>examples we have by breaking them apart into simpler pieces but also<br/>allows the construction of exciting new surfaces by putting suitable<br/>pieces together.

The works of F. Reese<br/>Harvey and John C. Polking, both jointly and separately,involving<br/>the analysis and structure of singularities, have ranged widely<br/>over all three areas. This conference, in recognition of their<br/>scholarly and academic service, will treat important issues<br/>involving singularities raised in their works over the last 30<br/>years. It will focus on recent developments in singular spaces as<br/>an outgrowth of calibrated geometries, special Lagrangian<br/>submanifolds, removable singularity problems, and the relatively<br/>new area of singular connections. The conference will begin with<br/>an introductory session aimed at graduate students, recent<br/>Ph.D.'s, and non-specialist researchers.  The body of the<br/>conference will involve topics from the wide expertise of the<br/>invited lecturers which encompass: singularities in calibrated<br/>geometries, exceptional holonomy, CR geometry, differential<br/>characters, geometry of singular spaces, singularities of complex<br/>submanifolds and varieties, extension problems for analytic<br/>objects, geometric aspects of singular connections, special<br/>Lagrangian theory, compactification of spaces of connections, and<br/>regularity theory of harmonic maps, special Lagrangian<br/>minimizers, and Yang-Mills connections. Finally one session of<br/>the conference will be devoted to the study of a specific<br/>implementation of technology in the classroom.<br/><br/>Through mathematical models of a wide variety of phenomena from<br/>macro-economic systems, to cosmological models of the universe,<br/>to microscopic mechanics of solids, the notion of a<br/>""singularity"" has gained prominence in the last thirty<br/>years. It is identified with the sudden disruption in space or<br/>time of a smooth media. It may occur at a point, as with two<br/>colliding particles, along a curve, as with lightning, or a<br/>surface, as with an earthquake fault, or on some higher<br/>dimensional ""surface,"" as occurs in multi-parameter<br/>economic models. The basic fields in pure mathematics of<br/>analysis, geometry, and topology, have all attacked problems of<br/>understanding singularity formation and structure. This timely<br/>conference, on the occasion of the retirement of two academic<br/>leaders, brings together outstanding researchers and students<br/>from all these fields for a synergistic exchange of ideas. Many<br/>of the specific topics of the lectures of the conference have<br/>both their origins in and applications to mathematical physics,<br/>from the Lagrangian description of classical mechanical systems<br/>(1800's) to problems in string theory (1990's). The mathematical<br/>analysis of singularities provides important information for not<br/>only these well-established applications but also for new<br/>singularities arising from biological and computational problems.<br/>"

Its goal is to present recent advances in differential<br/>geometry, geometric analysis, and integral geometry to geometers<br/>from the Midwest, including junior level researchers and some<br/>graduate students.  The main part of the program consists of<br/>several plenary lectures given by experts in specific sub-fields<br/>(who need not be Midwest-based); an opportunity is also provided<br/>for some of the participants to give contributed talks.  The<br/>current project provides for conferences in the spring of 2005,<br/>2006, and 2007 at the Ohio State University, the University of<br/>Oklahoma and, respectively, the University of Iowa.  The Ohio<br/>State conference, planned for April 29 to May 1, 2005, will focus<br/>on three topics: positively curved manifolds; Ricci flow,<br/>solitons and Einstein metrics; geometric group theory.  The lists<br/>of topics for the other two conferences are still tentative, and<br/>include: symmetric criticality; p-harmonic geometry; convexity,<br/>positively curved manifolds, and Ricci flow (Oklahoma, 2006), as<br/>well as: symmetries and overdetermined systems of PDEs; the<br/>AdS/CFT correspondence; nonlinear hyperbolic evolution equations;<br/>geometric scattering theory (Iowa, 2007).<br/><br/>The Midwest Geometry Conference is dedicated to the exchange of<br/>ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as<br/>well as dissemination of important research advances and ideas,<br/>nationwide and worldwide, in differential geometry and related<br/>fields.  A key objective of the conference is the attempt to<br/>encourage researchers and potential researchers in the Midwest,<br/>especially those who work some distance from the large research<br/>centers, as well as young people, women, and members of<br/>underrepresented groups.  ""Warm-up"" sessions for graduate<br/>students and young researchers are planned for the days leading<br/>up to the conference.  At least one of the three or four focus<br/>topics at each conference is related to applications of geometry.<br/>Historically, such applications lie primarily in physics, with<br/>prominent examples provided by Einstein's general theory of<br/>relativity and the currently accepted Standard Model of<br/>elementary particles and their interactions.  Other well-known<br/>applications of differential geometry are in engineering, for<br/>example robotics.  A further example pertains to evolution<br/>equations, which are currently a subject of keen interest to<br/>differential geometers and, at the same time, have the applied<br/>aspect of describing how some materials, or the space itself,<br/>develop in time.  A very specific example of the latter kind is<br/>provided by the mean curvature flow.  The surface of a globule of<br/>molten plastic evolves, or adapts in time, to have the minimum<br/>possible curvature; this evolution is completely determined by<br/>the globule's curvature.  This fundamental observation provides<br/>an understanding of a wide range of flow problems, and allows an<br/>approach to predicting the flow.  This has immediate relevance to<br/>injection molding of materials, for example in the dashboards and<br/>bumpers of automobiles.  But the fundamental principles behind<br/>mean curvature flow have also provided a paradigm for problems<br/>like the Ricci flow, in which the metric properties of space<br/>itself are the quantities which are evolving.  Questions of the<br/>latter kind will be central to the coming meetings of the Midwest<br/>Geometry Conference.<br/>"

Topics in symplectic geometry aim to both apply and<br/>extend the ideas and theorems of the Symplectic Field Theory as<br/>developed by Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The main application<br/>so far is to the classification up to Hamiltonian diffeomorphism<br/>of Lagrangian spheres in symplectic 4-manifolds, there is ongoing<br/>work aimed at establishing similar results for higher genus<br/>surfaces. In symplectic topology such classification results at<br/>present only exist in dimension 4. Nevertheless the proposal will<br/>also strive to increase our understanding of higher dimensions.<br/>One route to such an understanding is provided by work of<br/>Donaldson showing that, after a blowing-up operation, every<br/>integral symplectic 6-manifold can be realized as a Lefschetz<br/>fibration in which the fibers are symplectic 4-manifolds and the<br/>vanishing cycles Lagrangian spheres. Regarding the underlying<br/>theory, Symplectic Field Theory allows us to split a symplectic<br/>manifold along a hypersurface and apply holomorphic curve methods<br/>to study each part separately. This is a very powerful idea, the<br/>results above rely heavily upon it, but it is fundamentally<br/>limited in that it may not be possible to split a symplectic<br/>manifold along such hypersurfaces into pieces which are<br/>sufficiently small to be completely understood. Therefore the<br/>proposal will also work to generalize the Symplectic Field Theory<br/>to allow more general splittings, for example along hypersurfaces<br/>with corners. In complex geometry the proposal plans to continue<br/>work of Burns and Hind studying complex manifolds canonically<br/>associated to real analytic Riemannian manifolds, focussing<br/>especially on the case when the Riemannian manifold is a<br/>symmetric space of the noncompact type. Then we have a class of<br/>complex manifolds which gives a nice generalization of the<br/>classical bounded symmetric domains.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry originated as the modern mathematical<br/>language of classical and quantum mechanics. This proposal will<br/>address basic mathematical problems in the area, in particular it<br/>will apply and extend the powerful new techniques known as<br/>Symplectic Field Theory. The Symplectic Field Theory is an<br/>exciting new development which promises to help us move rapidly<br/>towards our goal of describing the global nature of symplectic<br/>manifolds and Hamiltonian systems. As the problems are global in<br/>nature often they initially appear intractible, but the new<br/>methods offer the prospect of breaking down our analysis into<br/>more manageable local pieces. Eventually it should be possible to<br/>develop algorithms to solve typical problems in symplectic<br/>geometry. This will have immediate applications to theoretical<br/>physics and dynamical systems.<br/>"

In this<br/>subject, which has been studied extensively in the early years of<br/>global Riemannian geometry, only few obstructions are known, the<br/>major one being Gromov's Betti number theorem. On the other hand<br/>there are also very few known examples, mainly arising by taking<br/>quotients of left invariant metrics by a group of<br/>isometries. Recently significant progress has been made by<br/>studying positively curved manifolds under the presence of a<br/>large group of isometries, partly in the hope of finding good<br/>candidates for new examples of this type. We recently obtained a<br/>partial classification of positively curved cohomogeneity one<br/>manifolds, i.e. manifolds where a group acts isometrically with<br/>one dimensional quotient. In this classification one is left with<br/>a very interesting sequence of 7-manifolds which are,<br/>surprisingly, connected to self dual Einstein metrics and<br/>3-Sasakian geometry. We plan to investigate whether these<br/>manifolds carry a metric with positive curvature. For<br/>non-negatively curved cohomogeneity one manifolds there are many<br/>examples, constructed by the author in previous grant proposals,<br/>including some on exotic spheres. On the other hand the author<br/>also showed that the exotic Kervaire spheres cannot carry such<br/>metrics. This makes a classification of non-negatively curved<br/>manifolds a very interesting although difficult question, which<br/>the authors plans to investigate in the future.  We also plan to<br/>study geometric and topological properties of the known examples<br/>of manifolds with positive, or more generally non-negative<br/>sectional curvature. As a next step, we plan to study positively<br/>curved manifolds with low cohomogeneity.<br/><br/>Since the round sphere of constant positive curvature is the<br/>simplest and most symmetric Riemannian manifold, it is natural to<br/>ask what manifolds carry metrics with similar geometric<br/>properties, i.e. metrics with positive curvature. This fits into<br/>the natural question of what global consequences one can derive<br/>under local geometric assumptions, a major area of global<br/>Riemannian geometry. A basic unsolved question is whether exotic<br/>spheres, i.e. manifolds that look like spheres but on which<br/>ordinary calculus is quite different, can carry positively curved<br/>metrics.  Symmetries are an important aspect of many geometric<br/>questions and the principal investigator plans to study manifolds<br/>with positive or more generally non-negative curvature under the<br/>presence of a large symmetry group. One of the goals of this<br/>investigation is the search for new examples.<br/>"

Witten suggested a more general way of construction of<br/>topological quantum field theories and used it to find new<br/>interesting models. Among the most important topological theories<br/>are Chern-Simons theory, suggested by PI and Witten and solved by<br/>Witten, and Witten's topological sigma-models (A-model and<br/>B-model).

Moreover, there are celebrated<br/>problems in these areas which have proved intractible for decades<br/>(such as the ""hot spot"" conjecture of Rauch or the spectral gap<br/>conjecture of Bethe-Sommerfeld) which seem, in light of recent<br/>developments, be on the verge of being settled, and for which the<br/>underlying phenomena have recently become much better<br/>understood. Hence this program is occurring at a very exciting<br/>time for researchers in these areas, and we should have a lot to<br/>learn from each other next summer.<br/><br/>The spectrum of an object is the set of its natural frequencies<br/>of vibration. These include the spectral lines in the light<br/>emitted (or absorbed) by molecules. In many situations the<br/>frequencies arise as the set of values of a parameter for which a<br/>partial differential equation has a non-trivial solution. The<br/>most important mathematical questions concern the dependence of<br/>these frequencies on the geometric attributes of the object and<br/>the degree to which information about the object can be recovered<br/>from the frequencies. Several of the world's leading analysts<br/>will participate in this program, and it is important opportunity<br/>for younger researchers, to gain direct access to the general<br/>subject. The future prospects of research in this branch of<br/>analysis, which is vitally important for applications to physics,<br/>chemistry and the other sciences, depend very much on the influx<br/>of persons in their twenties and thirties, and summer programs of<br/>this type provide the opportunity to learn first hand about<br/>developments that are still on the drawing boards, not accessible<br/>in books and journals.

The difficult structure of the problem requires innovative<br/>techniques and ideas beyond the well developed tools such as the<br/>method of concentration-compactness.  Recently, the PI has<br/>collaborated with F. H. Lin on the existence of these Faddeev<br/>knots and a series of important results have been obtained.  A<br/>notable feature in their study is that, although compactness may<br/>fail, existence may be achieved as a consequence of two key<br/>inequalities: the first inequality, called by them the<br/>Substantial Inequality, ensures the existence of at least one<br/>topological minimizer; the second inequality, giving an optimal<br/>sublinear upper growth estimate for the Faddeev energy in terms<br/>of the associated topological charge, implies the existence of an<br/>infinite family of topological minimizers, hence the existence of<br/>the Faddeev knots. This progress opens new directions for<br/>achieving a higher level of understanding of various unsettled<br/>aspects of the Faddeev knots, including the existence of<br/>unit-charge unknots (ring-like solitons), existence of<br/>high-charge knots and their stability, and transition pictures of<br/>knots in view of their topological and energetical<br/>characteristics. The similarity between the Faddeev energy and<br/>the Skyrme energy may be exploited to tackle the difficult<br/>existence problem of the Skyrme solitons. Indeed, a by-product of<br/>the work of F.  H. Lin and the PI will be a proof of the<br/>existence of unit-charge Skyrme solitons which corrects the<br/>flawed (but well-known) proof of M.

This project also suggests new directions<br/>for the study of the existence problems of global energy<br/>minimizers with topological characteristics in other important<br/>related areas.<br/><br/>The concept of knots is of foundational importance in<br/>science. For example, Lord Kelvin first explored the idea of<br/>using knots to model atoms and molecules.  More recently, the<br/>concept of knots has inspired various fundamental areas,<br/>including particle and condensed-matter physics, statistical<br/>mechanics, cosmology, molecular biology, and synthetic chemistry.<br/>Up until recently, mathematical work had been focused on<br/>topological and combinatorial classifications of knots, but not<br/>on existence.  In 1995, Faddeev and Niemi started a seminal study<br/>on the existence of knots as the soliton solutions of a quantum<br/>field theory model known as the Faddeev model using high-power<br/>computer simulations.  The proposed work develops a mathematical<br/>existence theory of such knots.  This work will give new insight<br/>into the mathematical structure of knots and their computer<br/>realization.<br/>"

For the special case of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano <br/>manifolds, existence was conjectured by Yau to be equivalent to the <br/>stability of the manifold in the sense of geometric invariant theory.  <br/>The principal investigator proposes to study three parabolic flows of <br/>Kahler potentials which arise naturally in this context.

The study of the J-flow has led <br/>to significant advances in understanding the lower boundedness and <br/>asymptotics of the Mabuchi energy.  The second is the Kahler-Ricci <br/>flow.

Take, for example, the two <br/>dimensional sphere - the surface of a ball.  With our usual sense of <br/>distance, this space is curved in the same way at every point.  We say <br/>that the sphere admits a 'metric of constant curvature'. Not all spaces <br/>admit such metrics, and it is an interesting and deep problem to find <br/>conditions under which they do.   A natural and beautiful approach to <br/>this problem is the parabolic, or 'heat flow' method.  The idea is <br/>simple.  The distribution of heat in an object (not subject to outside <br/>sources) will flow in time, becoming more even and finally constant - <br/>no matter what the initial distribution looked like.  In a similar way, <br/>if we start with an arbitrary notion of distance on a space, then we <br/>can apply a natural 'heat flow' and hope to prove, under the right <br/>conditions, that we obtain convergence to a metric of constant <br/>curvature, or some other special metric, as time evolves.

The first <br/>proposed project is building a model to simulate ``tree shaped'' objects <br/>in nature, and apply it to optimal mass transportation problems. The <br/>problems proposed here include building a transport theory of <br/>rectifiable varifolds, finding connections of this model with other <br/>problems, and extending this theory to more general spaces. The second <br/>project concerns minimal surfaces that live in singular spaces such as <br/>singular complex projective varieties under their intersection homology <br/>groups. In his thesis, the PI gave a rectifiable currents' version of <br/>intersection homology theory on stratified subanalytic pseudomanifolds. <br/>He showed that there exists a modified mass minimizer (which is a <br/>rectifiable current) in every intersection homology class. The <br/>associated mass minimizers turn out to be almost minimal currents. The <br/>mass minimizers the PI considered may intersect (in a controlled <br/>fashion) the singular locus of the singular space. In this proposal, the <br/>PI will continue his investigation on regularity properties of the <br/>associated mass minimizers, and possible link with Hodge theory. One of <br/>the main methods used in both projects is geometric measure theory.<br/>   <br/>The phenomenon of ``tree shaped'' path is very common in nature. Trees, <br/>railways, airlines, lightning, the circulatory system, and neural <br/>networks are common examples. The research of optimal ``tree shaped'' <br/>path not only expands the research area of mass transportation, but also <br/>of both theoretical and applied interest. Biologists are currently <br/>looking for a model to give a fundamental explanation for biological <br/>scaling laws which are mathematical expressions of how organisms' <br/>biology varies with their size. The model proposed in this research <br/>might be the desired one. As Monge's mass transport problem is strongly <br/>linked with many areas of mathematics, especially with partial <br/>differential equations, it is also possible that this new approach of <br/>mass transportation will find its applications in economics, biology, <br/>image processing and some other subjects.
