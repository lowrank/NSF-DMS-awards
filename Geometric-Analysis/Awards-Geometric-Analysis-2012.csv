Freed, Dan F. Knopf, Alan W. Reid<br/><br/>The University of Texas Geometry/Topology Research Training Grant (RTG) is a vertically integrated program to enhance the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates at the University of Texas and, through publication on the web, beyond.  The thirteen faculty members will build on the success of our previous RTG grants and also initiate new activities.  The latter include a Directed Reading Program pairing undergraduate students and graduate mentors; a new Journal Seminar for all graduate students in geometry and topology; a new series of First Cut Lectures on a variety of core topics, to be disseminated on the web; a new yearly Undergraduate Mathematics Conference; and a new series of Graduate Winter Schools for graduate students and postdocs.  All RTG activities are designed around a unified perspective on geometry and topology.  They include a healthy mix of ideas from low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, global linear and nonlinear analysis, geometric group theory, geometric representation theory, and homotopy theory; often concepts and inspiration from theoretical physics play an important role as well.  The RTG training activities are designed to promote this unified view of geometry and topology and, more broadly, of mathematics and science to young mathematicians.<br/><br/>Mathematics, the study of Number and Space, lies at the foundation of science and technology.  Geometry, the study of Space, has long had connections with and applications to the real world.  Topology investigates, very roughly, global geometric properties of spaces which do not rely on local structure. There is great interplay between Geometry and Topology-there is not a sharp boundary between them.  In the ancient world measurement was introduced to facilitate commerce; more advanced concepts, such as trigonometry, were introduced to understand the stars.  In our modern world advanced ideas in Geometry underlie abstract theories in physics and also have more immediate practical implications, for example in navigation, computer graphics, etc. The large scale structures studied in topology appear in biological and physical science; there are new applications to data analysis and signal processing as well.  Effective training of the next generation of Geometers and Topologists is vital for the continued development of these ideas, both within mathematics and for external applications.  The University of Texas Geometry/Topology Research Training Grant promotes a unified view of the field.  An open attitude towards ideas from all directions is essential for success with the challenges facing mathematics and science today.  Through local activities in Austin, and via dissemination on the web, the RTG will enhance training at all levels."

Each SLS will consist of five lectures by the principal speaker, ten 45-minute talks by invited speakers chosen by the principal speaker, and several twenty-minute contributed talks by graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. The topic in 2012 will be ""Higher Codimensional Elliptic Boundary Value Problems."" The conference will take place April 12-14, 2012. The principal speaker will be Professor Rafe Mazzeo from Stanford University. Professor Mazzeo will focus on the geometric microlocal method, stemming from the work of Melrose and his school. That encompasses a wide variety of problems, and includes detailed analyses of operators on spaces with conic points and edges, as well as somewhat less detailed results on general stratified spaces.  Beyond these general analytic approaches, talks will look at applying these tools to specific geometric problems, involving both linear and nonlinear operators. The topic in 2013 will be ""Extension and Interpolation."" The conference will take place April 4-6, 2013. The principal speaker will be Professor Charles Fefferman of Princeton University. Professor Fefferman's talks will address the following questions: suppose we are given a function f defined on a finite subset of Euclidean space, consisting of N data points. How can we compute an m-times differentiable function F on all of Euclidean space that agrees (exactly or approximately) with f at the data points, and has the least possible norm for the first m derivatives? How many computer operations does it take? What if we are allowed to discard a few of the data points? Which points should be discarded to achieve the best improvement in the interpolation? The topic in 2014 will be ''Multi-parameter Geometry and Analysis.'' The conference will take place April 10-12, 2014. The principal speaker will be Professor Alexander Nagel of the University of Wisconsin. Many results in complex and harmonic analysis in which one establishes the boundedness of some linear or sub-linear operator can be formulated in terms of geometry and analysis on spaces of 'homogeneous type'. This concept provides a general abstract setting for the concepts underlying classical Calderon-Zygmund theory of maximal functions and singular and fractional integrals.  In an important sense, a theory which uses spaces of homogeneous type as a paradigm is a one-parameter theory.  Professor Nagel's lectures will focus on some preliminary observations and results in complex and harmonic analysis which fall outside this standard one parameter theory.<br/><br/>Mathematics conferences are vital to the development of the field. They provide unique opportunity for scientists from different subfields to meet so as to (a) summarize the most recent progress in these fields, and their interactions, (b) present new directions of research with sufficient detail to formulate and develop a list of open problems, and (c) provide an opportunity to foster new collaborations and exchange ideas toward the solution of important open questions. In the tradition of the Arkansas Spring Lectures Series, these meetings will provide unique opportunities for young researchers and graduate students to interact with prominent experts in their research areas. Public talks by Professor Lorenzo Sadun in 2012, by Professor Arlie Petters in 2013, and by Professor Colin Adams in 2014 will address audiences of the public at large. Other events include an informal lunch discussion where issues related to being women in mathematics are discussed (hosted by Arkansas Women in Statistics and Mathematics) and a reception for Arkansas graduate students and external graduate students to meet and compare their careers."

The P.I. proposes to consider generic stable maps to 2-manifolds (Morse 2-functions), Lefschetz fibrations, open book decompositions and toric and locally toric fibrations, and proposes several problems that suggest how to unify the study of these different types of functions. The study of Morse 2-functions, in collaboration with Robion Kirby, should lead to new invariants of smooth manifolds, especially of interest in dimension 4. The study of Lefschetz fibrations and open book decompositions, in collaboration with Thomas Mark, centers around symplectic convexity and 4-dimensional symplectic surgeries and is thus aimed at new constructions of symplectic 4-manifolds. Toric geometry plays a role in the P.I.'s collaboration with Olguta Buse, which looks at 3-dimensional contact analogs of symplectic embedding and packing problems. Finally, all three threads are tied together by the P.I.?s program to develop a general theory of smooth 4-manifolds with locally toric fibrations over integral affine 2-complexes (as in tropical geometry); such a picture is implicit in certain aspects of the P.I.?s work with Symington, Stipsicz and Mark and will be developed properly in this program.<br/><br/>Smooth manifolds are spaces like the one we live in, the universe. Normally we think of it as a 3-dimensional space, but if we include time it is really 4-dimensional. The dimension is just the number of numbers you need to give to specify your location (latitude, longitude and elevation, for example). Statistical social scientists work in many dimensions, for example, when they record many numbers for each individual in a survey. Understanding the overall structure (the topology) of spaces of various dimensions is important in applications ranging from robotics to statistics to biology and is also appealing for its own beauty. Here the P.I. and collaborators will work to understand this structure by casting shadows of these spaces on 2-dimensional surfaces, in much the same way that we understand the 3-dimensional world around us through images projected onto our 2-dimensional retinas. To reach out to a broader audience and encourage budding enthusiasm for mathematics, the P.I. will work with Euclid Lab to run a mathematics research program for high school students utilizing a virtual learning environment, studying questions pertaining to the main research program of this project."

It is primarily focused on the quantitative geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, specifically on estimating such quantitative invariants as volume, Margulis number and diameter in terms of topological data. This is an area in which connections with topology and several other branches of mathematics are playing unexpected roles.  Classical techniques in 3-manifold topology, some of which go back to Papakyriakopoulos's work in the 1950s, become particularly powerful when applied in the context of hyperbolic geometry. These topological ideas interact with more geometric and analytic methods, such as the log(2k-1) Theorem of Anderson, Canary, Culler and Shalen; the isoperimetric inequality for hyperbolic space; the theory of algebraic and geometric convergence of Kleinian groups; the work of Kojima and Miyamoto on hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary; and the work of Agol, Dunfield, Storm and Thurston which applies properties of the Ricci flow with surgeries to the study of Haken manifolds and Dehn filling. Furthermore, surprising interactions are emerging, via topology, between quantitative geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and their number-theoretic aspects, specifically their trace fields; this has allowed applications of deep results in number theory to the subject.<br/><br/>Non-Euclidean geometry is a classical topic in pure mathematics which has seen remarkable developments in recent decades. The subject had its origin in the attempt, begun in ancient times, to prove that Euclid's fifth axiom could be deduced from his other axioms. It was shown in the course of the 19th century that this cannot be done: there is a mathematical structure called the hyperbolic plane (in two dimensions) or hyperbolic space (in three or more dimensions) which satisfies all of Euclid's axioms except the fifth, and in which the sum of the angles of a triangle is always less than 180 degrees. Remarkably, hyperbolic geometry turns out to be much richer than Euclidean geometry. This accounts for the astonishingly varied interactions that have developed since the 1960's between hyperbolic geometry and other branches of mathematics and science.  Most of these interactions involve the study of hyperbolic manifolds, which are geometric objects that have the small-scale geometry of hyperbolic space but have a more complicated structure in the large. For example, a straight line in hyperbolic space, as in Euclidean space, always extends to infinity; but in a hyperbolic manifold, a path that is locally a straight line (called a geodesic) may exhibit globally ""periodic"" behavior like a circle. Some of the principal investigators' earliest work on hyperbolic manifolds produced a result about knots that has been applied to study the structure of recombinant DNA. They are at present investigating a variety of aspects of the geometry of hyperbolic manifolds and connections with some of the other topics mentioned above."

They seek a complete picture of the orbit structure and stability of these dynamical systems; existence, classification, and stability of soliton solutions; and Hamiltonian structure of the flows. Initially the PI will concentrate on the Davey-Stewartson, Novikov-Veselov, Kadomtsev-Petviashvili and Ishimori equations as test cases whose dynamical behavior can be studied in depth.

The PI seeks to develop analogous asymptotic methods for the oscillatory d-bar-problems that determine solutions of completely integrable partial differential equations in two dimensions,  asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials in the plane, and asymptotics of normal matrix distributions. This analysis will require new techniques and results in harmonic analysis.

Goal applications include an algorithm for testing membership in automorphism group orbits in RAAGs, and restricted versions of the subgroup membership problem.  A second goal is to define combinatorial and topological objects on which automorphism groups of RAAGs act, and to use these actions to better understand the automorphism groups.  A third goal is to prove homological finiteness results about important subgroups of automorphism groups of RAAGs; this part of the project will focus on automorphism groups of free groups specifically.<br/><br/>A right-angled Artin group (RAAG) is a type of algebraic structure in which all equations are consequences of equations asserting that certain pairs of elements commute (equations of the form ""x*y=y*x"").

RAAGs and their substructures and symmetries are important objects of study in geometric group theory; these groups include special cases that have been studied since the origins of group theory.  Free abelian groups (for example the lattice of integer points in coordinate n-space) are examples of RAAGs; their automorphism groups are matrix groups, and many questions about their structure and symmetry can be answered using familiar matrix techniques such as row and column reduction.  A class of groups called free groups are also examples of RAAGs.   Nielsen reduction and Whitehead's algorithm are combinatorial algorithms from the 1920's and 1930's for analyzing certain aspects of free groups,  and Stallings folding is a related graph-theoretical technique from the 1970's.  The main goal of the project is to construct common generalizations of these classical free group algorithms and matrix techniques that would simultaneously apply to all RAAGs, or to prove that no such generalizations exist."

The main projects include: geometry of surfaces in normed spaces, ellipticity of surface area functionals, boundary rigidity and related inverse problems, and asymptotic geometry of tori; study of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; conjugation-invariant quasi-norms; ""area structures and spaces."" The projects that form the core of the proposal have already yielded a number of important results. Among the problems the proposal is aimed at are Michel's Boundary Rigidity Conjecture, Pu's conjecture, Busemann's Conjecture that flats in normed spaces are area-minimizers, classifications of partially-hyperbolic systems, studying ""area structures,"" finding geometric (conjugation-invariant) and ""non-dynamical"" (not asymptotic) invariants of diffeomorphisms, and various generalizations of the E. Hopf Conjecture. In his previous research, the principal investigator was lucky to solve a number of such problems, including Michel's conjecture for nearly flat metrics, non-existence of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on the 3-sphere, the E. Hopf Conjecture on tori without conjugate points, the ""Boltzman-Sinaj"" problem on the existence of uniform estimates on the number of collisions in hard ball gas models, 2-dimensional cases of Busemann's problem mentioned above, Furstenberg's problem on the existence of bi-Lipschits non-equivalent separated nets and Moser's problem on Jacobian determinants of Lipschitz homeomorphisms, a problem of Hopcroft and Ullman on the complexity of the Split-Find problem, and Shefel's problem on the unboundedness of an immersed complete cylinder with finite total curvature (all from the 40s-70s). Most of the conjectures and directions of the research suggested in this proposal grew from ideas and methods developed by the PI and his collaborators while working on these problems, and the projects described in the proposal continue previous research. The PI has recently started a new research direction, discretization in Riemannian geometry.  The new approach is very different from the (classical) PL one, but it addresses both metric and spectral approximations (for differential operators).<br/><br/>If one peels off most of confusing mathematical terminology, all parts of the project deal with very practical and even computational understanding of geometric structures. One sends sound waves through the Earth and measures how long it take for them to travel from points to point (sound - because higher frequency waves dissipate, one cannot do X-rays of the Earth, and sound waves are easily detected by seismographs). From this data, how can one figure out what is inside the Earth?  The physical analogs of large-scale invariants of periodic metrics are macroscopic properties of periodic media (such as a crystal), and one wants to relate these properties to microscopic characteristics; similarly, study of partially hyperbolic systems, geodesic flows, billiard systems, and geometric complexity may result in better understanding of (stability of) many models in thermodynamics, biology, sociology, and physics, especially when dealing with imprecise data (and in practice, one always deals with imprecise data). If one wants to do a concrete analysis of a complicated geometric object (say, a Riemannian manifold), one has to deal with some finite approximations. Of course in dimension 2 gluing our space out of a bunch of triangles works, but in higher dimension we lose most of its geometric structure. There are more general approximations, but relating their characteristics to geometric properties of actual objects turns out to be a challenging mathematical task."

There will also be a ""school"" during the week preceding Poisson 2012 (July 23-27, 2012) to prepare such participants for the conference. The aim of both meetings is to bring together mathematicians and mathematical physicists who work in diverse areas, with common interests in Poisson geometry. With roots in classical mechanics about 200 years ago and the work of Sophus Lie about a century ago, the subject of Poisson geometry was crystallized through work of Kirillov and Lichnerowicz in the 1970's and has been particularly driven by the program of ""deformation quantization"", in which Poisson structures appear as the first deviation from commutativity in families of associative algebras. On the geometric side, there have been recent advances in the classification of Poisson structures, both up to (local) isomorphism, and up to the coarser relation of Morita equivalence. Poisson geometry provides a very important bridge between  mathematics and physics and between classical and quantum physics.  Although Poisson geometry has a core of internal results, it is an interdisciplinary subject. Subjects where Poisson geometry plays an essential role include string theory, symplectic geometry and topology, deformation theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, integrable Hamiltonian systems, and field theory.<br/><br/>Poisson 2012, whose full title is ""Poisson Geometry in Mathematics and Physics,"" is the eighth in a biannual series which brings  together mathematicians and mathematical physicists with common interests in Poisson geometry and its applications.  Speakers at Poisson 2012  have been chosen not only for the importance of their results but also for their ability to communicate  them to a broad audience of mathematicians and physicists. The conference will be preceded by a short school designed to prepare the audience for the more specialized talks to come. Conference proceedings will be published in a manner which  makes them accessible at low (or no) cost to a wide readership, in order to stimulate further study and research in the rapidly growing area of Poisson geometry. The ``Gone fishing"" workshop aims to bring  together  US based  leading experts  and young researchers in subjects related to  Poisson geometry to   encourage more interaction and cross fertilization between different fields.  It provides an excellent opportunity for  US based  young scientists to exchange ideas  and promote possible collaborations.<br/><br/>Detailed information about Poisson 2012 may be found at <br/>http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/poisson2012/Home.php<br/>and the ``Gone fishing workshops"" <br/>at http://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/gone-fishing.htm<br/>Information is also available at<br/>http://poissongeometry.org/"

It consists of three projects. The PI (with Thomas H. Parker) showed that the GW theory of Kahler surfaces (with a smooth canonical divisor) can be reduced to the local GW theory of spin curves. The PI also showed that the local GW theory can be reduced to the dimension zero relative local GW theory. The goal of the first two projects (with Thomas H. Parker) is to completely describe the dimension zero relative local GW theory of spin curves.  This will give a complete calculation of the GW invariants of Kahler surfaces (with a smooth canonical divisor). The goal of the third project is to extend aspects of a structure theorem for the GW invariants of Kahler surfaces to general symplectic 4-manifolds. This extension will provide a suitable notion of the number of the components of the canonical class which is a very important symplectic invariant for the topology of symplectic 4-manifolds. The extension will also remove the smoothness condition of canonical divisor in the previous projects.<br/><br/>In recent years, some long-standing mathematics problems have been solved using the newly-developed theory of GW invariants. This theory provides an innovative method for counting certain fundamental geometric objects called holomorphic curves.  The resulting counts, and the systematic methods for calculating them, have spurred significant advances in two classical fields of mathematics:  symplectic geometry and enumerative geometry. The GW invariants also play an important role bridging mathematics and theoretical physics. This project seeks to develop new geometric techniques for calculating GW invariants using methods in partial differential equations, topology and algebraic geometry. The techniques and ideas developed in this project should be very useful in other contexts."

Now a family of six-dimensional quantum field theories is emerging as an object of acute mathematical interest.  This Focused Research Group brings together researchers working in diverse parts of mathematics and physics to study these theories.  They originally arose as limits of string theories and are usually called 'superconformal (2,0)-theories' to call attention to their symmetries.  The simpler appellation 'Theory X' emphasizes how little is known.  The projects undertaken here have two overall goals.  First, we will make inroads on the structure of Theory X by applying the detailed and profound mathematical understanding of topological and conformal quantum field theories obtained over the past 25 years.  Second, we will use expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation theory.  The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry, topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant physical role. Progress towards unraveling its structure and its consequences will have broad ramifications.<br/><br/>Physics has long fueled developments in mathematics, and the past 30 years have been a particularly fruitful period.  The depth of mathematics which enters fundamental physical theories has steadily intensified, and at the same time the structure and predictions of these theories have had increasingly profound impacts on mathematics.  This project is one of many efforts to mine this intellectually fertile mix of ideas.  Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical understanding of contemporary physics.  The work of past generations at the mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a century.  While we cannot predict how current basic research will impact the future, we can say with certainty that the effect will be far-reaching."

The second main line deals with the ring R of projective invariants of n  ordered points on  complex projective m space and the equivariant symplectic geometry of the corresponding moduli spaces and their toric degenerations. All of the completed work referred to above was supported by the NSF grant DMS-0907446.  The third main line is an attempt to generalize to Kac Moody Lie algebras the PI's previous work  with Michael Kapovich (and in parts with Thomas Haines, Shrawan Kumar, and Bernhard Leeb) dealing with the generalized triangle inequalities and related (saturation) problems from reductive Lie algebras. This project was the subject of the PI's earlier FRG grant DMS-0554254 with Prakash Belkale, Thomas Haines,  Michael Kapovich and Shrawan Kumar.  The problem  looks difficult but there  is a test example that will indicate whether  the earlier  theory will generalize. That example is affine SL(2). <br/><br/>The PI proposes three main lines of research all within the general framework of reductive algebraic groups and geometry. The first part of the proposal deals with a remarkable and unexpected  interaction between geometry, analysis and two different areas of  representation theory (the oscillator/Weil representation and the work of James Arthur on the Selberg trace formula based in part on ideas of Robert Langlands). This work should have applications to number theory along the lines described by Steven Kudla in his 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians talk. The second and third parts of the proposal are motivated in part because they are related to much studied problems going back to the beginning of invariant theory in the late nineteenth century. The earlier work of the PI on the third part deals with basic problems in representation theory, e.g. decomposing tensor products and branching formulas which are much used in a number of disciplines. The current proposal outlines an extension of this work to other settings.  All the above projects are in collaboration with other mathematicians from within the USA or abroad. In the last four years, the PI has had collaborations with ten mathematicians continuing a history of extensive collaboration (over fifty joint papers)."

The PI will also use geometry and inferential statistics on graphs to try to derive neuronal classification through connectivity. The overarching theme is to bring powerful geometric tools and algebraic invariants to bear on geometrically motivated combinatorial and graph theoretic questions, and to allow the combinatorics to inform the geometric structures. The project also supports the PI's efforts to increase statistical literacy and public education through her work with journalists and the public on basic statistical and scientific reasoning.<br/> <br/>This project promotes the mutual beneficial relationship between geometry and combinatorics, or the theory of counting; an excellent example is describing how to count intersections of certain geometric spaces. Geometric spaces with a lot of symmetry can be described using methods developed in combinatorics, and these descriptions can in turn shed light on the geometry. Similarly, geometric spaces motivate the exploration of specific aspects of combinatorics. The project promotes the use of geometric and statistical techniques to study an important question in neuroscience:  how our brains are organized from a graph-theoretic point of view. Finally, the project supports the PI as Director of Research at STATS (Statistical Assessment Service, www.stats.org), where she works with journalists on how to present mathematical and statistical ideas to the public in an informative and honest way.  These efforts impact how public policy and legislation is formed; they encourages the public to become more educated regarding mathematics and quantitative reasoning concepts, even basic ones such as the difference between correlation and causation; and they show the public that mathematics and academia have an important impact on society."

The first project concerns the fundamental problems in asymptotically flat manifolds, particularly center of mass and constant mean curvature foliations.  The PI has proved that the notion of Hamiltonian center of mass is well-defined in the time-slice and has constructed the constant mean curvature foliation whose geometric center is equal to the center of mass. The PI is proposing to further investigate the properties of center of mass in spacetime and the time evolution of center of mass and the foliation. The existence of constant mean curvature foliation is important for understanding the intrinsic geometry of asymptotically flat manifolds. The PI will continue to study the existence of the foliation even when the Hamiltonian center of mass might not be defined. In addition, a new density theorem previously developed by the PI shows that the solutions with harmonic asymptotics are generic in the space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations. She intends to use the theorem to further study the physical quantities of the solutions, such as angular momentum. The second project deals with compact manifolds with boundary in various ambient spaces. The PI with Damin Wu developed the rigidity results on hemispheres for hypersurfaces with boundary in either Euclidean space or hyperbolic space. She plans to develop the analogous rigidity theorems for hypersurfaces with boundary in the sphere and for submanifolds in Euclidean space with higher codimensions under several different curvature conditions.<br/><br/>The PI's projects will lead to a better understanding of the physical quantities and their connection to geometry in asymptotically flat manifolds, which model the isolated systems in general relativity. In particular, the constant mean curvature foliation provides an intrinsic coordinate system for isolated systems. The foliation will be useful to understand the interaction of black holes in the problem of binary black holes which is fundamental in both theoretical and numerical physics. She also believes that the canonical coordinate system is helpful for numerists from different groups to compare their results established under different coordinate systems. The remainder of the PI's proposed work about compact regions with boundary naturally arises in general relativity and in various physical situations. It is fundamental to characterize and to classify the model cases, such as the flat regions and spheres. The rigidity results on these geometric objects are essential for the classification."

These equations differ from traditional differential equations in Euclidean space in that they usually encode global, geometric information. To solve them, one needs both analytic techniques and geometric insight.  This conference will feature eight speakers who are experts in various fields across geometric analysis, including General Relativity, Kahler geometry and Riemannian geometry.

The first project will build on the PI's work with Tosatti which gave an analogue of Yau's Theorem for compact Hermitian manifolds.  The PI proposes to generalize these estimates and apply them to obtain new results on the Bott-Chern space of a complex manifold.  The second project deals with the Kahler-Ricci flow - which can be regarded as the parabolic complex Monge-Ampere equation - on algebraic varieties.  As part of a program to understand the analytic minimal model program, the PI and Song investigated the Kahler-Ricci flow on algebraic varieties and gave necessary conditions under which the flow contracts an exceptional divisor.  The PI proposes to extend these results to deal with more general singularities and also to study the behavior of the curvature tensor along the Kahler-Ricci flow.  The final project concerns the Calabi-Yau equation on symplectic manifolds.  Donaldson conjectured that the complex Monge-Ampere equation solved by Yau has an analogue for symplectic 4-manifolds with compatible almost complex structures.<br/>He gave applications of his conjecture to symplectic topology. Special cases of Donaldson's conjecture were established by the PI and his co-authors.  The PI will undertake an analysis of the structure of the blow-up set for the Calabi-Yau equation, with the ultimate goal of proving Donaldson's conjecture.<br/><br/>An important problem in mathematics, and physics, is to understand the interaction between geometry and differential equations.  This proposal concerns a well-known and centuries-old mathematical object called the Monge-Ampere equation.  This equation arises naturally in the study of geometry and is closely related to Einstein's equations in physics.  A main goal of this project is to find applications of the Monge-Ampere equation to more general and commonly occuring geometric objects where it was not previously known that a connection exists.  By finding new relationships between this classical differential equation and geometry, the PI aims to further our understanding of what kind of geometric structures can exist.  In addition, the Monge-Ampere equation is deeply related to geometry via an associated heat flow.  It is expected that this heat flow will help us understand some old and difficult problems concerning solutions to algebraic equations.  Indeed, the solutions of algebraic equations define geometric objects, and the heat flow deforms these objects and can extract information from them.  The PI will investigate the precise behavior of the Monge-Ampere heat flow on such geometric objects."

Summaries of talks are publicly reported.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It is a wonderful event or phenomenon in mathematics that the results of one discipline of thought have startling and unexpected consequences in another. The conference is a valuable networking opportunity, as well as a great venue for dialogue on mathematical concepts, ideas, methods, problems, collaborations, and the direction of mathematics. By design, the Midwest Geometry Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the exchange of ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as well as dissemination of important recent advances, nationwide and worldwide, in differential geometry, geometric analysis, integral geometry, and related fields in the broad sense. This helps cement research collaborations, brother-sister-hood, and mathematical contact. Second, the conference is committed to create a focused environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with leading geometers from outside the region. The intent of the conference is to be a top-drawer, cutting-edge research conference, attempting (as much as resources permit) to bring in the appropriate speakers at all levels, independent of where they are based. The conference will reflect, complement, or interact the main areas of focus of geometers in the Midwest. Funds will be used to for the travel and hosting costs for speakers, and participants. Minorities, women, persons with disabilities, graduate students, and junior faculty are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Prior to the conference, experienced conference participants will present one or more introductory warm-up talks for interested graduate and undergraduate students. Public talks will address audiences for the public at large.

These PDE are used in programs to evolve given geometries toward ones which are in suitable senses ""optimal"" or ""canonical,"" and which are thus amenable to classification. But because these PDE generically develop singularities, a classification of those singular behaviors is necessary for the successful completion of those programs. Analyzing formation of (finite- or infinite-time) singularities is the unifying goal of this project. A key approach is the use of matched asymptotics, a technique that can provide the most precise description of the set of points on which a solution becomes singular, and of the behavior of the solution in a space-time neighborhood of that singularity. Major objectives of this proposal include: (1) removing symmetry hypotheses in asymptotic singularity analysis for mean curvature flow (MCF) and Ricci flow (RF), thereby proving that certain singularity profiles are ""universal"" in a rigorous sense; (2) constructing and analyzing (non-generic) Type-II RF singularities, which form more slowly than the natural parabolic rate and thus feature faster curvature blow-up; (3) constructing codimension-2 RF singularities and studying their asymptotics, genericity, and stability; (4) constructing and studying new examples of RF local singularity formation for complex surfaces (and complex manifolds of higher dimension) with applications to the classification of singularity models in those dimensions; (5) studying stability (properly understood) of product structures and related curvature conditions preserved by RF in low dimensions; (6) showing that singular profiles of geometric PDE depend continuously on their initial data, with applications to topology; and (7) studying formation and stability of infinite-time RF singularity models under distinct convergence schemes designed to provide asymptotics at temporal infinity, along with other geometric information.<br/><br/><br/>The theory of geometric partial differential equations (PDE) has surprising similarities with nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive equations. Furthermore, the PDE that arise in curvature flows are remarkably similar to equations that model heat propagation, the movement of oil in shale and thin films, combustion in porous media, and certain effects in plasma physics. In all of these applications, the underlying models are fundamentally nonlinear, a property which causes the associated PDE to develop various critical or singular behaviors.  The utility of these models requires a precise mathematical understanding of these behaviors. This project will further develop mathematical techniques, particularly matched asymptotic expansions, that should help the analysis of singularity formation in these varied systems and applications."

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

In a long-running collaboration with Davide Gaiotto and Greg Moore, he has studied mathematical applications of N=2 supersymmetric quantum field theory. This work has recently led to quite unexpected connections between physics and mathematical subjects such as enumerative geometry, hyperkahler geometry, and cluster algebras, and hence also to purely mathematical connections between these subjects. The proposed research builds on and extends this recent work in several directions. First, in continuing collaboration with Gaiotto and Moore, the PI will investigate new examples of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which ""count"" certain networks of geodesic trajectories on Riemann surfaces. This counting problem corresponds to determining the numbers of stable particles in certain physical theories. Also in collaboration with Gaiotto and Moore, the PI will continue development of a new method for constructing hyperkahler metrics on total spaces of integrable systems. In this new method the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants play a key role; the eventual goal is to produce asymptotic or convergent series representations for K3 metrics. Finally, in solo work, the PI will explore new mathematical structures which appear when the N=2 supersymmetric field theory is studied taking spacetime to be Taub-NUT space. This construction is expected to lead to new insights into the science of nonabelian theta functions. The PI will also produce a library of video clips, explaining concepts from physics for mathematicians at a variety of levels (from undergraduate level to other researchers). These clips will be freely available over the Web. In addition the PI will continue his active program of teaching, expository writing and talks, aimed at disseminating his methods and results more broadly.<br/><br/>The PI studies geometric problems using tools imported from particle physics. Recently, he and his collaborators have devised a new scheme for solving the ""field equation"" which governs the curvature of spacetime. This equation, first written down by Einstein, is notoriously intractable. In particular, it is known that this equation has a large family of solutions describing a closed four-dimensional universe (so-called ""K3 metrics""), but nobody has ever been able to write down actual formulas representing these solutions. The PI and collaborators have found a surprising connection between Einstein's equation and particle physics, which relates the problem of finding K3 metrics (and other similar solutions) to the problem of understanding how subatomic particles can decay. This connection has led to insight into both problems, which the PI and collaborators are now actively developing. The PI will also produce a library of video clips, explaining concepts from physics for mathematicians at a variety of levels (from undergraduate level to other researchers).

In the first project the PI will study a recent conjecture of Donaldson that aims at extending Yau's theorem in Kahler geometry to symplectic four-manifolds, building on his work with Weinkove and Yau. If proved, this conjecture would provide a powerful new tool to construct symplectic forms on compact symplectic four-manifolds, and would have striking applications to symplectic topology. The second project regards the geometry of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, and specifically the way in which Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on a Calabi-Yau manifold can degenerate when their cohomology class approaches the boundary of the Kahler cone. These degenerations have also been studied by string theorists in connection with mirror symmetry. The PI proposes to continue his study of these degenerations, as well as investigating Ricci-flat metrics on a family of quintic threefolds near a large complex structure limit. The third project falls in the area of canonical metrics on compact Kahler manifolds, such as Kahler-Einstein or constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics. It is believed that the existence of such canonical metrics should be equivalent to the algebraic stability of the manifold. The PI will study this using two natural evolution equations associated to these problems, the Kahler-Ricci flow and the Calabi flow, with the aim of connecting the limiting behaviour of the flows to algebraic stability through the use of natural energy functionals. The final project also involves canonical Kahler metrics, and more specifically the problem of existence of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics on complex surfaces with ample canonical bundle in cohomology classes that are known to be stable.<br/><br/><br/>Most of the problems that we will consider, for example the Einstein equations, were originally discovered by physicists who were searching for models of the fundamental laws of nature. More recently, geometric aspects closely related to the proposed research have found applications in high energy physics, and are being used to deepen our understanding of the Universe and of elementary particles. The geometric ideas of the PI's research revolve around the problem of finding the optimal shape of a geometric space, the one with the largest possible symmetry, and understanding the possible singularities that form in spaces where such an optimal shape does not exist. Any progress on these questions will not only shed some light on some basic problems in mathematics, but will also have applications in physics and other sciences."

In the Riemannian setting, the main problems concern eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian.  One focus is on nodal and critical point sets of quantum ergodic eigenfunctions. C. Sogge and the principal investigator recently found an identity relating nodal set integrals to L1 norms of eigenfunctions, which was used to give a lower bound on volumes of nodal sets. The PI has proved an analogous identity for critical points and plan to use it to study the distribution of critical points.  The PI also plans to continue a study of the analytic continuation of eigenfunctions to Grauert tubes as a tool to study complex zeros and critical points. Using a new result with J. Toth on quantum ergodic restriction to hypersurfaces, the PI plans to work out the distribution of intersections of geodesics and nodal sets.  In Kaehler geometry, this project will develop the approximation theory of Kaehler metrics in a fixed class by Bergman metrics. In particular the PI is studying the initial value problem for geodesics in the space of Kaehler metrics in joint work with Y. Rubinstein. We have shown that there are obstructions to solving it for long times in most directions. Another project concerns ""random metrics,"" i.e. probability measures on the space of Kaehler metrics which are defined by approximating it by the symmetric space of Bergman metrics.<br/><br/>For almost 100 years now, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are the basic theories in physics. Quantum physics is not an intuitive theory that can be related to the ordinary world in the way that mechanics or electricity and magnetism can be.  So it is important to study simple models which exhibit the basic quantum features. Vibrating drums and surfaces have been studied since Chladni in 1800 and yet the basic questions asked by Chladni are completely open. If one pours sand on a vibrating drum, it will settle into ""nodal patterns"" which are the points where the vibrating drum is not moving up and down but staying still.  These nodal patterns allow us to visualize the modes of vibration of the drum. As the frequency of vibration increases, the pattern becomes more and more complicated. There exist youtube videos of sand poured on vibrating drums where one can see the patterns, but it is very hard to predict what they will look like. Physicists conjecture that if the billiards played on the drum are ""chaotic"" (i.e unpredictable and essentially random), then the nodal lines will also be like random curves.  The principal investigator has shown that if one extends the modes of vibration into the complex domain (i.e. the world of complex numbers) then the physics conjectures are true.  The PI is now trying to prove the same along trajectories of the billiard balls. One also hopes to understand the ""critical points,"" i.e., the points where the drum vibrates to its top and bottom positions.  The same techniques apply to the much more abstruse physics of quantum gravity, and the principal investigator is collaborating with two physicists on that."

This viewpoint is forced on us if we want to study infinite finitely-generated groups without specifying a generating set, since the graphs that record each group's geometry are only mutually related by QIs.  In this project, the PI proposes to study group statistics that are large-scale but not invariant under quasi-isometry, and so may depend nontrivially on a choice of generating set.  This point of view facilitates the study of randomness and asymptotic density in groups.  The PI has studied free abelian groups and the discrete Heisenberg group in this way, opening up several avenues for current and future research.  Another object of particular interest is Teichmueller space, the parameter space for many kinds of geometric structures on surfaces.  The proposal contains descriptions of ongoing and planned work developing ideas for measuring ""typical'' geometric properties in Teichmueller space, the mapping class group, and the complex of curves using data that is destroyed by quasi-isometry.  For instance, one can show in this way that even though Teichmueller space is not a hyperbolic space, certain characteristics of hyperbolicity hold on average, or up to measure.  The techniques developed to study this space, which has many features of negative curvature but does not satisfy any of the usual curvature conditions, are promising for applicability in other settings, such as relatively hyperbolic groups.  A third main component of the proposal returns to the world of quasi-isometry invariants, developing new families of filling functions that appear to make finer geometric distinctions than some of their predecessors in the literature.<br/><br/>This project belongs to a world of ideas that has a growing number of practical applications.  For instance, it is useful in a wide range of applications (like communications networks) to have sparse but well-connected graphs.  In mathematics these are called expanders; the first families of examples came from Cayley graphs of groups, and later it was realized that randomization over regular graphs also produces good expanders with high probability.  Expansion constants, like a host of other geometric statistics, are ""fine"" and not QI invariant.  Generally, the question of understanding the nature of an object by randomly sampling its points appears across many areas of applied mathematics, and the topics in this proposal are clustered around this theme."

This famous conjecture was proved by S. T. Yau in 1976 when the first Chern class vanishes, and independently by Yau and Aubin for the case when the first Chern class is negative. When the first Chern class is positive, the corresponding Calabi conjecture is only solved in dimension 2, by G. Tian in 1989.  The higher dimensional case is largely open till this day.  There are substantial and major progress made in this important area of mathematics in recent years.  We propose to study a network of problems centered around the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics (a cousin of Kaehler Einstein metrics), stability of the underlying polarized Kaehler manifolds, and other related areas .  The principal investigator believes that we will see more breakthrough in near future.<br/><br/>The problem of the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics is the key problem in differential geometry.  It has strong impact to other fields of sciences, in particular, physics.  According to A. Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of space-time. Thus the research in Kaehler geometry is crucially important in physics and cosmology. The research proposed also has impact in string theory, in algebraic geometry as well as nonlinear analysis.  Progress in this proposed problems will be highly interesting to many different fields."

In informal terms, if a contract requires a miser to make payment with a tray of identical gold coins filling the tray as densely as possible, and if the contract stipulates the coins to be convex and centrally symmetric, then what shape of coin should the miser choose in order to part with as little gold as possible?  Reinhardt conjectured that the shape of the coin should be a smoothed octagon.  The smoothed octagon is constructed by taking a regular octagon and clipping the corners with hyperbolic arcs.  The density of the smoothed octagon is approximately 90 per cent.  Work by previous researchers on this conjecture has tended to focus on special cases. Research of the PI gives a general analysis of the problem.  It introduces a variational problem on the special linear group in two variables that captures the structure of the Reinhardt conjecture.  An interesting feature of this problem is that the conjectured solution is not analytic, but only satisfies a Lipschitz condition.  A second noteworthy feature of this problem is the presence of a nonlinear optimization problem in a finite number of variables, relating smoothed polygons to the conjecturally optimal smoothed octagon.  The PI has previously completed many calculations related to the proof of the Reinhardt conjecture and proposes to complete the proof of the Reinhardt conjecture.<br/><br/>This research will solve a conjecture made in 1934 by Reinhardt about  the convex shape in the plane whose optimal packing density is as small  as possible. The significance of this proposal is found in its broader  context.  Here, three important fields of mathematical inquiry are  brought to bear on a single problem: discrete geometry, nonsmooth  variational analysis, and global nonlinear optimization.  Problems concerning packings and density lie at the heart of discrete geometry  and are closely connected with problems of the same nature that  routinely arise in materials science.  Variational problems and more  generally control theory are have become indispensable tools in many  disciplines, ranging from mathematical finance to robotic control.   However, research that gives an exact nonsmooth solution is relatively  rare, and this feature gives this project special interest among  variational problem.  This research is also expected to further develop  methods that use computers to obtain exact global solutions to nonlinear  optimization problems.  Applications of nonlinear optimization are  abundant throughout science and arise naturally whenever a best choice  is sought among a system with finitely many parameters.  Methods that  use computers to find exact solutions thus have the potential of finding  widespread use.  Thus, by studying this particular packing problem,  mathematical tools may be further developed with promising prospects of  broad application throughout the sciences."

The proposal comprises several interconnected projects addressing these questions for certain classes of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and also for specific Hamiltonian systems such as magnetic flows. The PI will tackle these problems by employing methods from symplectic topology including Floer and quantum homological techniques, holomorphic curves, spectral invariants, Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory, as well as methods from differential geometry such as h-principles. The techniques utilized by the PI also have applications beyond the question of existence of infinitely many periodic orbits. In particular, the projects concerning the Poincaré recurrence, the Reeb flows and the coisotropic symplectic topology draw heavily on her recent works concerning periodic orbits. These projects have applications to measure-preserving and classical dynamical systems, and to some embedding problems in symplectic topology.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian systems constitute a broad class of physical systems where dissipative forces can be disregarded. For example, the planetary motion in celestial mechanics, the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid, and the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field are usually treated as Hamiltonian systems. One general, but not universal, feature of such systems is that they tend to have numerous periodic orbits. Corresponding to the cyclic motion, this is the simplest dynamical phenomenon after equilibrium, and an investigation of periodic orbits of a system is crucial in understanding its global behavior. To give but a few applications, the knowledge of periodic orbits is crucial in astronomy, fluid dynamics (e.g., statistics of turbulent flow) or can be used to understand stability of solutions for large times. In all but the simplest cases, establishing existence of periodic orbits often requires advanced and powerful mathematical tools. For a broad class of Hamiltonian systems, the number of periodic orbits is known to be infinite and this is thought to be the case for many, but not all, Hamiltonian systems.  The proposal focuses on the problem of existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for Hamiltonian dynamical systems in a variety of settings and on applications of the techniques used by the PI to attack this problem to some other related questions. The projects in the last part of the proposal concern a certain class of spaces which arise, for instance, in the study of Hamiltonian systems with symmetries. The proposed work is related to and has potential applications in mathematical physics, and geometric and quantum mechanics."

In three dimensions, the main open problems are the finiteness of the number of surgeries, the decay of the sectional curvature and the long-time asymptotics of the geometry.  In four dimensions, the goal is to use Ricci flow to identify canonical geometries. The second project concerns optimal transport.  We will work on a construction of parallel transport on the space of probability measures, equipped with the Wasserstein metric.  We will also work on isoperimetric inequalities and sharp Sobolev inequalities for metric-measure spaces with positive Ricci curvature. The third project will develop an index theorem for transverse Dirac-type operators on manifolds with Riemannian foliations.  The principal investigator will also develop a model of differential K-theory based on infinite-dimensional vector bundles.<br/><br/>Optimal transport is the study of the optimal way to transport mass. It was first considered by Monge in 1781.  In the past few decades, links have been established between optimal transport, partial differential equations and applied mathematics.  More recently, links have also been found with differential geometry. It seems likely that ideas from geometry will find applications to optimal transport.  The Ricci flow has clear importance for geometry and topology. The methods that are being proposed to study its long-term behavior, in particular the use of monotonic quantities adapted to collapsing flows, may well have application to other geometric flows."

The first broad area of the proposal centers on the study of singularities in  MCF, including estimates for the size of the singular sets, a compactness theorem for the possible types of singularities, a classification of generic singularities of the flow, and a canonical neighborhoods theorem that describes the flow in a neighborhood of the generic singularities.  These are the most important questions about singularities and the PI and his collaborator have already obtained significant results in this direction.  The second main area of the proposal concerns the structure of Einstein manifolds and, in particular, the question of when an Einstein manifold has a unique asymptotic structure (or tangent cone at infinity).  The main prior result in this direction is due to Cheeger and Tian in 1994, where they showed uniqueness under an integrability assumption that the PI would like to remove.  These sort of uniqueness questions have played an important role in a number of areas of geometric analysis and are extremely important in understanding the structure of the singular set for limits of Einstein manifolds.<br/><br/>This project focuses on several geometric variational problems.  The problems are mathematical, but many of them arose first in science and engineering.  Perhaps the most natural geometrically are minimal surfaces that locally minimize their surface area and, thus, model soap films in perfect equilibrium (so the film does not change other time). These have been studied at least since  Lagrange's 1762 memoir, but recent years have seen breakthroughs on many long-standing problems in the theory of minimal surfaces, with important contributions from many mathematicians.    There is a time-varying analog of this where a surface (which is not in equilibrium) evolves to minimize its surface area as quickly as possible; this is called mean curvature flow or MCF.  Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation  which is formally similar to the equation that governs the flow of heat in physics.  Clearly, minimal surfaces remain static under the MCF.  MCF and other geometric flows were   developed for their intrinsic beauty as well as their potential applications to other fields to model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in annealing metals, and crystal growth.  While key foundational results have been obtained, several of the most basic questions remain unanswered.  In contrast, the Einstein equation is a nonlinear differential equation for the curvature of a space (or a space-time in general relativity).  Hilbert realized a century ago that this comes up variationally as the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Einstein-Hilbert functional."

In recent work with M.Mirzakhani, the PI was able to prove some dynamical rigidity results for this action, which allow one to understand every (and not just almost every) orbit. This is important for several reasons. In particular, the surfaces which arise from billiards are a set of measure zero in the moduli space, and ergodic theorems which hold at every point are needed to prove results about billiards. Many of the results and techniques are based on a loose analogy with the theory of unipotent flows on locally symmetric spaces (e.g. Ratner's theorem).  However, the moduli spaces of differentials are substantially different, and new ideas were needed.   The PI proposes additional research in this direction.<br/><br/>Some natural phenomena are ``chaotic'' (i.e. unpredictable). These are often studied by statistical methods. Others are ``integrable'' (i.e. predictable and regular). Other phenomena fit somewhere in between. The polygonal billiard system, which is one of the main subjects of study of the proposal,  is a good model of intermediate behavior. As such it has been studied extensively in physics as well, in particular in connection to``quantum chaos''.

Second, she will work on classifying symplectic manifolds with ``large"" torus actions. More specifically, she will finish her project with Y. Karshon on n-1 dimensional torus actions on 2n dimensional manifolds, analyze Hamiltonian circle actions on six-manifolds, and find applications in both cases -- especially to Fano manifolds. Third, R. Goldin and S. Tolman  will generalize ideas from algebraic combinatorics to the more general symplectic setting of Hamiltonian actions on symplectic manifolds. In addition to these three main areas, she will work with her collaborators on a number of other projects: calculating the cohomology of the symplectic quotients of Hamiltonian loop group actions, and computing the  integer cohomology of symplectic manifolds and their quotients in the finite dimensional case. Taken together, these results will significantly advance our understanding of this field.<br/><br/>Consider a physical system,  such as a planet orbiting around a star. We need to keep track of the position and momentum of each object: The set of all possible measurements is called phase space. For the two-body system, the  phase space is twelve dimensional Euclidean space. Even for more complicated systems, the phase space looks locally like Euclidean space. Moreover, the rate of change over time of the momentum of an object is determined by the rate of change of the total energy of the system with respect to the position of that object; the converse also holds. Finally, many physical systems have symmetries.  For example, if we ignore any external gravitational field, the solar system has three-dimensional rotational symmetry. Prof. Tolman studies  a mathematical generalization of phase space, called ""symplectic manifolds.""  Her research focuses on understanding the role of symmetries on these spaces.  For example, she is studying when symplectic manifolds with symmetry are as well behaved as algebraic varieties, which are the spaces cut out by solutions to polynomial equations. Working with Prof. Karshon, she is trying to describe all symplectic manifolds with extremely large amounts of symmetry."

Generalized geometries form a class of almost complex manifolds with reduced structure groups, which have become of central importance to the study of realistic string theory models. These are natural generalizations of Calabi-Yau manifolds and are of mathematical interest in their own right. In one class important for string theory, the canonical structure one seeks on a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold is governed by a fully nonlinear complex Monge Ampere type system that couples a balanced Hermitian metric to an anti self-dual connection of a vector bundle. When the manifold is Kahler Calabi-Yau and the vector bundle is the tangent bundle, this system reduces to the Calabi conjecture for Ricci-flat metrics. Generalized geometries arise as the internal component of spacetime of string theory models that are much closer to our real world than previous constructions. The mathematics that governs such a geometry is a natural extension of deep problems in geometric analysis, algebraic geometry, and deformation theory. The physics that is behind the new geometry provides inspiration and novel approaches to posing and solving the mathematical problems.

The study of Lie groups in Geometry has a long history, developed by figures such as Sophus Lie, Felix Klein, Wilhelm Killing, Elie Cartan, Hermann Weyl, etc. In particular, Klein proposed that specifying an appropriate transformation group leaving certain geometric objects invariant, one would then observe various geometries. At the global level, whenever a Lie group acts on a geometric object, such as a Riemannian manifold, this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure in terms of its Representation Theory on tensors, cohomology groups, etc. The scientific focus of the conference is the interaction between Lie Group Theory, Geometry and Topology in the broadest possible sense. Topics to be touched upon in the conference will be: infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their applications to geometry and topology, infinite dimensional  representations as spaces of functions on a manifold, representation theory of Real Semisimple Lie Groups and Integrable Systems, actions of the mapping class group on the representation varieties of surface groups, special holonomy, proper affine actions on Minkowski space, Lie groups and their arithmetic subgroups, tessellations of homogeneous spaces, unipotent dynamics, etc.<br/><br/>The aim of the fourth Latin-American Congress on Lie Groups and Geometry is to disseminate the latest developments in the area to both senior and junior mathematicians. This meeting will bring together researchers from all over Latin-America, USA and Europe, working in diverse areas related by their use of Lie groups in their different facets, namely geometrical, topological, algebraic, etc. It will also raise awareness of the excellent academic work taking place in Latin America and provide a networking opportunity for researchers and students. Graduate students and postdocs will especially benefit from the interaction with the senior mathematicians. Researchers working in developing countries will have the chance to interact with their counterparts from the USA and Europe. https://sites.google.com/site/4liegroupsandgeometry/home"

The questions to be investigated are of pressing current interest in mathematics and physics.  The mathematical techniques under development could make it possible to exactly compute the predicted masses of particles in increasingly realistic string models, and better understand how the observed forces and interactions in nature can arise from grand unified theories which include quantum gravity. Ideas of string theory provide key insight which are expected to directly lead to the solution of several unsolved problems in three-dimensional algebraic geometry.

These are natural generalizations of Calabi-Yau manifolds and are of mathematical interest in their own right.

The PI will also study boundedness and monotonicity properties of positive solutions of semilinear elliptic pde's, especially in the so-called supercritical case. Global boundedness fails in general but the PI will attempt to show monotonicity of solutions in a uniform neighborhood of the boundary. He will also explore the closely related problem of uniform boundedness of semi-stable solutions.

Initial data sets for the Einstein field equation satisfy a nonlinear elliptic system of equations, the Einstein constraint equations.  The study of this system has proven to be interesting and fruitful for geometric analysis, and has shed light on the structure of the space of solutions to the Einstein field equation, which is of interest for physics.  In previous joint work with R. Schoen, the P.I. developed deformation and gluing techniques for the constraint operator which have been employed (by the P.I. and others) to construct interesting initial data sets, and have led to a better understanding of the structure of asymptotically flat solutions of the constraint equations.  Part of the project involves extending results on asymptotics and gluing, including construction of initial data modeling N-body configurations, to include certain matter models, and analyzing the extent to which some of the results that have been developed in the asymptotically flat setting can extend to the asymptotically hyperbolic case. The P.I. will also address several questions on the structure of small-data solutions of the constraints, and as well as on applications of localized scalar curvature deformation.  In a second part of the project, the P.I. will continue the study of a variational problem in Kahler and symplectic geometry, the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian problem, building on recent joint work with A. Butscher.  Another interesting variational problem, the isoperimetric problem (minimizing the area required to enclose a given volume), leads to questions on manifolds-with-density and on spaces relevant to general relativity amenable to research with undergraduates.  <br/><br/>Solutions to the Einstein field equations are used to model gravitational radiation, strong field phenomena like black holes, isolated gravitational systems, and the large-scale structure of the universe.  A more detailed understanding of the space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations would yield a better understanding of these models.  For instance, understanding the asymptotic structure of solutions to the constraints can yield information about models of gravitational radiation.  Analysis of the constraint system leads to the construction of initial data with interesting properties, such as solutions in which two or more isolated systems are fused together into a connected solution of the constraints.  It would be very interesting for the study of gravitational radiation to numerically implement constructions of small initial data with special asymptotics, and then numerically solve the Einstein field equations; similar comments apply to N-body configurations.  An important aspect of the project is to introduce undergraduates to the connections between geometry, analysis and physics. Students will undertake research with the PI during the summer (occurring simultaneously with the Lafayette REU Site program, further enriching the summer research environment in the department), and during the academic year students will be involved in course work, independent study, and research with the PI."

Mirror symmetry is a relatively new subject that has attracted a great deal of attention over the past two decades. Mirror symmetry has its roots in string theory and is the study of a duality between the complex and symplectic geometry of certain objects. The number of ways to approach the subject has grown vast over the years and today many researchers can be said to be studying a subject inspired in some way by mirror symmetry. The rapidly expanding field of mirror symmetry has inspired a great deal of the research in complex, algebraic and symplectic geometry over the past twenty years. These ideas--the algebraic and geometric theories inspired by mirror symmetry--form the scientific focus of the conference.<br/>Important innovations include Gromov-Witten invariants, Fukaya categories and tropical geometry. In addition, mirror symmetry has cast renewed attention on and greatly expanded the scope of existing disciplines--Floer theory, derived categories, and special Lagrangian geometry are a few examples. An explanation of mirror symmetry would not only provide a link between complex and symplectic geometry, but it would also have a deep impact on a wide range of current subjects.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed conference is to bring together researchers studying a wide range of aspects of mirror symmetry. The conference will lead to increased collaboration among researchers in the Midwest and special attention will be paid to recruiting participants from the Midwest to further this aim. An important additional point of the conference is to bring in experts from outside the region. The conference will attract a wide range of participants with a diversity of backgrounds. An essential feature of the conference will be education. A portion of the talks will constitute a ``mini-course'', aimed at graduate students and non-experts and intended to give an introduction to some aspect of the field. The goals of the mini-course are two fold: One, to open and facilitate lines of communication between researchers with different areas of expertise; and two, to get graduate students involved, excited and actively participating in the scientific activities of the conference. In addition to the impacts highlighted above--increasing collaboration among researchers in the Midwest and teaching graduate students and young researchers about the subject--it is hoped that the conference will lead to the founding of an annual Midwest mirror symmetry conference. Another intent of the the conference is to expand the regional ties between University of Wisconsin group of mathematicians working on the areas related to mirror symmetry and the M-Center (Mirror Symmetry Center) at Kansas State University. Mirror symmetry has its roots in high-energy physics and string theory and the mathematics involved has an impact on these sciences. To take advantage of these ties, the conference will feature physicists and mathematicians.<br/><br/>More information can be found on the conference website<br/>http://www.math.wisc.edu/~oh/uw-ksu-index.html"

For example, the functional determinant of an elliptic operator is a problem originating in spectral theory and mathematical physics, and the analysis of the particular problem  considered is a variational problem leading to a fourth order elliptic equation.  The associated Lagrangian is unbounded, and the existence of solutions and their qualitative properties is highly nontrivial.  Similar equations are used to model the properties of thin films.  Another problem proposed is the construction of Bach-flat metrics on four-manifolds using surgery methods.  The Bach tensor arises in general relativity and conformal geometry, and the Bach-flat condition is the Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional on the space of Riemannian metrics which is quadratic in the curvature, and can be viewed as a nonlinear system of partial differential equations with certain invariance properties.  The final set of problems we propose involves nonlinear equations arising in conformal geometry and the theory of optimal transportation.   We are specifically interested in the construction of singular solutions of these equations as a way to study the existence of complete Riemannian metrics with prescribed curvature conditions. <br/><br/><br/>The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be an important and highly active field of mathematical research. The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world, and differential geometry was developed to understand the geometry of curved spaces - for example, the curvature of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity. In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations. The research in this proposal involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study."

As an important evolutionary equation, it sets up a bridge between geometry and topology. In the past three decades, there have been many exciting achievements of the Ricci flow. In 2002, Perelman used the Ricci flow to solve the folklore Poincare conjecture. In 2007, Richard Schoen and Simon Brendle used the Ricci flow to prove the famous sphere theorem. These examples and many others highlight one fact that the Ricci flow is a powerful tool which deserves intensive study. The success of these previous examples is based on the knowledge of the global behavior of the Ricci flows with special conditions. Specially, either the dimension of the underlying manifold is three, or the curvature operator (or isotropic curvature) is nonnegative.  However, in a general higher dimensional Ricci flow, we can hardly determine the sign of the curvature operator. The global picture of the Ricci flow is still unclear. There remain a lot of technical  difficulties to overcome. Therefore, the study of the Ricci flows with weaker curvature constraints becomes natural and necessary. The Ricci flows' behavior under sectional curvature and Ricci curvature bounds have been solved by Hamilton and Sesum.  Naturally, the next step is to understand the behavior of the Ricci flow under the condition that scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. On the other hand, Perelman's fundamental work reveals that there are many Ricci flows where scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. Therefore, the Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature deserve comprehensive study. My research proposal is to study these Ricci flows.<br/><br/>The Ricci flow is an evolution equation solution on a Riemannian manifold. The Ricci flow is an important tool to find Einstein metrics, which are crucial in general relativity and mirror symmetry, my study is closely related to physics and Kahler geometry.  It naturally interacts with mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, complex analysis and partial differential equations.  Therefore, the study of the Ricci flow has broader impact outside the area of geometric analysis.  Among all Ricci flows, the Ricci flow with bounded scalar curvature is a very important type. This type of Ricci flows appear naturally in many settings. For example, according to the deep work of Perelman, the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded along the Ricci flows on many Kahler manifolds. My research proposal focuses on the study of the Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature. The success of this project will greatly benefit the understanding of properties of many Riemannian manifolds."

The first  problem involves a new geometric criterion for when a Coxeter group is a Kleinian group. Specifically, if the defining graph of a right-angled Coxeter group can be realized as the 1-skeleton of an acute triangulation of the 2-sphere, is the Coxeter group hyperbolic?  This relates the techniques of geometric group theory and classical 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to combinatorial problems concerning triangulations. As part of this study, the PI will investigate the moduli space of an acute triangulation of the 2-sphere.  In particular, is this space connected?  A second question asks when a group generated by reflections in hyperbolic 3-space contains a knot group.   This is deeply related to understanding commensurability of knot complements. More broadly, the PI seeks to address the conjecture that there are at most three hyperbolic knot complements in any given commensurability class.  Boileau, Boyer, Cebanu, and the PI have made significant progress on the conjecture in recent work, and this project aims to address the remaining case.  In a third project, the PI seeks a CAT(0) space for the group of outer automorphisms of the free product of four copies of the integers mod 2.  This group of outer automorphisms is particularly pleasing and related to the proposal as it is generated by involutions.<br/><br/>Groups generated by involutions have long been guiding examples in furthering the understanding of the geometry of groups.  They are inherently geometric and relevant to the modern theory of orbifolds. These groups have been studied in various ways by Coxeter, Thurston, Davis, and Moussong, as well as by many other celebrated mathematicians, and they continue to inform current research. Imposing some condition, such as the presence of a reflection, allows one to gain traction on a difficult problem and eventually see the whole picture.   The projects proposed here have potential impact in other fields.  For example, the study of triangulations, particularly acute triangulations, is important in computer-aided design and scientific computing."

In particular we hope to determine the graph with eight vertices representing the Thurston geometries, and edges representing a transition within projective geometry. Some of this discussion is most naturally done in the language of nonstandard analysis using infinitesimals.<br/> <br/>The study of geometrical properties of space in various dimensions forms the basis of Einstein's theory of relativity, and the physics of superstring theory. We experience the curvature of space as gravity. This is all based on Riemannian geometry which is a way to study different kinds of distance. On the other hand there is projective geometry. This  arose from the study of perspective developed by artists in the Renaissance and is based on the notion of straight line but without a notion of distance. This geometry is useful in computer graphics. Freeing oneself from length and distance introduces added flexibility. Recently there has been interest in developing this in the context of topology and applying it to theoretical physics."

Such models also arise in Epidemiology and Mathematical Finance. These models are diffusion-like processes, but with variables that are constrained to lie in certain regions of space, e.g. the non-negative orthant for a Finance problem, or a simplex for a Genetics problem. Hence the paths of these Markov processes must also remain within the feasible part of space.  This forces the generator to be an elliptic operator whose leading part degenerates along the boundary. A distinguishing feature of these processes is that, in the absence of an outside force, like mutation, a typical path reaches the boundary of the feasible region in finite time, but cannot cross it. This implies that the degeneracies are rather different from any that have heretofore been successfully analyzed. While a great deal is known about some classes of degenerate operators, very little is known either about the class of operators that arise here, or about degenerate PDEs on domains with boundaries as singular as that of a simplex or other polyhedra. A principal focus of Dr. Epstein's research is to understand the detailed analytic properties of the solutions to equations of this type. His recent work, with Rafe Mazzeo, establishes the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions for this natural class of equations, on a natural class of domains, and lays the foundation for a detailed study of the qualitative properties of these models. In applications one needs to solve equations that these  prior results show cannot have regular solutions. Thus Dr. Epstein will now turn his attention to the analysis of the singular solutions that arise in applications to Probability, Mathematical Finance and Population Biology, etc. Amongst other things, this will entail an elaboration of the functional analytic framework used to analyze regular solutions, to address the singularities that arise in these applications. Combining these analytic techniques with methods used in Probability Theory, he hopes to precisely describe the structure of the heat kernel itself near to time zero, and along the boundaries of the feasible region, where it can exhibit various types of singularities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Mathematical models for many problems in Population Biology, Epidemiology and Finance involve the time evolution of a collection of discrete variables under both random and deterministic forces. These variables are frequently constrained: for example a population with a given genotype, or the number of people infected with a pathogen must be a non-negative integer, and the value of a stock is usually assumed to be non-negative. The dynamical behavior of such models is often described by a Markov chain. These are discrete models with ""no history,"" meaning that the statistical properties of the current generation determine those of the next. Discrete models of this type are difficult to directly analyze, and so they are often replaced by continuum limits that are described by partial differential equations, which is also the language of classical and quantum physics. While much work has been done to study such models when there is a single variable, the purpose of this project is to develop analytic and computational tools to study the qualitative behavior of solutions to these equations when there are many, possibly interacting, variables. In applications to Population Genetics, such tools can be used to understand when random aspects of reproduction dominate the evolution of a population, and when deterministic forces like natural selection dominate. The investigator hopes to unravel the effects of fitness interactions among a small group mutations on the evolution of simple organisms. Similar methods could be applied to study the early stages of an epidemic, when it might be possible to make a small intervention that could control the growth of the infected population."

The conference will be focused on the moduli space of curves, broadly defined to include Teichmuller theory, cohomological topics surrounding the Mumford conjecture (Madsen-Weiss theorem) and the tautological ring, the mapping class group, and other related topics in algebraic geometry and geometric topology.  The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 47 times.  The conference has become an extremely successful semi-annual event in the Southwest.  The next series of conferences will have seven primary sponsoring universities:  Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Houston, Texas Tech University, Texas Christian University/University of Texas at Arlington (jointly).  The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states.  The conference is committed to bring researchers of national  and international stature to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states.  Summaries of talks with notation of important results are publicly reported.<br/><br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci.  First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding  states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates  productive cooperative efforts between schools.  Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.  In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees.  Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.  Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a pilot project to foster research opportunities for junior faculty.<br/><br/><br/>The permanent web page for the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference is here: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~tgtc/archive/."

In more details, research conducted by M. Kapovich concerns: (1) Geometry of buildings with applications to representation theory. Kapovich intends to continue his study of the geometry of the moduli spaces of polygonal linkages in symmetric spaces and buildings in relation to the algebraic groups. Part of this study is establishing tropical structures on Euclidean buildings. (2) Kleinian groups in higher dimensions: Kapovich will study finiteness properties of higher-dimensional Kleinian groups. (3) Fundamental groups of complex-projective varieties: Kapovich will study fundamental groups of irreducible complex-projective varieties whose singularities are normal crossings. (4) Kapovich will study embeddings of Right-angled Artin Groups in the group of di&#64256;eomorphisms of the circle. (5) Semihyperbolicity of Teichmuller space: Kapovich will study coarse nonpositive curvature properties of Teichmuller space. (6) Kapovich will study classification of fundamental groups of closed 4-dimensional manifolds M with trivial 2nd homotopy group.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand better interaction between geometry and groups. Groups appear naturally as symmetries of natural geometric objects. Simple examples of such symmetries come from wall-paper tilings (where geometry is Euclidean) or tilings appearing is some of the Escher pictures (hyperbolic geometry). Furthermore, groups appear as symmetries of geometric objects of physical nature, from elementary particles to the entire universe (treated as a geometric object). Algebra (group theory) allows one to encode the underlying symmetries, and, conversely, geometry allows one to approach successfully purely algebraic problems. One of the examples of such interaction  of seemingly different mathematical fields is project (3), which aims to apply groups of symmetries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space to complex-algebraic geometry (the latter deals with geometry of solution spaces of systems of polynomial equations with complex variables)."

Special emphasis will be devoted to the pursuit of global Riemannian geometry via additional structures.  This includes but is not limited to structures arising from the presence of symmetries, and to structures arising from taking external or internal limits. Our efforts concerning investigations of relations between curvature, symmetry and topology is guided by the so-called symmetry program initiated by the investigator and set forth by the aim: ""Classify or describe the structure of manifolds with positive or nonnegative curvature and large isometry groups"". This area has experienced significant advances in various directions during the past two decades with contributions from many people, resulting in a number of classification type theorems, the discovery of new structures and numerous examples in non-negative curvature and one in the illusive case of positive curvature. Most recently rigidity phenomena providing a link to Tits geometry of buildings has emerged. Here topology of buildings is introduced via the Hausdorff topology of so-called chamber systems. The main focus of the project will be to further develop this connection to buildings, but will also include investigations of structures arising from the collapse of manifolds under a lower curvature bound, and recent connections between comparison geometry and a new applied area concerned with the ""processing of manifold-valued data"". The latter also deals with averages via non-linear ""center of mass"" and taking internal limits.<br/><br/>The project deals with a vast and flexible extension of the classical rigid and maximally symmetric euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic geometries, as well as of the theory of surfaces. Finding and exhibiting relations between geometry and topology is at the heart of the subject. Here geometry refers to those properties of a space that are invariant under distance preserving transformations (called symmetries here), whereas topology refers to the more flexible properties of a space that are invariant under transformations such as stretching, bending and deforming. Curvature governs the local behavior of geodesics, i.e., of the ""straight lines"" in the space. By comparison, the angle sum of a geodesic triangle in a positively curved space is bigger than 180 degrees, which is the angle sum of a triangle in the flat Euclidean plane. This general type of geometry plays a vital role in much of mathematics, physics and more recently in applications to signal processing and more. Most of the proposed activity falls under the umbrella of the ""symmetry program"" designed by the investigator. The main specific goals within the next few years are on the one hand to find additional new examples of positively and nonnegatively curved manifolds, and at the opposite extreme to show that the so-called symmetric spaces indeed are rigid objects in a natural sense. The latter is based on a recently discovered link to a very different area, namely Tits geometry of buildings, an area that has had profound and diverse applications within mathematics. Other important goals include developing new directions in geometry motivated by the emerging field of processing of manifold-valued data to, e.g., computer vision, medical imagining, sensor networks, and statistical analysis of shapes."

Werner<br/><br/>These research projects are in asymptotic geometric analysis and affine convex geometry. A main emphasis of her research is on affine invariant and high dimensional objects and phenomena and on links with other areas of mathematics and mathematical sciences (probability, statistics, optimization, information theory and quantum information theory). Much of the research in convex geometry in recent years has been directed to the study of affine and high dimensional aspects of convex bodies. The PI and her collaborators carried out a systematic study of some of the most important affine invariant functionals on convex bodies, the p-affine surface areas.  They obtained extensions of those invariants to all convex bodies and for all p and established their corresponding affine isoperimetric inequalities (which are stronger than their Euclidean counterparts). There are numerous applications of these works. We only mention the PI's  work, with Reisner and Schuett, on Mahler's conjecture. While not providing the solution (yet), their result  is the strongest indication to date that the minimum is indeed  attained for polytopes. Very recent developments open totally new directions. For one, the PI found new affine invariants and proved that those and the p-affine surface areas are certain entropies from information  theory. In another direction, the PI, Artstein, Klartag and Schuett showed that affine isoperimetric inequality for log concave functions corresponds to a reverse log Sobolev inequality for entropy. These directions will be explored further. Contributions are also her work linking quantum information theory and high dimensional convex geometry, culminating in Aubrun's, Szarek's  and her analysis of the ""Additivity conjecture for Quantum channels"" via asymptotic geometric analysis. The PI will continue to exploit the unique perspective given by asymptotic geometric analysis for  problems in quantum information theory.<br/><br/>A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room, then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase, the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality."" However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases which are not visible in low dimensions.  We can  exploit those patters, thus taking advantage of  the ""curse of dimensionality"" to make it the ""blessing of dimensionality"". To study such high dimensional phenomena, is one purpose of this grant."

Kahler geometry is a branch of complex geometry which also has important ties to physics and many areas of modern geometry.

One of the goals of the research is to refine our understanding of the distributions of zeros and critical points of polynomials, holomorphic sections of ample line bundles, and entire functions.  A fundamental ingredient in the study of random sections is the Bergman-Szego kernel, and this project involves using curvature invariants to describe the off-diagonal asymptotics of this kernel for large powers of the line bundle.  Shiffman will apply the off-diagonal Bergman kernel asymptotics to obtain optimal sup-norms for orthonormal bases of spaces of holomorphic sections of powers of ample line bundles.  He will also continue his investigation of the distribution of random zeros of systems of polynomials, or more generally random sections, in order to obtain central limit theorems for the numbers of zeros in smooth domains as the degree increases.  He will investigate the zeros of random polynomials of increasing degree containing a fixed number of monomial terms.  Shiffman will also study point processes given by critical points of random holomorphic sections.<br/><br/>In the physical sciences it is often necessary to handle disorder, where a certain amount of randomness is inserted into a system.  Random functions can be used to model many systems, such as systems of atoms and molecules and their component particles--protons, neutrons, and electrons.  Quantum mechanics describes these particles by wave functions, which are solutions of Schrodinger's equation.  The zeros and local maxima of wave functions give important information on states of atoms and molecules; the zeros are known in quantum chemistry and physics as nodal lines.  Polynomials in several variables can be used to study systems with several degrees of freedom, and those polynomials of high degree correspond to wave functions for high energy states.  The mathematics of point processes--the spatial and/or time distribution of random occurrences--has been used in many diverse fields such as signal and image processing, quantum mechanics, epidemiology, seismology, astronomy, and economics. This mathematics research project includes the development of geometric methods to study the statistics of point processes arising from mathematical equations with some random input."

The first specific class of projects involves continuing work with Thierry De Pauw (Paris VI) concerning the study of chains, cochains, charges, and the higher dimensional calculus of variations in general metric spaces with general coefficient groups. We consider a variety of mass-type functionals and the notion of a flat chain which generalizes the finite mass metric-space currents of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and the rectifiable and flat Euclidean-space G-chains of B.White and Fleming, Homology theories defined with such chains give an interplay between the topology and geometry of a metric spaces. For example, preliminary work as shown how Lipschitz path connectedness or the existence of finite mass spanning surfaces may be characterized by a suitable 0 and 1 dimensional flat homology groups. Variational cohomology may be treated by charges, which are cochains dual to normal currents, suitably topologized, and which often admit representation by pairs of continuous forms. Second we are continuing work with T. Riviere (ETH), on relations between various energies of maps between Riemannian manifolds and the homotopy classes of the maps. Following our recent work, we will consider energies given by integrating powers of the norm of the differential, the Hessian, etc. A key general question for critical dimensions is the minimum energy required to produce maps with a given nontrivial topology, in particular, how this minimum grows asymptotically as the topology degenerates. There are interesting concrete problems here for the rational homotopy of 4 manifolds. Third,with Betul Orcan (Rice) we propose to initiate work on geometric structures arising in geometric measure theory from stochastic variational problems with noisy data or noisy dependence on data. The work should be based on quantitative low regularity results and quantitatively described probable higher regularity for most data.<br/><br/><br/>Solutions to many variational problems in both pure and applied mathematics often are forced to have singularities, that is, to involve regions where large oscillations occur. For example among the many classes of liquid crystals, the optical axis may be forced to oscillate rapidly near points or along curves or along walls between regions. Our research proposes to understand the relationship between energies in such variational problems and the topological barriers imposed by the physics of the problems. Geometric constraints which occur naturally in many physical problems have led to new mathematical issues, and we need to use the full language of geometric measure theory to have sufficiently general geometric structures and objects to treat these issues. Also in applications, the presence of impurities in materials or of noise in measurements and data acquisition is important to consider. So it would be quite useful to develop mathematical tools to incorporate noise and stochastic considerations with the geometric structures. Two particular problems that we propose studying involve flow problems in image processing and the growth of higher dimensional ramified structures in biology with noisy data."

Open mirror symmetry is this duality in the open string sector, which involves mathematical theories especially associated to open strings. This project studies open mirror symmetry from both enumerative and categorical aspects. In the enumerative aspect, the PI proposes to investigate and prove the enumerative prediction (remodeling conjecture) from mirror symmetry for toric Calabi-Yaus in a multi-step project, including the cases of toric orbifolds. The remodeling conjecture uses a recursive relation to predict higher genus topological string amplitudes. When applied to orbifolds, this conjecture predicts Gromov-Witten potential currently unknown by other methods, such as topological vertex. As for the categorical aspect, this project continues the PI and collaborators' previous work on Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry (HMS), especially around T-duality and coherent-constructible correspondence (CCC) that PI et. al. construct. In particular, the PI plans to construct a geometric T-duality procedure for arbitrary vector bundles on toric varieties and toric normal crossings, and prove this procedure is consistent with the CCC, which is combinatorial in nature. In the interplay of these two aspects, the calculation of disk invariants is an essential ingredient in explicitly studying HMS with obstructed Lagragians, such as HMS for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, which this project also plans to address.<br/><br/>String theory is a candidate physics theory to describe all known fundamental forces. It requires sophisticated mathematics, and vice-versa, string theory has a long-lasting and deep influence on modern mathematics. There are several seemingly different set-ups of string theories ? if string theory wants to be the theory of this universe, there cannot be several different theories ? fortunately furthermore there are string dualities relating them. It turns out that these different set-ups are equivalent, and there is essentially a single string theory. Mirror symmetry is one of these dualities that equates two types of set-ups (IIA and IIB). In mathematics, this translates into beautiful and unforeseen connections between two vastly distinct areas of geometry. This project studies several mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry among toric varieties, a kind of spaces that serve as a simplified model of the extra-dimension in string physics. It contributes to the basic understanding of relevant mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, and also provides a concrete approach to a more complicated string theory from an equivalent-but-easier way."

The geometry of the Lagrangian subvarieties of a symplectic manifold has been the subject of a great deal of current research.  One version of this is a construction by Weinstein of the symplectic ``category''  whose objects are symplectic manifolds and whose morphisms are Lagrangian subvarieties.   A recent monograph by Guillemin and Sternberg shows that Weinstein's category and variants of it are powerful tools in semi-classical analysis.  We show hints that this category reveals symmetries in semiclassical systems which are not apparent in the underlying symplectic manifold.  This may be a semiclassical version of a principle advocated by Witten, that a quantum system may be have much more symmetry than the underlying symplectic manifold. Another area we propose investigating is the relation between symplectic geometry and quantum manifold invariants.  Many topological quantum field theories may be interpreted mathematically as counts of points in moduli spaces. One major exception seemed to be Chern-Simons gauge theory; in Physics language, this theory is not supersymmetric. Recent work in Physics (due to Beasley-Witten, Kapustin-Willett-Yaakov, Kallen, and others) has shows that Chern Simons Gauge theory has supersymmetric avatars.  We use this insight to conjecture formulas for quantum manifold invariants which may give more insight into their topological nature.  We also speculate on other possibilities raised by these constructions.<br/><br/>The interplay of ideas from Mathematics and Theoretical Physics has been a productive one for both fields. This project develops new perspectives on the relations between these two areas.  The planned project would give both concrete mathematical results and, hopefully, new avenues of interaction between the two fields.  More broadly, problems arising from Physics, and the Mathematics arising from grappling with these problems, have been at the core of Mathematics for centuries.  Quantum Field Theory and String Theory show every promise of playing a similar role in the future, and stimulating new discoveries in Mathematics, which invariably lead to applications far removed from their area of origin."

The primary goal of this project is to determine structure in the group of smooth concordance classes of topologically slice knots.  Using grid diagrams, the principal investigator will work to find a refinement of knot Floer homology which hopefully reflects the non-commutative structure of the fundamental group of the knot exterior.  From this refinement, the principal investigator hopes to garner further concordance invariants and apply them to study topologically slice knots.  This refinement of knot Floer homology is expected to capture some of the information in the higher-order Alexander modules.  The final goal of the project is to develop computational techniques for these modules.<br/><br/>The principal investigator hopes to shed light on the structure of knotted curves in space.  Knots appear many places in nature.  For example, the strands of DNA in cells are knotted, and these knots can affect the replication process.  Many of the existing algebraic tools used to study knots are commutative.  The principal investigator will develop new non-commutative algebraic tools to study knots and will develop techniques for making computations.  By using more general, non-commutative algebraic techniques, the principal investigator hopes to reveal more structure in the set of knots in space."
