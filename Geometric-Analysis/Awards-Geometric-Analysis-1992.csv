The persistence theorem is studied in                 the context of reaction-diffusion equations and functional                      differential equations.                                                              The chemostat is a laboratory apparatus that is used                       in ecology to study exploitative competition.  (It is a model of                a simple lake.)  It is one place where both the mathematics and                 the biological experiments are tractable; all the parameters                    needed for the equations of the mathematical model are measurable               in the laboratory.  The basic model does not allow for the delat                between nutrient uptake by the organisms in the chemostat                       and reproduction (cell division).  A standard assumption in the                 model is that the tank is well stirred; hence there are                         differences in the amounts of nutrient present in different parts               of the tank. To study the effect of a nutrient gradient, another                device called the gradostat has been proposed by biologists.  The               mathematics of that device is now fairly well understood.                       Another way to induce a gradient is to allow the nutrient to                    enter the tank at one point and to diffuse along with the                       organisms.  The notion of persistence tries to capture the                      ecological idea that all components of a model ecosystem survive.               Such theorems have proved useful in the context of ordinary                     differential equation models; e.g., in the analysis of the                      gradostat and of a chemostat with an inhibitor.  The concept has                now found its way into the mathematical literature in a general                 form, in particular for an asymptotically smooth semi-dynamical                 system.  The aim of this project is to use the full potential of                the persistence theorem by applying it in an infinite dimensional               context, to reaction-diffusion equations and differential                       equations with delays.  If the assumptions about the chemostat                  are changed to remove the well-stirred hypothesis and to let the                nutrient and the cells move by diffusion or convection, then a                  reaction-diffusion equation or a gradostat results.  Delayed                    chemostat models have been studied, but no physiological                        mechanism has been introduced to account for the delay.  The                    obvious mechanism is the cell cycle, the time between nutrient                  uptake and cell division."

The research will involve the study of certain newly discovered                 functionals which are related to mixed volumes.                                      This award will support research in the general area of                    integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed                  and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The                    geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to                       describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the                    reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire               set from the geometry of the slices. One well know application of               this area of mathematics is the CAT scan."

There is a long tradition of mathematicians involving                      themselves in the problems of physics, often to the mutual                      enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve physical             problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                  become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum                invariants of 3-manifolds is similar.  Mathematicians interesting               themselves in problems of quantum field theory were led to a                    certain geometric construction.  The construction led in turn to an             invariant that depended only on the topological character and not               the full geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are             now variations on the original construction and numerous resulting              quantum invariants.  Their origin is sufficiently different from                that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected             to detect things the traditional invariants cannot.  It now                     behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the             different quantum invariants and their relationships to more                    traditional invariants."

The work follows two main                      themes.  The first is concerned with the spectrum of the Laplace                operator on compact manifolds and boundary value problems for the               scalar curvature equation.  The main thrust of the research is                  the formulation and resolution of the Yamabe problem for                        manifolds with boundary.  The problem has been solved for                       manifolds without boundary; the presence of a boundary requires a               much more imaginative approach.  At this time, the formulation of               the correct questions is only being developed.  Good results in                 3, 4 and 5 dimensions have been obtained in the case of                         Riemannian manifolds. Work with a more geometric flavor will be                 done on                                                                         uniqueness questions for conformal deformation of metrics.  This                will extend a recent generalization of the theorem that any                     Riemannian manifold which supports a function whose Hessian is a                multiple of the metric and whose normal derivative vanishes on                  the boundary, must in fact be the upper hemisphere of the                       standard sphere.                                                                     Partial differential equations form the backbone of modern                 differential geometry.  Phenomena which involve continuous change               such as that seen in motion, curvature and higher dimensional                   analogues are known to obey certain general laws, expressible in                terms of the interactions and relationships between partial                     derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not to state the                   relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative and                           quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for                         expressing solutions."

This research, in the general area of geometry, involves the               behavior of waves and wave fronts together with the spectral                    problems motivated by solid-state physics and noncommutative                    geometry."

The main emphasis will be the application of the methods               of algebraic topology (secondary characteristic classes) and                    spectral geometry.  Work will be done investigating the index and               spectrum of transversal Dirac operators on a foliated space,                    associated Cheeger-Chern-Simons classes, eta invariant and                      families of transversal Dirac operators parametrized by suitable                moduli spaces.  Applications to mathematical physics, in                        particular to gauge theory on foliated spaces, and global                       chiral anomalies will be further pursued.  The overall objective                of the project is to establish via heat equation methods and the                theory of spectral asymptotics on singular spaces, an index                     theorem for transversally elliptic operators on the basic section               of a Riemannian Foliation.  The main requirement is that the                    theorem and its extensions would be explicitly given in terms of                data relative to the transversal geometry of the foliation and of               the spectral properties of the associated zeta-function.

On the                     layers it is possible to analyze many operators using analogues                 of some of the fundamental tools applied to the study of                        differential equations."
