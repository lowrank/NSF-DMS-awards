Surfaces often appear when we study the geometry of a system; for instance, the set of configurations of a mechanical system or the underlying template for a large dimensional data set. Braids occur whenever we have a collection of points moving in a surface, for instance stars and planets moving within our field of vision, or the roots of polynomials changing with respect to a parameter. In order to understand these phenomena, it is essential to study the set of symmetries of a surface, which is also known as the mapping class group of the surface. This is a  beautiful and rich theory that has been the focus of intense study over the past century. The goal of this research is to study surfaces, braids, and polynomials, and the interactions of these objects with each other. One project is to give fast algorithms for deciding basic properties of elements of the mapping class group. One of the properties that the algorithm computes is the entropy, which determines the amount of mixing happening on the surface. In addition to these research goals, the PI plans to continue work on several projects that have direct impact on graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The first is the highly successful Topology Students Workshop, a conference that serves both as a research conference in topology for graduate students as well as a professional development workshop. The second is a free, online, interactive textbook for basic linear algebra, called Interactive Linear Algebra. The PI also plans to expand outreach activities to local K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>The PI will study Thurston maps, braid groups, and mapping class groups. A Thurston map is a branched cover of the complex plane (or Riemann sphere) over itself, with finite post-critical set. Many polynomials are Thurston maps. A basic recognition problem in complex dynamics is: given a Thurston map, is it equivalent to a polynomial, and if so, which one? In prior work, the PI and his collaborators gave a new, geometric algorithm to solve this recognition problem. The PI plans to investigate new, structural descriptions of the universe of such recognition problems. Specifically, the project will establish a version of the Bestvina-Handel algorithm from the theory of mapping class groups that is adapted to the setting of Thurston maps. The project will also provide a version of the Birman exact sequence (again from the theory of mapping class groups). One project in the theory of mapping class groups is to give a quadratic time algorithm that takes as input a product of generators of the mapping class group  and determines the Nielsen-Thurston type of that product. This algorithm also produces finer information about the product of generators, such as reducing curves and entropy. A third project is to classify homomorphisms between braid groups. The main new tool is the theory of totally symmetric sets, developed by the PI and his collaborators. By classifying these homomorphisms we gain insight into the relationships between polynomials of different degrees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These types of surfaces have always been important topics in geometry and general relativity, and have also inspired advances of many other subjects in mathematics and science. Geometric Variational Theory is the major method for proving the existence of these types of surfaces. In this research program, the PI will conduct a number of research projects on the existence of minimal, CMC, and PMC surfaces by further advancing Geometric Variational Theory. This research program also includes support for educational activities. The PI will develop new curricula for graduate research topic courses, recruit and mentor Ph.

The PI will also organize a summer workshop for graduate students and junior postdocs on topics related to this research program. The goal is to promote early career researchers and encourage collaborations.<br/><br/>In the first subject, the PI will explore important applications of the recent resolution of the Multiplicity One Conjecture. In particular, the PI will investigate new ergodic properties of minimal surfaces, and the Multiplicity One Conjecture in the Simon-Smith setting and the free boundary setting.  In the second subject, the PI will continue the research on Geometric Variational Theory with Lagrange multipliers. The PI anticipates to prove topological bounds for the min-max CMC surfaces in three manifolds, as well as to prove the existence of multiple CMC surfaces. PI also intends to establish the general existence theory for capillary surfaces.

This conference will feature some of the most renowned researchers in the interplay between geometry and partial differential equations who will present the state of the art of the various topics covered. The potential benefits for young researchers and researchers in nearby fields will be central; it is expected that these researchers will discover important techniques and perspectives. The project will support the transportation and accommodation of speakers and participants to the conference, with emphasis on graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty from American universities.<br/><br/>Within the general field of geometric analysis, the conference will focus on microlocal analysis, gauge theory, conformal invariants, analysis on non-compact manifolds including the study of index theory and de Rham cohomologies as well as wave propagation, and the study of geometric flows. These topics are chosen because of many recent advances and numerous open frontiers, and because in spite of many connections between them, there is sufficient distance between these topics that collaborative projects, benefiting from different points of view, are particularly fruitful. A key goal of the conference is to show young researchers, such as graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, the variety of areas in which microlocal analysis is a useful tool, with the expectation that they might be able to start collaborative projects in these areas.

In the second half of 20th century, KAM theory and the work of its founders (Kolmogorov, Arnold, Moser) gave a  new perspective on integrability problems and stimulated further progress in this area. New powerful methods, based on the interplay between a priori disconnected branches of mathematics and physics, have been recently developed:  methods of complex analysis, symplectic and complex geometry, Lie theory, representation theory, and computer algebra - they are all used in the integrability theory. As a result,  new integrable systems have been found, new applications of integrable systems in physics and geometry were discovered, new tools for the study of integrable systems were developed and  many questions, open for a long time, have been answered.

The benefits have been bidirectional in both cases: conformal geometry has led to the development of new analytic tools infused by geometric intuitions, which in turn lead to the solution of important geometric problems. Similarly, physics is a source both of new problems and of important insights, while conformal geometry provides crucial tools in the solution of physical problems. This conference will bring together experts from all of these fields to share and discuss their research and benefit from each other's perspectives and tools. It is expected that the conference will stimulate further development in all three fields and cooperation across many kinds of boundaries. Facilitating entry of early-career researchers into dialog with all three areas is a particular goal for this event. A poster session will be held for students.<br/><br/>Conformal geometry is the geometry of spaces where angles are defined, but not lengths. It has had a long and, recently, fast-growing relevance in physics, where it is a tool that provides new perspectives on many old phenomena. Conversely, physics has been a rich source of insights and problems in conformal geometry. For many years now, conformal geometry itself has provided some of the most compelling problems in geometric analysis, while techniques from analysis, scattering theory, and partial differential equations have enabled tremendous progress in the field. The primary goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from the three title areas whose work overlaps, in order to disseminate progress, share interesting problems, build relationships, and broaden perspectives. The conference will allow exposure to relevant state-of-the-art techniques in conformal geometry, analysis, and physics to be shared with other interested practitioners in each field. It will foster international collaboration between the US and other countries, and also collaboration between mathematicians and physicists. Junior participants will gain valuable insights, and relationships with more senior practitioners that may shape both their career and their mathematical (or physical) perspectives.

Symmetries are transformations that keep a geometric object invariant, that is, unchanged.  Many biological, chemical, physical, and man-made structures exhibit symmetries as fundamental design principles or essential aspects of their functioning.  In geometry, the Erlangen program set forward by Felix Klein in 1872 clearly identified the importance of symmetry and invariants in the geometrical study of manifolds.  Symmetry group methods are among the most powerful techniques available for finding closed-form solutions to nonlinear differential equations appearing in physics, engineering, and economics. Symmetries are essential in our understanding of conservation laws in physics and occur in a wide variety of modern applications including computer vision, automatic assembly of broken objects such as eggshells, pottery, and bones, and more.<br/><br/>One of the central themes of the conference is the application of Lie point symmetries and their extensions to obtain closed-form solutions of differential, finite difference, differential-difference, integro-differential, stochastic, and fractional differential equations. This theme intertwines with the investigation of differential, integral, and joint invariants together with their applications in general relativity, computer vision, automated assembly problems, geometric numerical integration, and other fields. These invariants can be computed using the method of moving frames where the recurrence relations unlock the structure of the algebra of invariants.  Moving frames play a crucial role in solving equivalence problems and studying geometric spaces, invariant geometric flows, and integrable systems.<br/><br/>Conference website: https://www.math.mun.ca/movingframes2022/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Euclidean geometry has applications to computer science and crystallography, as well as various branches of modern mathematics. The other two geometries are Spherical and Hyperbolic. Spherical geometry is central to the study of geophysics and astronomy, and vital for navigation. Hyperbolic geometry has modern applications to the theory of special relativity in Physics. Global Riemannian Geometry generalizes these three geometries. One of the major challenges in this area of study is to understand how local geometric invariants such as curvature, that is, how the space under consideration ""bends"",  relate to global topological invariants such as fundamental group, which indicates whether or not the space has 1-dimensional ""holes"". Manifolds with curvature bounds have been studied intensively since the conception of global Riemannian geometry. One relatively recent approach to the study of manifolds with lower curvature bounds has been the introduction of symmetries and is the main focus of this project. The project will also continue the PI's outreach work with middle and high school students, as well as graduate training, and the organization of workshops and conferences with an emphasis on the inclusion of women and under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The project will pursue a program in which she carefully studies and analyzes symmetries of  Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bounds, considering sectional, Ricci, scalar, and intermediate scalar curvature lower bounds and some of their corresponding generalizations to Alexandrov spaces, with an eye to gaining a deeper understanding of this largely unknown class of spaces. The project will study not only how continuous and discrete symmetries relate to the topology of such spaces, but also aim to find new examples of Riemannian manifolds of positive Ricci curvature and almost non-negative sectional curvature using symmetries and topology as tools to do so.  The project also includes training and mentoring of students as well as conference and workshop organization with an emphasis on inclusivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims at enhancing our knowledge in mathematics as well as in physics. The new insights and methods from this project will also be important to solve other structurally similar PDE. These PDE are at the heart of models in science and technology, from physics to biology and chemistry to finance, economics or medicine and psychology. Independent from their roots in various applications, these PDE and their solutions frequently exhibit similar interesting structures that are investigated by mathematical methods from geometric analysis. Consequently, mathematical results in one direction may open doors to solving problems in entirely different fields or applications. One main research  direction of the project concerns the Einstein equations from general relativity theory, which are the laws of the universe, linking its physical content to geometry. This theory is also crucial to make GPS work. Investigating these equations will increase our understanding of the universe both in the large as well as in smaller regions such as galaxies, binary neutron stars or binary black holes. Beyond that, this project will not only answer open questions in physics, but also create new ideas for physical models. When two massive objects like neutron stars or black holes merge, then gravitational waves are produced and travel from the source through the universe as ripples in spacetime. For the first time, such waves were observed in 2015 by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), marking the beginning of a new era where information from distant regions of the universe is decoded directly from the universe itself (different from telescopes). Unraveling the new structures will rely on synergies between mathematics, astrophysics and physics. The project will build on the PI?s prior results to develop new methods to achieve these goals. The project will also have direct impact in a broader sense via teaching and outreach activities. The PI will train students and postdocs in these fields, and through broad outreach activities also the public including underrepresented groups. The PI will attend conferences to communicate the results. The PI will also make the results available via the internet and publications.  <br/><br/>In this project the PI will develop new mathematical methods to investigate the Einstein equations and other nonlinear PDE describing physical phenomena. The PI will investigate: (1) the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations focusing on (I) spacetimes with radiation, and (II) the formation of black holes in GR when the Einstein equations are coupled to matter systems, (2) the mathematics of gravitational waves, their memory and related effects in GR as well as analogs of memory in other physical theories, (3) Euler equations and other PDE. These main directions comprise several projects. Many of them will rely on the PI's former results but also require new ideas and new mathematical methods. The PI's recent results for the Einstein equations in vacuum and with neutrino radiation revealed a panorama of new structures in gravitational radiation and memory that are expected to be seen in current and future gravitational wave detectors. Parts of the planned research link the mathematical insights to experiments (LIGO/VIRGO in particular). Moreover, the gravitational wave memory is expected to be detected in the near future. The PI and D. Garfinkle derived two analogs of memory within the electromagnetic theory. These are expected to be measured in an experiment as well. The mathematical methods are widely applicable to a broad spectrum of problems from mathematics to physics. The PI and collaborators will continue their research to complete the understanding of gravitational radiation and memory in GR, and to extend their research to other physical theories. The PI's research on the mathematical investigation of the Einstein equations in GR provides geometric-analytic methods to tackle other PDE. Moreover, newly found structures will be important in geometry as well as in PDE theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A mathematical space can be characterized by both local and global information, such as how curved it is (local) and how connected it is (global). As a subfield, symplectic geometry studies a special kind of space called a symplectic manifold. These spaces are all the same locally but can have a variety of global shapes. The main tools of study fall into two categories: algebraic and analytic. The algebraic tools are the frameworks of wrapping up global information and making calculations, while the analytic tools are techniques for solving differential equations and for constructing the algebraic frameworks. This research project aims to improve existing techniques and develop new tools to solve longstanding difficult questions, with emphasis on analytic methods. At the same time, the project will enrich the K-12 outreach (Math Circle) program at Texas A&M University, build a community of researchers in Texas and Central South America, and enhance connections among mathematics faculty and students. <br/><br/>On the technical level, the project involves three topics. First, using the technique of virtual cycle and adiabatic limit, the research aims to establish the relationship between Witten's gauged linear sigma model and the nonlinear sigma model. In contrast to many algebraic approaches, the method is analytic, allowing one to extend to the open-string case where algebraic methods are not yet available. Second, using a new method, the PI plans to prove compactness results in situations where traditional approaches do not apply. This includes a compactness result in Atiyah-Floer conjecture, compactness for pseudoholomorphic curves regarding reversed surgery for cleanly-intersecting Lagrangian submanifolds, and compactness for pseudoholomorphic curves with certain singular Lagrangian boundary conditions. Third, the project aims to develop a new counting method to define Gromov-Witten invariants and Floer homology over integers.

Three-dimensional objects, too, typically come in one of a few flavors, including Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic, plus a few others. In both two and three dimensions, the hyperbolic geometries are the most common and currently the most studied. This project is concerned with the geometry of 3-dimensional hyperbolic spaces. Its broad aim is to build complete models of the geometry from fundamental building blocks, completing a long line of inquiry in the subject. In addition to its core research objectives, the project serves the profession and the advancement of science through plans for continued mentoring of students, advocacy for underrepresented groups, and several outreach and service activities.<br/> <br/>The project is concerned with the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and their deformations. The project is centered on a study of Thurston's skinning map, which is a holomorphic function on the Teichmüller space associated to a hyperbolic 3-manifold of infinite volume. The size and shape of the image of this map has implications for the underlying geometry of the hyperbolic manifold, and the project aims to bound the size of the image in terms of the topology of the underlying manifold's boundary, without any dependence on the topology of the underlying manifold. Using this, the project aims to construct uniform models of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The techniques involved in the approach are of wider interest, and the project aims to use these techniques to establish new theorems on the geometric inflexibility of hyperbolic manifolds. The project also aims to establish new universal hyperbolic Dehn filling theorems.

The usual direction is to study the set of symmetries of a geometric object of interest.  In geometric group theory, this becomes a two-way street in that algebraic objects (such as groups) are considered as geometric objects in their own right. Hyperbolic geometry is a subject going back to work of Bolyai, Gauss and others in the 19th Century, but it also plays a central role in modern geometry, due to the influence of Thurston and Gromov.  This project centers around a central question in geometric group theory, the Cannon Conjecture, about the difference (in three dimensions) between classical hyperbolic geometry and the coarse notion due to Gromov, in the presence of a large group of symmetries. Broader impacts of this project include research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Over the last decade the principal investigator, along with Manning and others, has developed many tools involving relatively hyperbolic Dehn filling, which gives strong control on certain kinds of quotients of relatively hyperbolic groups.  This project leverages this work to study hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups whose boundary at infinity is a two-sphere.  The Cannon Conjecture predicts that such groups are virtually Kleinian groups.  This project proposes various approaches to this and related conjectures.  With Haissinsky, Manning, Osajda, Sisto and Walsh, the PI continues to develop a theory of drilling hyperbolic groups with two-sphere boundary.  The PI will investigate possible quasi-isometries between hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups with 2-sphere boundaries.  With Wilton, the PI will develop a notion of coarse sectional curvature, with applications to coherence and local quasi-convexity of certain hyperbolic groups.

Ricci flows have gained increasing interest, as they have been used to prove various longstanding conjectures, such as the Poincaré and Geometrization Conjectures, as well as the Generalized Smale Conjecture in dimension 3. The general expectation is that a Ricci flow produces a geometry in the limit that is in some sense inherent to the topology, that is, the loose makeup, of the underlying space. However, usually a Ricci flow incurs complicated singularities in finite time. In dimension 3, these singularities can be removed manually by a so-called surgery construction and the flow can be continued beyond them. The long-term goal of this project is to generalize this surgery construction to dimension 4, and possibly higher. To achieve this, the PI will study the singularity formation of higher dimensional Ricci flows, using a new theory he recently found. A successful construction in dimension 4 may have interesting topological and geometric applications. The PI will also further study Ricci flows with surgery, and the closely related ""Ricci flows through singularities,"" in dimension 3 and find further geometric and topological applications. The award provides funds for graduate students to engage in research related to the project.<br/><br/>The research project is split into two parts. The first project is a continuation of the PI's recently obtained compactness and partial regularity theory for Ricci flows in higher dimensions. The goal of the project is to use this new theory to construct a ""Ricci flow with surgery'"" or ""Ricci flow through singularities"" in dimension 4, generalizing the analogous construction in dimension 3. The strategy for achieving this is to deduce spatial asymptotic estimates on blow-up limits and use these to obtain a qualitative picture of the singularity formation. Based on this picture, the next step is to remove singularities via cylindrical and conical surgery constructions. The project also aims to characterize the long-time asymptotics of the flow. A successful construction and analysis may lead to several interesting topological and geometric applications. The second project continues work of the PI and collaborator on the uniqueness and continuous dependence of 3-dimensional singular Ricci flows through singularities. Previous work used this continuous dependence to resolve the Generalized Smale Conjecture (which classifies diffeomorphism groups of certain 3-manifolds up to homotopy) and a conjecture regarding the space of metrics with positive scalar curvature on 3-manifolds. This project will study more deeply the techniques used in these proofs, which have the potential to produce further results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes they are technical obstacles to overcome, while in other cases they encode essential features of the problem being considered. In this research  the focus is on singularities of minimal submanifolds and of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. Minimal submanifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of minimal surfaces, which model soap films. Their study is very classical, but some basic questions remain unanswered about their behavior near singularities. Special Lagrangian submanifolds are a particular kind of minimal submanifolds, which have received a great deal of attention recently due to their appearance in string theory. The Lagrangian mean curvature flow is a natural evolution process by which we can attempt to find special Lagrangian submanifolds, however once again the appearance of singularities is the basic difficulty. This research project aims to understand some common features of singularities which appear in families, in contrast with most previous research that focused on isolated singularities. Progress on this problem will have applications to many other related questions in geometry and analysis. The project also includes several educational activities aimed at increasing interest and success in STEM fields at all levels. Specifically, the educational activities include: a week long summer math circle aimed at students in grades three to five; support for undergraduate research; the continuation of a summer undergraduate workshop in geometry and topology; and the continuation of a bridge program for beginning graduate students to ease transitioning to graduate school.<br/><br/><br/>The most basic information that can be obtained from a singularity in many geometric problems is its tangent cone or tangent flow. The question of the uniqueness of such ""tangent objects"" is one of the most basic problems in geometric analysis and it is only well understood when singularities are isolated. The PI will study non-isolated singularities in two related settings: minimal hypersurfaces and the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. The tools developed for understanding the uniqueness of tangent cones and flows in these settings will also have applications to important geometric problems: the classification of minimal hypersurfaces with prescribed behavior at infinity; the generic smoothness of minimal hypersurfaces; and the possibility of surgeries at singularities along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow in connection with the Thomas-Yau conjecture. In addition to these specific applications, the PI expects that the new methods introduced in connection with the above problems will have applications in other areas of geometric analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mirror symmetry is a mysterious duality from string theory that links different fields of geometry on a manifold and its mirror image. These geometries are a priori unrelated to each other. Gravitational instantons are special four-dimensional manifolds that are the building blocks of quantum gravity theory in theoretical physics and important objects in different branches of mathematics. This project will mainly focus on gravitational instantons, starting by investigating their differential geometric aspects and then probing implications in enumerative geometry and algebraic geometry via mirror symmetry. Furthermore, the project will study how these implications feed back to differential geometry, aiming to unify the understanding of mirror symmetry from different aspects in geometry. The research will provide projects for undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will continue to organize conferences and to illustrate practical applications of mathematics for undergraduate students to increase the pool of next generation geometers.<br/> <br/>The PI plans to use the SYZ geometry to bridge the connection between gravitational instantons, mirror symmetry, and enumerative geometry. Utilizing the SYZ fibrations already constructed in various gravitational instantons recently, the PI will investigate a full SYZ mirror symmetry, simultaneously governing both A-side and B-side geometry and coupled with the Landau-Ginzburg model. The PI will use it to understand the relation between hyper-Kähler rotation with mirror symmetry. On the other hand, the knowledge from the mirror symmetry will help to study the global metric description of log Calabi-Yau surfaces and the compactification of gravitational instantons, in return to the study of the moduli space of gravitational instantons. The metric perspective of the gravitational instantons will lead to explicit calculation of local open Gromov-Witten invariants in enumerative geometry and concrete examples for comparing the family Floer mirrors and Gross-Siebert/Gross-Hacking-Keel-Siebert mirror constructions. A byproduct of the understanding of the metric description of the geometry is various new constructions of minimal Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau manifolds. Some parts of the techniques are expected to provide steppingstones for probing the Calabi-Yau three-fold geometry with fibration structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical analogues of eigenfunctions are standing waves, and the eigenvalues may be thought of as their corresponding frequencies. The interdependence between high-frequency eigenfunctions and the geometry of the manifold on which they live is central to a broad range of fields from quantum physics to number theory. Indeed, eigenfunctions are steady-state solutions to the Schrödinger equation, and their eigenvalues are the corresponding energies. To illustrate the connection to number theory, the task of accurately counting the number of eigenfunctions of a given frequency on the flat torus is equivalent to counting the number of ways an integer can be expressed as the sum of, say, two squares. This project aims to develop new tools to advance understanding in spectral asymptotics, whose interconnectedness to seemingly disparate areas of mathematics and science make its study particularly valuable. <br/><br/>As part of the research project, the PI intends to develop and use tools from microlocal analysis and the theory of Fourier integral operators to refine a variety of formulas describing the behavior of high-frequency eigenfunctions, and in particular describing what effect the underlying geometry has on these formulas. The PI intends to make advancements towards a conjecture on the remainder term of the Weyl law for products of manifolds, to develop a general multilinear theory of Fourier integral operators for use in both spectral asymptotics and geometric measure theory, and to further explore the connection between spectral quantities and the presence of corresponding geometric configurations in the manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This notion plays an important role in geometry and physics. It has also proved useful to certain applied fields such as robotics. This project seeks to extend the PI?s previous work on certain moduli spaces that arise naturally from the gauge theory of elementary particles. The research supported by this award will further our understanding of the relationship between the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties of moduli spaces. The PI will continue mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, as well as other early career researchers. He will co-organize workshops and conferences to introduce students to the latest developments in the field and to give a platform to recent Ph.D. recipients to announce the results of their research.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project lie in three areas of complex geometry related to holomorphic bundles, gauge theory, and moduli problems. The first continues work of the PI on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on Riemann surfaces. These include three subprojects: (1) conformal limits for parabolic lambda-connections; (2) an analytic construction of the universal moduli space of Higgs bundles over varying Riemann surfaces; and (3) the asymptotic structure of the moduli space and its topological properties.  In the second area of proposed research, the PI will prove further results surrounding his work on complex Chern-Simons bundles.  He will investigate the link with hyperholomorphic bundles on moduli spaces, and also clarify the relationship of his constructions to important previous work on Atiyah algebras of determinants of cohomology. The third project is the study of higher dimensional generalizations of the Yang-Mills equations and their relationship to the complex geometry of holomorphic bundles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mathematical disciplines are crucial for a host of scientific fields, including engineering, biology, and economics. For example, the mathematical modeling of any physical phenomenon that undergoes change over time can be viewed as a dynamical system. Similarly, geometry is the basis for numerous current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This research project will enhance the tools available in the aforementioned mathematical areas. The axiomatic development of geometry, which postulates a set of basic assumptions from which all other reasonable conclusions are logically deduced, dates back to ancient Greece. The major focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer postulated. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind. The project will also generate research opportunities at a variety of levels, suitable for work by graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will employ non-Archimedean tools to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics, and geometry. Essential to this endeavor is an understanding of Berkovich spaces, which are non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. One component of the project involves a detailed study of the space of metrics on an ample line bundle on a compact complex manifold. Geodesic rays within this space can be studied via non-Archimedean methods. Another topic for consideration is the Kontsevich-Soibelman conjecture, which originally arose in the study of mirror symmetry. In the areas of analysis and dynamics, non-Archimedean techniques will be employed to construct invariant currents for two-dimensional complex dynamical systems, allowing for a study of the growth of arithmetic complexity along orbits of arithmetic dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They parametrize different geometries on surfaces, so that a point in the moduli space encodes a shape which a surface can assume. Classically, one considers the evenly curved shapes, with richly different points of views arising from hyperbolic geometry, complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and matrix groups. More recently, singular flat geometries have gained prominence because of their relationship to the classical moduli space as well as their connections to important examples in the theory of dynamical systems (systems that evolve over time). This project will advance the study of moduli spaces in five interrelated research programs tied together by shared techniques and analogies. Progress on these research programs will advance the understanding of the geometry of surfaces and higher dimensional spaces and will unlock applications to dynamical systems. The nature of the topics makes their simultaneous investigation synergistic and allows for their integration into educational activities, including the training and mentoring of graduate students, vertically integrated research with undergraduate students, and the development of a new course for the bridge to PhD program. The research with undergraduates program will include a proactive recruiting strategy designed to improve participation of members of groups historically underrepresented in mathematics. Undergraduate participants will be encouraged to participate in the MathCorp summer outreach program, and the more senior participants will receive training on mentoring.<br/><br/>The five research programs that will be undertaken are as follows. First, the PI will build quasi-convex co-bounded planes in Teichmüller spaces, and eventually convex cocompact surface subgroups of mapping class groups, by gluing together components obtained via dynamics. Second, the PI will determine if there is a non-trivial orbit closure of translation surfaces of rank at least 3, by classifying special constructions and investigating low genus moduli spaces. Third, the PI will show typical high genus surfaces are good spectral expanders, using the trace formula and work of Mirzakhani.

The twofold purpose of the proposed activities are to gather leading experts and early-career researchers working in rapidly developing subjects, and to foster interaction between groups of mathematicians and physicists working on different aspects of related problems; this will facilitate cross-fertilization between different fields and disseminate the most recent results of current research. GAP XVII and GAP XVIII will allow earlier-career mathematicians to disseminate their ideas and to broaden their perspective, both mathematically and internationally. Both summer schools, which will provide the opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas with foreign peers and launch collaborations, will include a poster session for individuals to present their recent work. <br/><br/>The theme of both schools is ""Higher Structures: Deformations and Homotopy Algebras"". GAP XVII (2022) will be devoted to ""Deformations"" and GAP XVIII (2023) to ""Homotopy Algebras"". Higher structures has emerged as a new field in mathematics, as well as in mathematical and theoretical physics. Covering many different topics, this field encompasses deformation theory, quantization, homotopy algebras, derived geometry, enumerative geometry, representation theory, Poisson geometry, mirror symmetry, noncommutative algebraic geometry, string theory, and quantum field theory. The event will be devoted to bringing together different aspects of higher structures, in particular deformations and homotopy algebras, as well as identifying new emerging directions of investigation. Deformation theory has become an important area of mathematics. Deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking, it is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. Homotopy algebras provide a powerful machinery for studying many interconnected questions in different areas of contemporary mathematics and mathematical physics.

Variational questions arise in several areas of pure and applied mathematics and in many physical sciences. For example, minimal surfaces arise as critical points of the area functional and provide a mathematical model of soap films. Another example is an entropy functional for submanifolds that serves as a natural measure of the complexity of a surface. The main tool used to study this functional is the mean curvature flow, which is a dynamic process that, roughly speaking, continuously deforms a surface in a manner that decreases its area as quickly as possible. Mean curvature flow was first studied as a model of certain phenomena in materials science and has also found applications in computer graphics and image recognition. This project aims to advance understanding in this area through study of minimal surfaces, especially those that are singular, and their connections to the submanifold entropy functional. The project includes opportunities for research training of graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will study properties of singular minimal surfaces and singular mean curvature flows.

The Theorema Egregium established a relationship between the way a surface curves inside of space and how its intrinsic geometry differs from that of the classical geometry of the plane, studied by Euclid. An immediate consequence of the Theorema Egregium is that it is impossible to make a map of the world without distorting some crucial aspects of its geometry. More startling was the generalization of Gausss ideas to higher-dimensional spaces by his student Riemann in the mid 19th century, which gave birth to the subject that is now known as Riemannian Geometry. While Riemannian Geometry and its generalizations have found wide-ranging applications, for example, in relativity, particle physics, and data science, answers to many basic, fundamental questions in the subject are enduring mysteries. This project is a two-pronged attack on some of these questions via what are known as Comparison Geometry and Inverse Comparison Geometry. Comparison Geometry is the branch of Global Riemannian Geometry that draws geometric and topological conclusions about a space with some constraint on its curvature by comparing it to a model space with constant curvature. Inverse Comparison Geometry concerns the opposite question; that is, which spaces admit Riemannian geometries that satisfy a given geometric constraint. The project will employ methods from both subjects to continue attacking problems that lie at the heart of Global Riemannian Geometry. The project also includes advising and mentoring of students, continued commitment to DEI initiatives and mathematical dissemination.<br/><br/>This research centers on three basic problems: the Diffeomorphism Stability Question, the Pinching Problem in positive curvature, and the constructions of manifolds with almost nonnegative curvature. The Diffeomorphism Stability Question asks whether a Gromov-Hausdorff convergent sequence of Riemannian manifolds has a stable diffeomorphism type provided the sequence is noncollapsing and has a uniform lower sectional curvature bound. Perelman's stability theorem guarantees that such a sequence has a stable topological type, and a result of Kuwae, Machigashira, and Shioya guarantees a stable diffeomorphism type provided the limit is nonsingular, in the appropriate sense. A generic limit has singularities. Nevertheless, the PI and his collaborators Grove, Sill, and Pro, have established that certain singular limit spaces are di¤eomorphically stable. This includes a recent result by Pro and the PI showing that Diffeomorphism Stability holds in dimension 4, regardless of the singular structure of the limit space. Together with prior work by Grove-Petersen-Wu, Perelman, and Kirby-Siebenmann, this means that the conclusion of Cheeger's Finiteness Theorem holds without the hypothesis of the upper curvature bound. The project aims to establish (jointly with Chambers and Pro) that Piecewise Linear Stability holds in all dimensions. The project with Searle and Solórzano will develop tools to show that some limit spaces are not diffeomorphically stable. Searle, Solórzano, and the PI will also use these tools to show that there are almost nonnegatively curved exotic spheres in all dimensions 7 and higher that are congruent to 3 mod 4. The Pinching Problem in positive curvature asks how the topology of a positively curved manifold is constrained as its curvature is pinched. The gap between theorems and examples in this area is startling. The project in collaboration with Guijarro and Murphy will improve the Abresch-Meyer injectivity radius estimate by exploiting the Jacobi Field Comparison Lemma of Guijarro and the PI. The project also includes significant training and mentoring of students, mathematical dissemination and commitment to service and DEI initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even after decades of investigations, many basic questions about such systems remain open. For example, it is not known which of these systems have a rigidly algebraic description (can be constructed from groups). The project aims at studying the connections of hyperbolic dynamical systems with group theory, the theory of automata, and other branches of algebra. Conversely, the project plans to use the insights gained from the study of hyperbolic systems to solve open questions in group theory.  The project also includes training and advising of students, organization of an annual high school mathematics competition, and the completion of a graduate textbook on groups and topological dynamics.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic dynamical systems are classical and well-studied examples of chaotic dynamics.

The question is probably very hard, but the project outlines several directions toward clarifying group-theoretic aspects. The project aims to study automatic structures associated with hyperbolic systems and groups generated by such automatic structures. These groups may have interesting applications to the theory of the growth of groups and amenability. The project's plans also include the study of the relation between group theory (contraction coefficients of virtual endomorphisms) and the conformal dimension of hyperbolic dynamical systems, which can have interesting applications of group theory to rigidity results in dynamics and to asymptotic group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deep connections between the integers and a broad range of mathematical areas from geometry to number theory have direct analogues for lattices in Lie groups, and the way in which lattices in Lie groups sit at the interface of so many fields has made them of fundamental importance since the late 19th century. The primary motivation for this project is to deepen our understanding of these connections, in particular for hyperbolic manifolds and their close relatives. Hyperbolic geometry is the ""negatively curved"" counterpart to classical Euclidean geometry (zero curvature) and spherical geometry (positive curvature), and hyperbolic manifolds are poorly understood compared with their Euclidean and spherical counterparts. Relating hyperbolic manifolds to discrete subgroups of Lie groups provides access to a wide spectrum of mathematical tools, including algebra and dynamics, that have borne significant recent fruit, including recent work of the PI with U.

More importantly, the questions studied in dimensions 2 and 3 for the last forty years are closely related to classical problems about discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and real and complex hyperbolic lattices are precisely the cases where many of the basic questions remain open, e.g., (non)triviality of Betti numbers and problems related to (non)arithmeticity. Particular problems to be studied include analogues of the Margulis superrigidity theorem in rank one, building on the PI's recent breakthroughs with Bader-Fisher-Miller, and understanding complex hyperbolic lattices using techniques from algebraic geometry and continuing/generalizing the PI's work with D.

Wave and Schrödinger equations are important partial differential equations that describe how waves, including sound, light, and gravitational waves, propagate in the natural world.  Much is known about the behavior of solutions to these equations when the underlying media are smooth. However, most practical applications involve waves propagating in media that contain obstructions or discontinuities. The aim of this project is to resolve open questions about how waves scatter and decay when the underlying medium is not smooth. The results of the project are expected to inform predictions in several applications involving wave behavior in non-smooth media, including the propagation of seismic waves, the behavior of plasma, and light propagation in optical fibers. The project will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students in a central, active area of mathematical physics.<br/><br/>This project concerns research in geometric scattering theory. The project has two objectives. The first is to prove upper bounds on the resolvent of the semiclassical Schrödinger operator in limited regularity. Such resolvent bounds are a precursor to local energy decay rates for rough wave equations. The second objective is to use the recently developed Fredholm method to establish the existence of scattering-type eigenfunctions for a wide class of nonlinear Helmholtz equations. The main tools for this project come from semiclassical and microlocal analysis. In particular, the principal investigator aims to extend positive commutator and Carleman estimates, separation of variables, and b-vector field analysis to Schrödinger operators with low regularity coefficients.

However, for several natural phenomena, the area functional is only a first approximation. In order to capture microstructures, most models in the sciences use directionally dependent functionals, referred to as anisotropic energies. Ever since the introduction of anisotropic energies by Gibbs in the 19th century to model crystals, they have been extensively applied in material sciences and engineering, motivating seminal works in geometric analysis. However, since anisotropic energies are not invariant under translations and rotations, they don?t enjoy the conservation laws of the area functional, which makes them significantly more complicated to study. The PI will advance the anisotropic minimal surfaces theory. Understanding existence, regularity, uniqueness and stability of solutions to anisotropic geometric variational problems plays a major role in analysis, geometry, topology and physics. The PI will also conduct vertically integrated educational activities tied with the research activities. In particular, undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed to the problems and techniques of this project via the organization of seminars, conferences, and a summer school.<br/><br/>The PI will study existence, regularity, uniqueness and stability properties of anisotropic minimal surfaces. The existence of anisotropic minimal surfaces in Riemannian manifolds will require extending the min-max theory. In order to determine the regularity of anisotropic minimal surfaces, the PI will study the related geometric nonlinear elliptic PDEs. In addition to the stationary configurations, this research will shed light on the anisotropic Brakke flow and its approximation, through the analysis of the related parabolic PDEs. This project will also address the uniqueness of critical points of the anisotropic isoperimetric problem and investigate the stability properties of the Wulff shapes.

In addition to having a rich history, minimal surfaces are an important tool in analysis of physical systems and geometric questions. A prominent example is the role stable minimal surfaces play in the study of scalar curvature in general relativity.  Just like the soap films they model, minimal surfaces in general have a ""singular set"" where they are not smooth (for example, consider bubbles in the bathtub: they have singular junctions were multiple bubbles meet).  The goal of this project is to work towards better understanding of the singular set of a minimal surface, what structure it possesses, and the behavior of the minimal surface near singularities.  In addition to pursuing these research projects, the PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate students and continue outreach work with a local community center's afterschool math program for elementary-, middle-, and high-school students.<br/><br/>This project studies higher dimensional minimal hypersurfaces that are area-minimizing, stable, or have finite index.  If one precludes, often for natural reasons of orientability, ""Y-type"" singularities (encountered in the bathtub), then the singular set drops to codimension 7.  The project will study the space of 7-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces with isolated singularities and finite index/area in a closed 8-manifold, with the view towards a proving a notion of ""bumpiness"" for certain singular minimal hypersurfaces.  The PI will also investigate non-isolated singularities.  The research will also attempt to classify 8-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces in Euclidean space asymptotic to certain cylindrical cones, which would serve to model the geometric degeneration of surfaces towards these cylindrical singularities.

Algebraic geometry studies mathematical objects called varieties that are solutions of equations built from addition and multiplication. Symplectic geometry is the natural geometry that emerges when one studies Hamilton's equations, which are equations describing the motion of classical physical systems. A very important collection of tools, called Floer theory, has been utilized to solve many problems in both of the subject areas above. However, these tools are hard to use since the computations involved can be quite difficult. A part of this project involves finding better computational techniques via an object called the arc space. Another part of this project is concerned with finding more refined ways of counting curves inside varieties as well as establishing efficient foundations for such counts using ideas from symplectic geometry.

Another project is to compute the full contact homology of any isolated singularity in terms of its arc space.

Since then, it has been a deep mystery appearing in many frontiers of mathematics. In general, it appears to be a hidden relation between symplectic geometry, which is the natural framework for describing classical mechanics, and complex algebraic geometry. More recent discoveries link it with several other areas of mathematics and physics. Still, as of today, there is no systematic understanding of mirror symmetry. The main goal of this focused research group is to establish a universal tool to study mirror symmetry and related geometric questions arising in modern frontiers of geometry and topology. In particular, the project aims at constructing a large class of concrete models that would demonstrate all aspects of mirror symmetry. The investigators bring expertise from different areas of mathematics and will use a variety of techniques. They will also organize workshops, summer schools, and conferences, aimed at training early career researchers in this area, disseminating recent results and facilitating further advances.<br/><br/>In the original context, mirror symmetry relates counting problems in one space with complex differential equations on its mirror symmetric space. As understanding has evolved, mirror symmetry has been identified as the Laplace transform in certain cases, which provides an effective mechanism of computing quantum invariants of a space from the complex geometry of its mirror. In general, it is a higher categorical relation between symplectic geometry and complex algebraic geometry. In a gauge theoretic context, mirror symmetry appears in the form of the Langlands duality among algebraic groups. More recent discoveries link it with quantum knot invariants. The main goal of the project is to establish complex Lagrangian geometry as a universal tool to study geometric questions and quantization arising in modern frontiers of geometry and topology and to construct models in which we can see all aspects of mirror symmetry, including the real symplectic-complex algebraic duality, the Langlands duality, the Laplace transform, and a relation to three-manifold invariants. In Lagrange's formulation many non-linear problems can be solved via integrable systems, an approach which is widely applicable, extending far beyond its classical origins to high-energy particle physics and string theory. This project aims to advance understanding of the complex integrable systems that arise in such situations, together with their quantum mechanical counterparts, by considering concrete models constructed on Hitchin integrable systems. The work will employ a generalization of the Laplace transform known as topological recursion that is expected to provide a conjectural new mechanism for holomorphic quantization of these spaces and shed new light on mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last hundred years have seen significant advances and generalizations in two directions: on one hand, we now how how to study related problems on other spaces including on the sphere, in hyperbolic space, and in Gaussian space. On the other hand, in some situations we can describe what happens when we optimize multiple sets at the same time. In particular, we can describe what happens to soap bubbles when they touch, which also gives insight into the structure of foams. Surprisingly, these geometric problems have a close link to computational complexity: is it widely believed that many important computational problems cannot be solved efficiently. More importantly for applications (because in practice we don't often need exact solutions), it's computationally hard even to approximately solve some of these problems. The field that studies this topic, known as ""hardness of approximation,"" has progressed in leaps and bounds over the last two decades, and one of its seminal achievements was the forging of a deep connection between computational complexity and isoperimetric-type problems in geometry and probability. If we had a better understanding of certain probabilistic, high-dimensional, multi-part isoperimetric problems, it would close several open problems in hardness of approximation.  The project will also develop software for numerical computation and support the advising and mentoring of students.<br/><br/>This project is about introducing and exploiting new techniques for multi-part isoperimetric problems, with an emphasis on both problems that are natural in geometry (such as the double-bubble conjecture on the sphere) and problems coming from computer science. One of the difficulties with these partitioning problems is the presence of combinatorially many saddle points or local minima, but the investigator's recent resolution (with E. Milman) of the Gaussian double-bubble conjecture included a new method to circumvent this difficulty; the PI will build on this success by extending the method to related settings.

These flows are defined on manifolds equipped with a metric, that is to say, a way of measuring distance. A Ricci flow is a geometric partial differential equation for Riemannian metrics. The Ricci flow tends to evolve an initial metric into a more homogeneous one. The singularity analysis of Ricci flow is a central subject, as it helps to understand the geometry and topology of manifolds. The most remarkable application in this direction is the resolution of the Poincare conjecture and the Geometrization conjecture by Perelman. Many of the Ricci flow singularity models are Ricci solitons. Recent examples of solitons constructed by the PI look like flying wings. The PI will study the geometry of all 3-dimensional steady Ricci solitons and try to classify them by their asymptotic limits. In addition, the PI will study the higher-dimensional steady Ricci solitons and see if they can arise as singularity models.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The research project is split into two projects. The first project is to prove the O(2)-symmetry of all 3-dimensional steady Ricci solitons. This includes showing that the Bryant soliton is the unique 3-dimensional steady Ricci soliton that is asymptotic to a ray. This extends a previous result of the PI in which one assumes the O(2)-symmetry of the soliton. The PI developed some methods that may be extended to the more general class of ancient collapsed Ricci flows in dimension 3. In particular, the PI will investigate the symmetry of the ancient collapsed Ricci flows in dimension 3 and aim at classifying them by certain 2-dimensional limits. The second project is a continuation of the PI's work on the existence theory of Ricci flows coming out of non-compact initial manifolds. The PI will investigate the applications of non-compact Ricci flows in topology and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a central field in mathematics, which has ramifications and connections in physics and other sciences. One of the main themes of this research is the study of a class of spaces, known as Calabi-Yau, which play an important role in mathematics as well as high energy theoretical physics. According to string theory, our four-dimensional physical space-time possesses six extra dimensions which are extremely small, so that we don't normally perceive them, but are crucial for understanding elementary particles. These six dimensions together form a tiny Calabi-Yau space, which captures essential features of particle physics. Understanding its geometry would allow us to understand how particles are created and how they interact, and is one of the main current problems in mathematical physics. <br/><br/><br/>The PI will use techniques from geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations to investigate problems about the geometry of complex and symplectic manifolds. The first project is about understanding limits of Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds as the Kahler class degenerates. This is closely related to the theory of mirror symmetry, which was inspired by physical considerations. The second project concerns the long-time behavior of the Ricci flow on compact Kahler manifolds, in the most difficult case when collapsing occurs at infinite time. The Ricci flow was used spectacularly to prove the Poincare and Geometrization conjectures for 3-manifolds, and understanding its behavior on higher-dimensional manifolds is a central problem in the field. The third project is centered on Donaldson's program to extend Yau's solution of the Calabi Conjecture in Kahler geometry to symplectic four-manifolds. This would provide a new analytic tool to construct symplectic forms four-manifolds as solutions of a highly nonlinear PDE, and would have striking applications in symplectic topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the conference is to expose the inter-connectivity of these topics to a wide range of researchers whose work may not necessarily touch each of the areas, including researchers from underrepresented groups, early career researchers, and researchers from liberal arts and R2 universities.  The format for the conference includes one hour plenary research talks, multiple lightning-talk sessions, and dedicated time for informal mathematical discussions.  This event will provide the impetus for new collaborations between researchers from diverse mathematical fields and institutions, and from a wide variety of career stages.<br/><br/>The conference will focus on the interactions between geometric topology, geometric group theory, number theory, representation theory, and spectral geometry. At the heart of this interplay is the theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups, where one can produce manifolds via the actions of discrete groups on associated homogeneous spaces. Of particular interest are discrete groups acting isometrically on hyperbolic space. These actions play a fundamental role in low dimensional geometry and topology via geometrization, and have provided the impetus for much current research in geometric group theory and the deformation theory of geometric structures. Among the discrete subgroups of simple Lie groups more generally, arithmetic lattices play a central role, utilizing technology from algebraic/analytic number theory and the theory of algebraic groups. These interactions provide deep and important connections between the geometry of the associated spaces and the algebra of the arithmetic lattices. All these interactions have driven mathematical research for more than one hundred years, and this conference will bring together researchers from these areas and closely related fields to search for new and exciting connections for the future.

This is especially true of symplectic geometry -- the geometry of phase spaces of classical mechanics, where points are ""too small"" to be relevant, and it is more natural to consider objects called Lagrangian submanifolds. These objects and their interactions are encoded by an algebraic structure (or ""non-commutative space"") called the Fukaya category. A remarkable mathematical conjecture inspired by ideas from theoretical physics, ""homological mirror symmetry"", asserts that Fukaya categories are in fact often equivalent to honest (commutative) spaces of the sort studied in algebraic geometry. This research project studies versions of Fukaya categories for symplectic manifolds equipped with one or more (commuting) functions and/or relative to certain directions at infinity. The rich structure of these categories, coming from the additional data, yields new ways of understanding the effect of various geometric constructions on the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold; this in turn should greatly extend the range of settings in which homological mirror symmetry can be verified. The project will also provide research opportunities for several graduate students and generally aim to make this research area more accessible to the broader mathematical community.<br/><br/> From a technical standpoint, the first goal of this project is to develop a better geometric setup for partially wrapped Fukaya categories as they arise in mirror symmetry, to arrive at a formulation where computations are possible and the expected structural features are manifest. The other main goal is to use these foundations to give a general proof of homological mirror symmetry for (not necessarily Calabi-Yau) complete intersections in toric varieties, and to study canonical bases of their coordinate rings. Finally, this project will also bring conceptual clarity to the field by unifying different proposed constructions of partially wrapped Fukaya categories, finding new instances of functoriality in mirror symmetry, and studying the interplay between geometric constructions and categorical ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Being locally area minimizing, they are quite special and have applications in various domains, e.g., chemistry, materials science, biology, low dimensional topology and mathematical physics. In general relativity, minimal surfaces appear as models for the apparent horizons of black holes. In biology and material science, minimal surfaces are used in the design of materials with key applications. Recently, the PI used well-known notions about minimal surfaces to explain some fundamental questions in topological data analysis which have powerful applications in several fields in data science. In addition to this research, the PI aims to focus on teaching and training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as advancing the field by organizing seminars, conferences and writing expository materials.<br/><br/> <br/>In particular, the project will study the existence and significant properties of minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are one of the most important families of manifolds in the low dimensional topology. Unfortunately, as the topological understanding of these manifolds is quite challenging, the study of minimal surfaces in this setting have not been considered by those in geometric analysis for many years. Even though there are several breakthrough results in geometric analysis in the past decade, minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds are still an uncharted territory, and many fundamental questions are still open. In this project, the PI aims to completely resolve the existence question of minimal surfaces in infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and study one of Thurston?s famous conjectures about the minimal foliations in closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying these questions may stimulate useful developments in pure mathematics and lead to wider applications in science and technology. For instance, the isoperimetric inequality has numerous applications due to its connections with a host of other important inequalities, including the Sobolev inequality in mathematical analysis and the Faber-Krahn inequality in spectral analysis. Furthermore, the rigidity of surfaces may have applications for stability of complicated domes in modern architecture, while the medial axis, or cut locus of distance functions, is an important tool in shape recognition, which is of interest in computer graphics and mathematical biology. These questions are ideal for introducing the public to the exciting world of modern mathematics and arousing the interest of beginning students in geometry.

Some recurring themes throughout these investigations, which the PI conducts in joint work with his students and collaborators, are various notions of convexity or optimization and the interaction between geometric and topological concepts, or local versus global properties of submanifolds.

Each workshop extends over three days, and the conference will consist of three periods, each period featuring 7 mathematically diverse but interconnected workshops, with 21 workshops in total. These activities combined with poster sessions and informal interactions among participants all synthesize forefront research with mentoring and training opportunities for young participants, helping them develop networks that include the world?s leading researchers. A number of themes connect the diverse workshop topics, such as learning from computation to automate, adapt and optimize the computational process which by itself becomes an analysis tool, ties from homotopy methods used in computational algebraic geometry for systems of algebraic equations and interior point methods in continuous optimization to numerical methods for differential equations and aspects of differential geometry, machine learning and signal processing cast as very large and challenging convex optimization problems, common themes among symbolic algorithms used for the solution of algebraic and differential equations, and relationships between decidability and tractability in real/complex arithmetic computational models and the Turing machine models considered in the context of combinatorics and intractability as well as discrete optimization.

The 2022 event includes an Advanced School at the Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona, Spain, July 18-22, 2022 and a Conference at the headquarters of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Madrid,  Spain, July 25-29, 2022. Poisson geometry is an area originally inspired by physics, which has found a huge number of applications both in mathematics and other areas of science. This activity will bring together a diverse group of mathematicians to explore the modern interplay between Poisson geometry and its many applications in different fields. The school will consist of four mini-courses given by leading junior and senior mathematicians. It will introduce the participants, mostly early-career mathematicians, to a broad spectrum of ideas on the forefront of modern research in Poisson geometry. The conference program will feature 21 talks given by leading experts, covering the most active topics in Poisson geometry and its applications. The goal of these activities is to make recent developments in the field accessible to all participants, to broaden their perspective on major areas of current research, and to create a stimulating environment in which they can share ideas and begin lasting interdisciplinary collaborations. The purpose of the award is to support the participation of US-based researchers in this event.<br/><br/>This meeting aims to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists, and groups working on related areas from different points of view. The Conference is the forum where the most significant recent advances in the area are announced and discussed, and the potential future directions of the subject are addressed. Topics cover a wide range of areas arising from Poisson brackets and its applications, including symplectic, Dirac, generalized complex and related structures, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, Poisson algebras and Poisson varieties, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization and higher structures, non-commutative geometry, quantum groups and representation theory. The School has a strong training component, including two introductory courses in Poisson Geometry and Foliation Theory, and two more advanced level courses in Geometric Quantization and Wonderful Compactifications.  During the opening of the conference, the winner(s) of the Andre Lichnerowicz Prize in Poisson geometry will be announced. The prize is awarded for notable contributions to Poisson geometry and its applications, to researchers who completed their doctorates at most eight years before the year of the Conference.
