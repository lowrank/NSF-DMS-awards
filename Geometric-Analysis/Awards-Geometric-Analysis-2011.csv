There are two complementary conjectures that purport to explain this duality-Kontsevich's Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture (HMS) and the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture (SYZ). The principal investigator aims to study mirror symmetry in the context of these conjectures by studying explicit examples. First, an investigation of the manifold mirror to the quintic threefold will be undertaken. The PI will search for objects on the mirror manifold that exhibit behavior similar to a certain class of Lagrangian submanifolds on the quintic. This will provide a direct and concrete illustration of HMS. In conjunction with this work, a study of Floer cohomology of Lagrangians in K3 surfaces will be undertaken. This work will exploit explicit Lagrangian torus fibration constructions of Gross, Castano-Bernard, Matessi and others, which in turn are inspired by the SYZ conjecture.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry are deep and important fields  whose origins go back hundreds of years. The questions and ideas arising  from these fields have inspired many mathematicians and physicists and led  to great scientific advances. Mirror symmetry promises to add to this  legacy. Mirror symmetry has its roots in string theory and today is an  important branch of physics. To mathematicians, mirror symmetry is an  exciting and tantalizing subject because it hints at a link between  algebraic and symplectic geometry. It is often these types of links-links  between different subjects-that lead to breakthroughs. The goal of this  project is to discover links between algebraic and sympletic geometry by  applying newly developed theory and techniques to certain examples that  are of central importance to mirror symmetry."

Mirror symmetry is an exciting and rapidly developing field that is concerned with duality between the complex and symplectic geometry of certain Calabi-Yau manifolds. The search for the underlying principles at work in mirror symmetry has driven a great deal of the research in symplectic and complex/algebraic geometry over the past two decades. Many of the ideas and techniques used to study mirror symmetry have become interesting areas of research in their own right. Examples include Gromov-Witten theory, Floer theory, Fukaya categories, derived categories, Lagrangian torus fibrations, special Lagrangian geometry, Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and tropical geometry. The breadth of ideas involved and number of approaches to the subject make it fertile ground for collaboration. The conference will exploit this by bringing together researchers studying a wide variety of the geometric and algebraic aspects of mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The goal of the conference is to advance mirror symmetry by opening and strengthening lines of communications between researchers, finding areas for collaboration, and educating participants. The conference will have several important features in order to achieve these goals. To further the educational aims, the conference will feature a mini-course designed to educate participants on a particular topic at a high but non-expert level. The mini-course will be useful to graduate students as well as to more senior participants, both as an educational experience and as an opportunity to find areas for collaboration. There will be a poster session that will allow graduate students to show off their work. This will provide an opportunity for young researchers to communicate with more senior researchers and will provide an excellent opportunity for the transfer of knowledge. The conference will feature participants who are experts in both geometric and algebraic aspects of mirror symmetry and thus will provide an opportunity to find ways to integrate diverse ideas. Finally, mirror symmetry has its roots in string theory and high energy physics and today is an important branch of theoretical physics. The conference will increase communication between mathematicians and physicists by inviting both types of people to attend.<br/>More information can be found on the conference website:<br/>http://www.math.ksu.edu/~galston/conference/"

Pflaum<br/><br/>The proposed work will advance the study of singularities by means of noncommutative geometry. Spaces with singularities appear abundantly and naturally in various areas of mathematics. Standard methods developed to study smooth manifolds or smooth varieties can in general not be extended to the singular setting, so one has to develop new approaches.  Among the most promising new and original proposals which will provide progress for singularity theory is the idea to determine the cyclic homology theory of function algebras over spaces with singularities.  This is the viewpoint from noncommutative geometry which goes back to the work of A. Connes and which has turned out to provide deeper mathematical insight not only into the structure theory of noncommutative but also of commutative algebras. In addition to the computation of cyclic homologies of function algebras over singular spaces, the PI plans to combine recent results from the stratification theory of singular spaces with noncommutative geometry to open up new paths to examine singularities. The construction of new topological invariants of singularities by this approach also promises to provide progress for index theory over spaces with singularities.  In particular, it is intended to define inertia spaces associated to proper Lie groupoids and study their singularity structure with the goal of constructing a mathematical device which keeps track of the contribution of singularities to the cyclic homology of convolution algebras over proper Lie groupoids.  Finally, relative cyclic cohomology theory will be used to construct and describe secondary invariants of geometric operators in singular situations.<br/><br/>Singularity theory is the mathematical discipline in which one describes and studies geometrical objects containing so-called singularities such as corners, edges or vertices. Besides these rather elementary singularities, considerably more complicated ones appear not only in mathematics itself but also in many physical or technical applications like for example hydro dynamics, string theory, robotics or catastrophe theory, which plays a fundamental role in the theoretical understanding of ""catastrophic"" phenomena in laser physics or population dynamics.  A better mathematical understanding of singularities therefore will not only lead to progress within mathematics but also will have its impact for theoretical physics or engineering in situations where singular phenomena appear.  The proposed project aims at improving the foundational knowledge on singularities by connecting singularity theory to another modern mathematical theory, namely noncommutative geometry. It is to be expected that this way new mathematical invariants for singularities can be constructed. This will provide further crucial steps towards a classification of singularities as they appear in mathematics, the sciences or engineering.  To strengthen the broader impact of the project, the PI plans to present visualizations of singularities via a website specifically designed to disseminate mathematical knowledge.<br/>"

The criterion is that geodesics in this group, which represent Lagrangian motions of fluids, fail to minimize length on ever-shorter intervals as the blowup time is reached. This condition can be understood in terms of positive blowup of the sectional curvature, as well as in terms of the weak geometry of the space of volume-preserving maps. We propose to investigate the geometry using three simpler approximate geometries in order to try to rule out blowup geometrically.<br/><br/>This project involves studying the Euler equations, which describe the motion of a fluid in three dimensions. The problem of showing that these equations can be used to describe the fluid forever, even if the motion becomes very turbulent, has been studied for hundreds of years but remains unsolved. We propose a new approach which involves viewing the fluid geometrically, as a shortest path in an infinite-dimensional curved space (in much the same way that an airplane traces out a length-minimizing path on the two-dimensional curved surface of the earth). Although this geometric picture of a fluid has been known since the 1960s, only recently has it been possible to relate turbulent motion to path length in this curved space, and the project is to use this approach to help decide whether the equations are always valid or whether they have to ""blow up"" when the fluid motion gets too complicated."

Namely to study  the classifications of self-similar solutions,  e.g gradient solitons and ancient solutions, as well as the convexity type estimates in general. Such results have far-reaching consequences in the singularity analysis, and applications of Ricci flow in the study of geometric-topological structure of the manifolds. The second theme of the project is on  the sharp gradient estimates of Li-Yau-Hamilton type, related monotonicity formulae and applications in geometric nonlinear PDEs. Their relations to physics, statistical mechanics will be studied too. The aim is to discover a fundamental physical/geometric principle to unify various sharp estimates and monotonicity formulae. It will also provide the guideline for further discovery of the new monotonicity formulae in other geometric PDEs.<br/><br/>Since all physical event takes place in a space, the subject of differential geometry which studies the geometric properties of the space has important consequence in every physical event. This project mainly involves the study of partial differential equations of parabolic type which arise from differential geometry, and their applications to the understanding of  various geometric/topological properties of manifolds. This area lies in the center of the current mathematics. It naturally connects various area of mathematics, such as topology, Riemannian geometry, partial differential geometry, Lie groups, as well as mathematical physics. The techniques developed can be useful in understanding problems in economics, material sciences and bio-sciences."

Topics of the summer school and the conference are centered around quantizations,  covering several different fields of mathematics, including mathematical physics, geometric quantization, deformation quantization, and quantum analogues of classical objects. These topics are closely related to recent developments in functional analysis, representation theory of Lie groups, and spectral geometry. The summer school is geared toward undergraduate students and graduate students followed by a conference.  The summer school consists of two weeks of program with the first week aimed at undergraduate students and the second week geared to graduate students. The summer school and the conference will promote research activities in areas of mathematics related to quantization. The organizers have selected lecturers with a broad array of interests and backgrounds, including some physicists. The summer school and conference will give graduate students access to a wide array of current research activity in quantization, and give the students an opportunity to interact with prominent researchers. A public lecture by a physicist engaged in the Large Hadron Collider project in Europe will help enhance public awareness of science, and also give mathematicians the opportunity to interact with an experimental high energy physicist. The undergraduate summer school will expose top undergraduates to important ideas in mathematical physics, and encourage them to learn more about physics. The volume of proceedings of the conference will serve as a resource for students and researchers interested in learning about quantization. <br/><br/>Quantization is an important topic in mathematics and physics. From the physics point of view, methods of quantization are procedures for building models for quantum mechanical systems from analogous and more intuitive classical mechanical systems, which provide strikingly precise experimental predictions. Much of the development of theoretical physics in the 20th century may be regarded as the process of refining quantization to give improved experimental predictions, and the search for a unified field theory is an attempt to quantize general relativity in a manner compatible with existing quantum theory. On the mathematics side, problems related to quantization and quantum mechanics provided a strong motivation for the development of functional analysis, the representation theory of Lie groups, and spectral geometry. More recent developments with much current activity include geometric quantization, deformation quantization, and quantum analogues of various classical objects. The Program on Quantization will inaugurate a new Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame. It will combine two week-long summer schools, one aimed at advanced undergraduates and one aimed at graduate students with a conference devoted to the most recent advances in the area. The invited speakers at the conference are among the world's leading experts in the mathematics of quantization."

Two of the finest examples of such theorems are the Sphere theorem of Rauch, Klingenberg and Berger (which restricts the global topology under geometric constraints) and the Mostow Rigidity theorem (which restricts the geometry under topological constraints). To this end the PI proposes to study more general spaces and investigate rigidity phenomena for them. In previous work with R. Spatzier and B. Wilking we showed that a manifold with sectional curvature less than or equal to 1 and a conjugate point along every geodesic at t equal to pi; is (locally) isometric to a compact, rank one symmetric space. This led to a natural question about other possible rigidity phenomena along these lines: Is there rigidity if we have the same condition on conjugate points but assume sectional curvature greater than or equal to 1? There has been significant progress on this question in collaboration with Ben Schmidt and Ralf Spatzier. In joint work with C. Sormani we extended the notion of conjugate points and proved classical theorems for complete length spaces. This leads to the question of extending rigidity theorems to spaces with two sided curvature bounds in the sense of Toponogov. We have some preliminary results in this more general setting. Several other projects are proposed including  the study of Riemannian submersions from compact Lie groups (continuing recent work in this area) and studying the geometry of low cohomogeneity actions on round spheres.<br/><br/>Most of us have an intuitive understanding of the term, ""curvature"". Tabletops and desktops are flat while basketballs and saddles are curved. The surface of our planet is curved as well, and we know the controversy that generated in Columbus' time! The mathematical study of the curvature of objects is the purview of differential geometry. Geometers are able to quantify curvature precisely and it provides a numerical invariant that helps distinguish objects. One may distinguish objects by shape or nature. For instance, the surface of a doughnut and the surface of a coffee cup have the same nature i.e., they are both surfaces with one hole, but they are shaped differently. On the other hand, the surface of a ball (usually called a sphere) is different in shape and nature from the surface of a doughnut (usually called a torus). How can we be sure that this is always the case? One may wonder if it is possible to deform the sphere suitably so that we might end up with the torus. This is the kind of problem that differential geometry can tackle with relative ease. A sphere has positive curvature everywhere while it can be shown that no matter what shape a torus takes, it will always have zero curvature somewhere. This tells us that the two objects are somehow fundamentally different from each other. Results of this kind are of interest to geometers as well as physicists. Differential geometry is the language used to express the general theory of relativity, our best theoretical description of gravity and its effects on the universe. In general relativity, a vacuous space-time universe would be inherently flat. This idealized state is warped by the presence of masses or energy, due to their gravitational effects. Thus, gravity is the curvature in space-time, and this is used to explain phenomena such as black holes and gravitational lensing. My are of research is the study of objects in higher dimensions (just as spacetime is four dimensional) that have positive curvature and exhibit rigidity properties under suitable additional geometric restrictions. In higher dimensions, matters are far less visually apparent. One deals almost exclusively with equations and sophisticated geometrical techniques that describe the curvature of manifolds, a term that refers to objects that, roughly speaking, have no sharp edges. Manifolds of bounded size are called compact manifolds. One of the great mysteries in the study of positive curvature is the dearth of examples of (compact) manifolds that have positive curvature at every point. The techniques at hand are few and the number of known examples remains relatively small. Therefore, any light that one can shed on the structure of such manifolds would be valuable. Structure theorems such as these are what might lead us some day to determine the precise shape of the universe."

Another important example is a generalization of Kahler Ricci flow to non-Kahler complex manifolds introduced in prior work of the PI and G. Tian.  By utilizing methods from the well-developed theory of Ricci flow as well as techniques from complex geometry, the PI proposes to refine his existing work to understand the singularity formation of these flows.  Aside from the intrinsic value of understanding physically natural equations, one possible direct application is to understand the topology of complex surfaces.<br/><br/>The method of geometric flows is a relatively new technique for understanding the structure of geometric objects.  Ultimately, by understanding these equations one can gain a deep understanding of topological structures.  Furthermore, these equations typically have a physical motivation, and hence by understanding them we gain insight into natural physical processes.  Even beyond these theoretical uses geometric flows have recently seen industrial application.  The proposed research will thus add to our overall understanding in these important areas."

A closely related space is the Teichmueller space of Riemann surfaces where the mapping class group acts, and the quotient is equal to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.<br/>The mapping class group is a basic group intensively studied in geometric group theory. The Teichmueller space and hence the moduli space of Riemann surfaces admit several natural Riemannian metrics such as the Weil-Petersson metric, the Ricci metric and Poincare type metrics. The main goal of this proposal is to study the spectral theory of the moduli space with respect to these Riemannian metrics and to understand its relations with the geometry and topology of the moduli space. Pursuing similarities between the moduli space and locally symmetric spaces, and between mapping class groups and arithmetic groups has been fruitful, the second goal of this proposal is to study some related problems for locally symmetric spaces. Specifically, the proposal consists of the following 4 projects:<br/>(1) Spectral theory of the incomplete Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space.<br/>(2) Spectral theory for complete Riemannian metrics on the moduli space: geometric scattering theory.<br/>(3) Simplicial volume and spines of the moduli space.<br/>(4) Equivariant spines of symmetric spaces and L^p-spectral theory of locally symmetric spaces.<br/><br/><br/>A drum corresponds to a domain in the plane, and its tones correspond to the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator of the domain with the Dirichlet boundary condition. A perhaps naive question is how these eigenvalues are related to and reflect the shape of the drum, i.e., the geometry of the domain. For example, a very large drum has a low pitch. A famous question raised by Marc Kac in 1966 is ""Can one hear the shape of a drum?"". This question has been one of the motivating forces for the subject of spectral geometry. Domains are special examples of Riemannian manifolds, and mathematicians have been trying to understand geometry and spectral theory of various Riemannian manifolds, for example, closed surfaces inside the three dimensional Euclidean space. An important class of spaces comes from collections of mathematical objects sharing similar properties, the so-called moduli spaces. The main purpose of this proposal is to understand the geometry and spectral of  moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces."

We introduced various innovations into our current training program, and will continue them and expand on them:  We will provide intensive exploratory seminars, lecture series and workshops.  All trainees will develop lecturing skills, and will benefit from intensive mentoring.  Some trainees will deepen their scientific training by traveling to other institutions at the forefront of research.  Finally, we will expose undergraduates to research in the these areas via REU's.  We involve postdocs in REU activities, thus training them to supervise research. <br/><br/>Geometry, topology and dynamical systems are core areas of mathematics. Geometry investigates the shape of spaces, through invariants such as curvature.  Topology explores the properties of spaces which remain invariant under continuous deformations.  One basic such invariant, the genus, is the number of ""holes"" in a surface.  Dynamical systems concern the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time.  Especially in recent years, geometry and dynamics have developed in mutually beneficial interaction.  Case in point are topology, geometry  and complex dynamics in low dimension which in many aspects mirror each other.  Many of the most exciting developments in these areas are truly interrelated, and benefit from each other either by idea, analogy or actual tool.  At the same time, connections with other fields such as group theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics have strengthened dramatically.

The PI plans to study some fundamental problems in three inter-related areas: Constant rank arguments in complex variables; totally real submanifolds of complex manifolds; and fully nonlinear equations in Hermitian manifolds. A very important theme in the area of geometric analysis is that understanding the solutions to some partial differential equations in terms of metrics, curvatures, or other geometric forms can be used to obtain more information about the geometry and topology of the manifolds. Under this consideration, in the study of complex geometry, the class of plurisubharmonic functions plays a crucial role. In her previous works, the PI has obtained, along with some important applications, a general constant rank result about the complex Hessian matrix of the solution to certain partial differential equations, which can be viewed as a refined statement of plurisubharmonicity. Along this direction, further study could be focused on discovering more geometric properties by the powerful tool of the constant rank argument. In the second part of the project, the PI is determined to discuss some nice geometric structures of real submanifolds in complex settings by studying the Dirichlet problem of a homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere equation whose solution characterizes a smooth totally real submanifold. In a recent joint work with B.Guan, the PI has established an optimal regularity result for such solutions. We would discover more interesting properties of the rich geometry that the totally real submanifolds provide us in this project. The last part of the proposed research is motivated from the first two and a natural continuation of a joint project with B. Guan about the complex Monge-Ampere equations in Hermitian manifolds. The PI with her collaborator would like to investigate some fully nonlinear equations under the general Hermitian setting, where the non-trivial torsion term gives us much trouble in the analysis. <br/><br/>The proposed project links a wide range of active fields of mathematics, in particular, nonlinear partial differential equations, differential geometry, pluri-potential theory, and classical analysis, and furthermore in the broader fields of other subjects in sciences. Problems in this proposal arise naturally from our attempt to understand the behavior of solutions to nonlinear differential equations from geometry. The proposed research activity on geometry and regularity of nonlinear partial differential equations may bring in new and innovative progresses and lead to other significant geometric applications."

More precisely, the PI focuses on singularity analysis of possible finite time singularities occurring in those evolution equations. Such equations appear in quantum field theory, plasma physics,  thin liquid film dynamics. More precisely, one of the things the PI wants to study is the regularity of nonlinear geometric flows, such as finding the minimal geometric conditions that will guarantee the smooth existence of a solution to the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The other thing the PI would like to understand are the ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows and their classification. It is well known that ancient solutions arise as singularity models (blown up limits) at finite time singularities. Their classification is crucial for better understanding the singularities that may occur in finite time. Ancient solutions to the two dimensional Ricci flow  describe trajectories of the renormalization group equations of certain asymptotically free local quantum field theories in the ultra-violet regime. One special class of ancient solutions are Ricci solitons. The PI would like to study those, having an ultimate goal of classifying generic singularities of a generic Ricci flow.  <br/><br/>The project the PI proposes  links many different active fields of mathematics, such as nonlinear analysis, differential geometry and topology. The proposed research activity on singularity analysis and regularity of nonlinear parabolic geometric evolution equations may result in interesting applications in geometry and topology. There may be potential application in physics as well. It is well known that the Ricci flow theory has lead to a solution of the Poincare conjecture in topology. The hope is that geometric flows may help solving other important topological question such as the classification of manifolds in higher dimensions.  One of the main obstacles in order to even approach such a difficult question like that by using the flow theory is understanding the singularity formation and the classification of singularities, since one can not hope the flow will exist forever. Most likely it will develop singularities in finite time. The PI proposes to understand the formation of singularities in the flows such as the Ricci flow, mean curvature flow, the Yamabe flow  and therefore contribute to finding a way to approach the big mentioned problem above."

One general area of concentration will be that of singularity formation in the Ricci flow, with an emphasis on the study of ancient solutions and Ricci solitons. A central theme in the theory developed by Hamilton, Perelman, and others, is that the local geometry of a developing singularity possesses a relatively rigid structure, modelled, in many important cases, upon these special types of solutions.  It is thus desirable to have as detailed a knowledge as possible of the diversity of forms which they can assume.<br/>Additionally, the co-PI proposes to investigate Type-II singularity development  and the question of unique continuation for the Ricci flow equation.  Another general area of concentration will be curvature flows of hypersurfaces, with an emphasis on the application, interpretation, and further development of differential Harnack inequalities for these flows. One aim will be to refine such inequalities in the setting of evolving spacelike hypersurfaces in Minkowski space, with an eye toward the study of eternal solutions and translating solitons.  In the case of the mean curvature flow, the latter objects are of interest to researchers in general relativity as natural foliations of Lorentzian spacetimes.  In another direction, the co-PI proposes to pursue a potential connection from this setting to the cross-curvature flow, an intrinsic flow of potential use in the study of three-manifolds with negative curvature.<br/><br/>The Ricci flow and other geometric evolution equations considered in this proposal are representatives of the ""heat-flow"" method in geometry, the techniques and objectives of which straddle the field's lively interface with topology, analysis, and mathematical physics.<br/>This method has proven effective in attacking certain cases of one of the most fundamental questions in mathematics, namely, which manifolds admit constant curvature or otherwise canonical geometries? Not only does this question have ramifications for physical models of the universe, but the development of tools attendant to the approach promise to pay continued dividends to the analysis of the many structurally similar nonlinear PDE which occur as models of diverse phenomena throughout the physical sciences.<br/><br/><br/>"

In its simplest form, the isoperimetric problem asks which shape of a closed curve with a given length can cover the largest area on a plane. In modern mathematics, isoperimetric problems play an important role in many fields, notably in geometry, analysis, probability theory, and group theory. The present project aims at gaining a deeper understanding of the connections between isoperimetric problems and problems from other fields, such as for example large scale geometry, a field which has been influential in many branches of mathematics in recent years. Roughly speaking, large scale (or asymptotic) geometry is the study of geometric properties of objects ""seen from far away"". From this perspective, a dotted line for example is indistinguishable from a solid one."

The first project will build on the PI's work with Tosatti which gave an analogue of Yau's Theorem for compact Hermitian manifolds.  The PI proposes to generalize these estimates and apply them to obtain new results on the Bott-Chern space of a complex manifold.  The second project deals with the Kahler-Ricci flow - which can be regarded as the parabolic complex Monge-Ampere equation - on algebraic varieties.  As part of a program to understand the analytic minimal model program, the PI and Song investigated the Kahler-Ricci flow on algebraic varieties and gave necessary conditions under which the flow contracts an exceptional divisor.  The PI proposes to extend these results to deal with more general singularities and also to study the behavior of the curvature tensor along the Kahler-Ricci flow.  The final project concerns the Calabi-Yau equation on symplectic manifolds.  Donaldson conjectured that the complex Monge-Ampere equation solved by Yau has an analogue for symplectic 4-manifolds with compatible almost complex structures.<br/>He gave applications of his conjecture to symplectic topology. Special cases of Donaldson's conjecture were established by the PI and his co-authors.  The PI will undertake an analysis of the structure of the blow-up set for the Calabi-Yau equation, with the ultimate goal of proving Donaldson's conjecture.<br/><br/>An important problem in mathematics, and physics, is to understand the interaction between geometry and differential equations.  This proposal concerns a well-known and centuries-old mathematical object called the Monge-Ampere equation.  This equation arises naturally in the study of geometry and is closely related to Einstein's equations in physics.  A main goal of this project is to find applications of the Monge-Ampere equation to more general and commonly occuring geometric objects where it was not previously known that a connection exists.  By finding new relationships between this classical differential equation and geometry, the PI aims to further our understanding of what kind of geometric structures can exist.  In addition, the Monge-Ampere equation is deeply related to geometry via an associated heat flow.  It is expected that this heat flow will help us understand some old and difficult problems concerning solutions to algebraic equations.  Indeed, the solutions of algebraic equations define geometric objects, and the heat flow deforms these objects and can extract information from them.  The PI will investigate the precise behavior of the Monge-Ampere heat flow on such geometric objects."

This entails having a program of visitors in the field at all levels and for varying durations and holding four conferences in the field during the course of the year.  Microlocal analysis is analysis in phase space.  It is the mathematics underpinning the semi-classical limit in quantum mechanics, as well as having applications in other areas of physics and geometry.  The proposed project would bring together researchers using microlocal methods in widely disparate contexts, ranging from quantum mechanics to representation theory, complex geometry, and mirror symmetry.  The central feature of the emphasis year is to be a program of four workshops, as well as mini-courses from visiting mathematicians.  The topics of the workshops will be: (i) Algebraic Microlocal Analysis (D-modules and deformation quantization); (ii) Analytic Microlocal Analysis (microlocal analysis in the complex domain); (iii) Spectral and Scattering theory in the C-infinity setting; (iv) Nonlinear Evolution Equations. These four workshops represent quite distinct areas of microlocal analysis, reflecting the major areas of concentration in the field at Northwestern. The workshop on Analytic Microlocal Analysis is intended to unify and bridge the different areas.  Many of the technical triumphs in microlocal analysis lack approachable expositions, and the emphasis year should help make microlocal tools more accessible to researchers in many fields.<br/><br/>Microlocal Analysis is a part of analysis and geometry that studies functions, differential equations, and other objects on a space in terms of its phase space. A point of the phase space describes a position of a particle on the original space together with its momentum. In particular, its dimension is double that of the original space. The phase space plays a fundamental role in classical and quantum mechanics, as well as in optics (as the space of light rays) and other parts of physics. There are more general types of phase spaces, called symplectic manifolds. In particular, large classes of complex manifolds, or geometric spaces based not on real but on complex numbers, are in this class. There are other, less well-understood, connections between symplectic manifolds and complex manifolds; they are expressed by the mirror symmetry, an area of both string theory and geometry. All this suggests that microlocal methods play crucial role in many areas of mathematics and physics. In fact these areas spread all the way from quantum field theory to differential geometry to complex analysis to number theory.  The goal of the Emphasis Year at Northwestern is to bring together leading researchers working in these different areas.<br/>More information can be found on the website:<br/>http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~dbaskin/spscconf/"

He will also conduct research in several parts of spectral geometry on singular spaces, including the study of analytic torsion on manifolds with edges and on smooth manifolds degenerating conically, and on more classical spectral problems on the space of polygons. Other parts of this project include the analysis of a class of degenerate parabolic problems on piecewise smooth, e.g. polyhedral, domains, arising from the Wright-Fisher model in population genetics. He is also investigating the regularity theory for a nonlinear Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator which arises in the study of properly embedded minimal surfaces in hyperbolic space. Finally, he is also analyzing the singular solutions of a class of semilinear Toda-like elliptic systems, which has direct application to some newly introduced string field theories.<br/><br/>In general terms, Mazzeo's research is driven by the central tenet that certain types of singular spaces -- specifically the ones known as stratified spaces -- arise just as naturally as smooth manifolds,  which are the most common objects of study in geometry, and both classes of spaces should be considered as comparably important. However, the foundations of geometric analysis on singular spaces are still in a relatively primitive state, and Mazzeo's work is aimed at developing techniques which are meant to be broadly applicable to many natural geometric and analytic problems, both linear and nonlinear, on such spaces. This work is guided by a close examination of many particular problems of recognized importance, arising from both commonly studied questions in pure mathematics and from problems emerging at the interface of mathematics and physics.  The expectation is that these natural problems will drive the formulation of the general theory so as to make it accessible and useful, and in turn, this new set of techniques should help answer many problems of interest in these established fields."

Some of these techniques are constructive, such as the proposed construction of the forward fundamental solution and the scattering operator on a class of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces, while others rely on phase-space energy estimates, such as the microlocal positive commutator estimates that are expected to be of use in the study of the asymptotic behavior of the wave equation on curved space-times (such as Kerr-de Sitter space, describing rotating black holes), of wave equations with global conditions replacing initial conditions, and in wave propagation on curved space-times with asymptotic edges and cusps.

For instance, scattering phenomena enter into the description of quantum waves on large scales, mathematically modelled as ""infinity."" As propagation phenomena are ubiquitous in the physical world, their more precise understanding has many potential applications.

As an important evolutionary equation, it sets up a bridge between geometry and topology. In the past three decades, there have been many exciting achievements of the Ricci flow. In 2002, Perelman used the Ricci flow to solve the folklore Poincare conjecture. In 2007, Richard Schoen and Simon Brendle used the Ricci flow to prove the famous sphere theorem. These examples and many others highlight one fact that the Ricci flow is a powerful tool which deserves intensive study. The success of these previous examples is based on the knowledge of the global behavior of the Ricci flows with special conditions. Specially, either the dimension of the underlying manifold is three, or the curvature operator (or isotropic curvature) is nonnegative.  However, in a general higher dimensional Ricci flow, we can hardly determine the sign of the curvature operator. The global picture of the Ricci flow is still unclear. There remain a lot of technical  difficulties to overcome. Therefore, the study of the Ricci flows with weaker curvature constraints becomes natural and necessary. The Ricci flows' behavior under sectional curvature and Ricci curvature bounds have been solved by Hamilton and Sesum.  Naturally, the next step is to understand the behavior of the Ricci flow under the condition that scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. On the other hand, Perelman's fundamental work reveals that there are many Ricci flows where scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. Therefore, the Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature deserve comprehensive study. My research proposal is to study these Ricci flows.<br/><br/>The Ricci flow is an evolution equation solution on a Riemannian manifold. The Ricci flow is an important tool to find Einstein metrics, which are crucial in general relativity and mirror symmetry, my study is closely related to physics and Kahler geometry.  It naturally interacts with mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, complex analysis and partial differential equations.  Therefore, the study of the Ricci flow has broader impact outside the area of geometric analysis.  Among all Ricci flows, the Ricci flow with bounded scalar curvature is a very important type. This type of Ricci flows appear naturally in many settings. For example, according to the deep work of Perelman, the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded along the Ricci flows on many Kahler manifolds. My research proposal focuses on the study of the Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature. The success of this project will greatly benefit the understanding of properties of many Riemannian manifolds."

Understanding the geometric nature of the latter objects is the major open problem in conformal field theory. Another goal is to elucidate the role of Bott-Chern secondary characteristic forms for holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles, with application to complex geometry. The immediate goal of the algebraic side is to introduce a symplectic structure on the suitably defined algebraic de Rham cohomology to study the eigenvalues of correspondences on curves in characteristic 0 and characteristic p cases. Long term goals of the algebraic side are the following: 1) to use a representation of the WZW model as a theory of free fields to define non-abelian quantum field theories on algebraic curves in characteristic zero, with application to reciprocity laws; 2) to develop ""algebraic harmonic analysis"" on adeles when the corresponding residue class field is not a finite field. This will advance our understanding of ""differential and integral calculus"" on algebraic curves and its applications, possibly with analogs for the fields of algebraic numbers.   <br/><br/>The last thirty five years have been characterized by remarkable interaction between mathematics and physics, which lead to fundamental discoveries in various mathematics disciplines, bringing together the areas that were thought to be apart. In many cases a successful application of methods of quantum fields and strings consists of ""probing"" mathematical objects with physical theories and translating the physics ""output""  back into the realm of mathematics. When probing mathematical objects by quantum field theory, the mathematical output is encoded in partition function and various correlation functions of quantum fields, defined by Feynman path integral, usually given in terms of perturbation expansion, and expressed through the critical value of the classical action and so-called ""quantum corrections.""  Symmetries of the theory manifest themselves in Ward identities - fundamental relations between partition function and correlation functions, and in many cases they give new and unexpected mathematical results. Proper understanding and exploitation of these symmetries is at the heart of today's applications of quantum physics to different mathematical disciplines. Realization of the main goals of the proposal will significantly contribute to the fundamental interface between mathematics and physics. This applies to the complex-analytic part, as well as to the algebraic part; the fundamental properties of the latter are discrete, and to study them at microscopic scale one uses quantum theory. In particular, many classical mathematical results related to the fields of algebraic functions and algebraic numbers, known as reciprocity laws, can be interpreted as conservation laws (like conservation of energy) in quantum theory. The main goal of the algebraic part of the project is to develop this analogy further by formulating ""differential and integral calculus"", and to develop an approach based on the algebraic version of the Green's function, which is a fundamental object of classical analysis and mathematical physics, and is extensively used in quantum field theory."

The first proposed problem is on the rigidity of certain asymptotically flat manifolds. This project is a continuation of the investigator's earlier work on asymptotic decay of metrics where she applied an analysis method in elliptic systems. The elliptic systems therein are of reaction-diffusion type, which appears often in biology and chemistry. The rigidity problem can be viewed as an extremal case of the asymptotic decay problem of metrics. The second proposed project is on partial regularity of geometric elliptic systems under L^2 norm bound of curvatures. Such problem arises naturally in the study of moduli spaces. The notion of moduli spaces is a modern advance in describing the topological and analytical structure of Riemannian metrics. The investigator  proposes  to study the regularity theory by a similar analysis approach previously used in harmonic maps and Yang-Mills equations.<br/><br/>The proposed research contains  an interdisciplinary study among differential geometry and applied  mathematics through partial differential equations. On the geometrical side, both problems are within a larger program in understanding  the structure of Riemannian metrics on the whole. In order to describe the structure, it is essential to develop a tool, partial regularity, to measure the roughness of the space. From analytical point of view, the problems turn out  to be characterized by a (static) reaction-diffusion system, a typical type of systems in some areas  of sciences. In the literature of partial regularity in geometry,  there were few connections known in this direction ( harmonic maps and Yang-Mills equations are among the few). The investigator plans to devote herself in this direction and disseminate the knowledge she obtained through the proposed activity among both differential geometers and applied mathematicians."

A ""classical geometry"" means the structure of a manifold invariant under a transitive action of a Lie group. For a fixed topology, the space of such structures is a natural object, with a rich geometry and symmetry of its own, associated with the topology and the homogeneous space.  The study of deformation spaces of geometric structures was initiated by Charles Ehresmann in the 1930's. It unifies what have been disparate areas of research in the 19th century (crystallography, holomorphic differential equations and conformal mapping, development of projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry). The subject became prominent through the influence of William Thurston in the 1970's.  The prototype of this theory is the space of hyperbolic geometry structures on a closed surface, which by the classical uniformization theorem, identifies with the Teichmueller space of the surface. Our project explores three recent developments - geometric structures on 3-manifolds, higher Thurston-Teichmueller theory, and Anosov representations - where the rich structure of Teichmueller space generalizes to deformation spaces of more complicated geometries.  The intimate relations of this subject with many other fields of mathematics underscores its central role in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project synthesizes disparate mathematical subjects: the topology of manifolds, various kinds of geometry, algebra and dynamics. The Moebius band is an example of a two dimensional manifold with only one side. It describes, for example, the collection of all straight lines in the plane.  The universe we live in is an example of a three dimensional manifold.  The position and velocity of a satellite or missile is described by a point in a six-dimensional manifold. Different kinds of geometries distinguish special properties of manifolds.  The Moebius band is naturally described using the projective geometry inspired by the work of Renaissance painters. Cartographers used conformal geometry to produce more accurate maps of the world. Differential geometry enabled Einstein to develop his theory of gravitation. Chemists use the algebra of groups to classify crystals. The periodic table of chemical elements is intimately connected to the group of rotations of space.  Much of this mathematical landscape remains unexplored.  Using modern computers, students can contribute to this investigation.  The exploration of explicit examples and their interactions provides problems for talented students, inviting them to the excitement of mathematical research."

Another objective (in the opposite direction) is to understand related non-existence, characterization, and uniqueness questions.  Achieving these objectives requires the refinement of the known methodology and also the development of entirely new methods.  In the first project of this proposal, the PI aims to study in collaboration with Mark Haskins important special Lagrangian and other calibrated submanifolds. In particular they intend to continue to study special Lagrangian cones in $\mathbb{C}^n$ controlled by ODE systems and related in various ways to the Lawlor necks, some of them invariant under the action of $SO(p)\times SO(n-p)$; their use as building blocks for gluing constructions for new special Lagrangian cones; and uniqueness questions for these objects (for which the known theory seems inadequate because of the high codimension).  In other projects, the PI, alone or in collaboration, intends to continue his work on generalizing his earlier desingularization and doubling constructions for minimal surfaces in three-manifolds to the greatest possible extent, and apply these constructions to fundamental questions in the theory of minimal surfaces, for example to a question of Yau about the existence of infinitely many minimal surfaces in any Riemannian three-manifold. The PI also intends to study existence and classification questions for minimal surfaces in the round three-sphere, including characterizations of a topological nature for the Lawson surfaces. In a collaboration with F. Martin and W. Meeks, the PI intends to work on desingularization constructions where there are triple points of intersection so that they can be used to understand the Calabi-Yau problem for minimal surfaces in the embedded case.  In collaboration with Stephen Kleene and Niels Moller, the PI intends to work on existence questions for self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow.  In collaboration with Christine Breiner, the PI intends to expand his earlier work on gluing constructions for constant mean curvature surfaces.<br/><br/>Minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces have historically been an important field where many important ideas were first developed, and later applied to nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, General Relativity, Einstein manifolds, and other fields.  This is not surprising because in some sense the theory combines important features of all these fields while it is at the same time the simplest and most intuitive.  Although enormous progress has been made, there are many fundamental questions which are completely open, mostly because the known methodologies are inadequate. Successful completion of these pending projects would answer many important such questions and would be the basis for progress in the related fields as well."

Of particular interest are equations that prescribe higher-order curvature invariants that control the global geometry of higher dimensional manifolds.

A key difficulty in handling such equations is the absence of a maximum principle, and the principal investigators propose to compensate for its absence by using integral inequalities as the main working tool.

It asserts that the results of any measurements of the physical universe in the Einstein space can be predicted by taking another set of measurements near the ""far end"" of the universe (which is referred to as its ""boundary""). A case of particular interest is the situation when the boundary space is three-dimensional, a case in which geometric understanding is already well developed.

We are particularly interested in hypersurfaces that are in general or generic position before the flow start. The mean curvature flow is the negative gradient flow of volume, so any hypersurface flows through hypersurfaces in the direction of steepest descent for volume and eventually becomes extinct in finite time. Before it becomes extinct, topological changes can occur as it goes through singularities. Thus, in some sense, the topology is encoded in the singularities. The proposed project further develops the theory of generic mean curvature flow that the PI has initiated with Minicozzi. We have already classified all generic singularities and one of the main task now is to completely understand the flow itself and show that indeed a generic hypersurface only go through generic singularities. The first key point is to prove a stable manifold theorem, that is, to prove that in a neighborhood of an unstable self-shrinker the stable manifold is contained in a hyper-graph. We expect that these results will have a number of applications and plan to pursue them. A second part concerns manifolds and spaces with Ricci curvature bounds and give some new estimates for these manifolds and various applications of these estimates, in particular to Einstein metrics. A third part concerns representations of isometry groups and fundamental groups of open manifolds into general linear groups of finite dimensional vector spaces. The final and smaller part is about bounds for nodal sets (or zero sets) of eigenfunctions. <br/><br/>When a surface evolves over time by locally moving it in the direction where the area decreases the fastest it is said to be moving by mean curvature flow. Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation which is formally similar to the equation that governs the flow of heat in physics. Moving interfaces occur in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. Mean curvature flow and other geometric flows were developed for their intrinsic beauty as well as their potential applications to other fields to model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in annealing metals, and crystal growth. While key foundational results have been obtained, several of the most basic questions remain unanswered. Many applications are expected both within and outside mathematics."

The relation between<br/>algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, combinatorics, random<br/>matrix theory, topology, integrable systems, and string theory in<br/>the Gromov-Witten theory was apparent in the early 1990s. After a<br/>long time of extremely fruitful developments in each individual<br/>area, we are back to a new level of interaction once<br/>again. Instead of pushing an existing problem or conjecture, the<br/>proposed project is aimed at understanding a new point of<br/>view.

The<br/>PI has organized several workshops specifically aimed at this<br/>subject in the last two and a half years, which were attended by<br/>many young researchers.

A ""classical geometry"" means the structure of a manifold invariant under a transitive action of a Lie group. For a fixed topology, the space of such structures is a natural object, with a rich geometry and symmetry of its own, associated with the topology and the homogeneous space.  The study of deformation spaces of geometric structures was initiated by Charles Ehresmann in the 1930's. It unifies what have been disparate areas of research in the 19th century (crystallography, holomorphic differential equations and conformal mapping, development of projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry). The subject became prominent through the influence of William Thurston in the 1970's.  The prototype of this theory is the space of hyperbolic geometry structures on a closed surface, which by the classical uniformization theorem, identifies with the Teichmueller space of the surface. Our project explores three recent developments - geometric structures on 3-manifolds, higher Thurston-Teichmueller theory, and Anosov representations - where the rich structure of Teichmueller space generalizes to deformation spaces of more complicated geometries.  The intimate relations of this subject with many other fields of mathematics underscores its central role in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project synthesizes disparate mathematical subjects: the topology of manifolds, various kinds of geometry, algebra and dynamics. The Moebius band is an example of a two dimensional manifold with only one side. It describes, for example, the collection of all straight lines in the plane.  The universe we live in is an example of a three dimensional manifold.  The position and velocity of a satellite or missile is described by a point in a six-dimensional manifold. Different kinds of geometries distinguish special properties of manifolds.  The Moebius band is naturally described using the projective geometry inspired by the work of Renaissance painters. Cartographers used conformal geometry to produce more accurate maps of the world. Differential geometry enabled Einstein to develop his theory of gravitation. Chemists use the algebra of groups to classify crystals. The periodic table of chemical elements is intimately connected to the group of rotations of space.  Much of this mathematical landscape remains unexplored.  Using modern computers, students can contribute to this investigation.  The exploration of explicit examples and their interactions provides problems for talented students, inviting them to the excitement of mathematical research."

The motivation of such an extension of harmonic maps is for their application in superrigidity, geometric group theory, minimal surface theory and character varieties.  The PI proposes to explore the interplay between analysis and group theory via harmonic maps.  From the analysis point of view, it is a central problem to determine under what conditions harmonic maps are regular and, if not, to determine the structure of the singular sets.  From a group theory point of view, harmonic map theory is an important tool in studying rigidity questions.  Among the specific problem that will be investigated using harmonic maps are: rigidity properties of NPC (non-positively curved) spaces, quadratic differentials and Teichmuller theory of complexes and the theory of singular minimal surfaces. <br/><br/>The notion of energy has its origins in the mathematical description of the physical world.  Roughly speaking, the energy of a map between two spaces measures the total stretch of the map, and harmonic maps are the critical points of the energy functional.  Thus, the understanding of harmonic maps is of great interest to both mathematicians and physicists.  Harmonic maps are important because they are analytical objects that can be used to represent geometric, topological and algebraic objects associated to a space.   They have numerous actual and potential applications in many fields of mathematics or well as in other sciences."

This is currently the most<br/>general and most comprehensive theory of symplectic<br/>invariants. There are three ingredients to this project, namely<br/>the polyfold Fredholm theory, the scale-smooth analysis and the<br/>formulation of SFT as an algebraic presentation of the solution<br/>count of a polyfold Fredholm problem with operations.  The second<br/>subproject, a by-product of the polyfold Fredholm theory,<br/>attempts to construct a homology theory based on equivalence<br/>classes of Fredholm problems. The resulting advantage would be<br/>that transversality issues in studying nonlinear partial<br/>differential equations would actually not occur explicitly. They<br/>would be hidden in the (one-time) proof that the new homology<br/>theory of a space would be naturally isomorphic to the rational<br/>singular homology.  A third subproject is concerned with finite<br/>energy foliations, either in the context of area-preserving<br/>disk-maps or the restricted planar three-body problem. Finite<br/>energy foliations were introduced by the PI and his collaborators<br/>and are an important tool in the study of the dynamics of<br/>low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems.

More specifically, the CAREER Award will fund Pelayo's investigations on classical and quantum semitoric systems. A classical semitoric system is an integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom for which one component generates a periodic flow. For mathematicians, semitoric systems form the next natural class of systems after toric systems. Semitoric systems retain some properties of toric systems, while at the same time they exhibit a much greater flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in the existence of singularities which are dynamically and symplectically rich.Semitoric systems are commonly found in simple physical models and arise naturally as examples in analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry. As a matter of fact, a semitoric system defines a singular toric fibration whose base comes endowed with a singular integral affine structure. These singular affine structures are a central concept in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry. A semitoric quantum system is given by two commuting self-adjoint semiclassical operators acting on a Hilbert space whose principal symbols form a classical semitoric system. One of Pelayo's main goals is  to study the spectral theory of semitoric quantum systems and how it relates to classical systems. Concretely, Pelayo's plan is to work towards verifying that the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system determines completely the system; this is the Spectral Conjecture, widely considered the most spectacular problem in the area.  Proving this conjecture requires establishing a number of results in semiclassical analysis, giving a tool for future research in the field, independent of the conjecture. Another component of Pelayo's research plans is to continue studying semitoric systems in a more general context, in particular as it regards to the study of the convexity and connectivity properties of the singular Lagrangian fibrations which semitoric systems induce, and which are of special interest in mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The research that the CAREER Award will support belongs to the context of  dynamics and geometry.  Dynamics  is the study of the motion of bodies. Geometry is the study of shape (broadly understood) of objects and spaces.More specifically, the CAREER Award will support Pelayo's research at the intersection of symplectic geometry, spectral theory  and dynamics. Symplectic geometry has its roots in physics, and provides an appropriate mathematical framework to study many problems of physics and chemistry and their quantum counterparts. Pelayo's research on this topic exhibits the interplay between mathematical and physical theories. Indeed, several groups of physicists and chemists working on modern quantum spectroscopy have been interested in seeing how mathematical methods can  contribute to advance their research, and predict new physical phenomena. They have been particularly interested in understanding the global structure of joint energy-momentum spectra of small molecules. Even more, they have recognized the pivotal role that mathematical invariants play in this problem. Their works have motivated a large number of mathematical questions. The physicists have asked whether one can single out an optimal set of mathematical invariants that would characterize a physical system and then detect these invariants in the spectrum of the system.  The detection of the invariants in the system spectrum will allow us to reconstruct the system and hence predict new phenomena. The CAREER Award will support Pelayo's investigations into this crucial question.  These applications to quantum molecular spectroscopy are integrated in Pelayo's approach of employing methods from pure mathematics (symplectic and spectral theory, microlocal analysis) to address problems from the applied sciences. More generally,  Pelayo's  research is focused on a fundamental type of physical system, the so called integrable systems. One can find direct applications of integrable systems in numerous contexts. Some such examples are nonlinear control,  locomotion generation in robotics, elasticity theory, plasma physics, field theory and planetary mission design. In order to communicate this relevance of mathematical research to the general public, Pelayo has been interviewed on several occasions by the press (radio and magazines with several hundred thousand audience members). He has commented and advocated for an understanding of the leading role that mathematicians play in the advance of applied science and technology in society. Pelayo will continue actively reaching out to the general public during the tenure of the award, and will continue to take a leading role at Washington University outreach programs. In this respect he will run a  Talent Identification Program at Washington University to encourage and nurture undergraduate research at an early stage."

An important problem is to understand compactness of moduli spaces and existence of critical metrics, such as anti-self-dual and extremal Kaehler metrics. With certain geometric noncollapsing assumptions, the appropriate moduli spaces can be compactified by adding metrics with orbifold-like singularities. A long-term goal is to extend the compactness theorem to include the possibility of collapsing, and to find other applications to the differential topology of four-manifolds. In dimension four, critical points of the Weyl energy are known as Bach-flat metrics, which contains the class of anti-self-dual metrics. Such metrics have very interesting properties, and can be studied using twistor theory. In higher dimensions, the PI will investigate quadratic curvature functionals, and their variational properties, such as stability and rigidity of critical points. This has applications to volume comparison theorems and gluing results.  The PI is also interested in non-compact examples of critical metrics, such as asymptotically locally Euclidean critical metrics, and obtaining optimal decay rates for such spaces. This has applications to the understanding of the structure of moduli spaces, and to the removal of singularities.<br/><br/>An important motivation for the research of the PI is to understand the relationship between the geometry and the topology of a space. The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles (the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is less appealing that the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which minimizes the total energy.  This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of the our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. The projects described above are to define appropriate energies on such spaces, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy."

Professor Wang plans to continue his research on the mean curvature flow of Lagrangian submanifolds. Immediate goals include proving the global existence and convergence of the flow in two cases (1) graphs of symplectomorphisms of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds (2) exact Lagrangian submanifolds of cotangent bundles, and applying these results to Lagrangian isotopy problems.<br/><br/><br/>Due to the non-local feature of gravitational energy, the ADM or Bondi mass only finds its expression at infinity where gravitation is weak. However, most observable physical models are finitely extended regions and measurement of mass/energy on such a region is essential in many fundamental issues in GR.

The proposed research will further our understanding of gravitational energy in large scale and of problems related to black holes. Professor Wang purposes to study the ``mean curvature flow"" of surfaces. This flow is like the heat equation which dissipates curvature distributions and deforms a surface into an equilibrium state. He plans to apply this flow to connect a general surface to ones with optimal shape. This procedure will help us understand the geometry and topology of such surfaces. It is also important in applied areas such as computer graphics and image processing."

In particular he will investigate the role of level sets of solutions of differential equations. Special cases of level sets are given by the nodal sets, the singular sets and the branch sets. An important part of the study is the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of solutions near these sets or the asymptotic behavior of these sets themselves. The differential equations may be elliptic, hyperbolic or of mixed type. Some problems have close connections with other fields in mathematics, including several complex variables and algebraic geometry. Another class of problems that the PI will continue to work on involves the effect of level sets of known functions in the equations on the existence and properties of solutions. A particular problem is the isometric embedding of 2-dim Riemannian manifolds in 3-space when the zero set of Gauss curvature is well behaved. This problem is in the form of degenerate Monge-Ampere equations. <br/><br/>The problems involving nodal sets or the singular sets originate from materials science and control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those sets where singularities occur. Precise definitions vary depending on the problems where they arise. It often is impossible to eliminate the singular sets, the so-called ""bad sets"". One of the central tasks is to identify the conditions under which the singular sets can be controlled and the conditions under which the singular sets are small. The proposed problems concerning singular sets in the project are in their simplest forms. They are related to the Erickson's model for liquid crystals and the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the superconductivity. The PI believes that the discussion of these mathematical problems will help scientists work with singular sets in various applications."

In past proposals  the principal investigator has used this approach to produce many new examples of non-negative curvature, including some on exotic spheres. Recently he also constructed a new example of positive curvature among an infinite family of candidates he discovered in previous proposals, and found an obstruction to one of these candidates as well. The principal investigator plans to study these candidates in more detail in the hope of finding more examples of positive curvature. The new obstruction is quite general and needs to be explored in more detail for actions with large isometry group, for example polar actions. Its implications without the presence of an isometric group action will be explored as well. There are many questions of a more general nature within this subject of ``non-negative sectional curvature with large isometry groups"" that the principal investigator plans to study. Finally, as was done in past proposals with success, studying topological properties of new and known examples can be very difficult but also very rewarding.<br/><br/>Manifolds with positive sectional curvature can be defined by the property that the sum of the 3 angles in any triangle is larger than 180 degrees, i.e. their geometry is similar to that of the round sphere. Global Riemannian geometry can be described as relating local stretching and bending to the global shape of space. Since the beginning of global Riemannian geometry, manifolds with positive or more generally non-negative curvature have been an important part of this subject. Nevertheless one still has few obstructions to the existence of such geometries, especially if one wants to distinguish between those manifolds that admit non-negative sectional curvature and those that admit positive sectional curvature. Unfortunately one also has few examples with  non-negative  curvature and even rarer are examples with  positive curvature. It is thus of paramount importance to construct new examples, one of goals of this proposal."

Among the specific problems and areas that he intends to investigate are these:  In affine geometry, he will investigate the new integrable systems that he has discovered while working on the affine Bonnet problem.  In Riemannian geometry, he will continue his work on classifying Riemannian submersions from space forms and other symmetric spaces, work on classifying special metrics (such as solitons and metrics with restrictions on the algebraic type of the curvature tensor), and on understanding the integrable systems associated with special holonomy metrics of higher cohomogeneity. In Finsler geometry, Bryant will continue to develop the theory of Finsler manifolds with constant flag curvature, both in constructing new examples and in understanding the properties of their geodesic flows; the relations with twistor theory and exotic holonomy structures will be especially examined.  In complex geometry, Bryant will continue his work on characterizing the rational normal structures induced on the moduli space of rational contact curves in holomorphic contact $3$-folds, with the goal of understanding how these are connected to integrable systems and their curvature properties.  All these (and other related projects) will produce results that are useful in themselves, but they will also motivate the development of new techniques in exterior differential systems and the method of equivalence and will facilitate the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in these techniques.<br/><br/>Many of the important advances in our ability to use mathematics in physics and other sciences have depended on developing a geometric understanding of those problems, i.e., an understanding that focuses only on the aspects of those problems that are not tied to specific (often, arbitrarily chosen) coordinate systems.  For example, Einstein's formulation of General Relativity came only after he was able to employ the coordinate-free concepts of Riemannian geometry effectively to isolate and describe the essential nature of gravity as the curvature of space-time.  However, coordinate-free formulations of a problem often reveal degeneracies that need to be approached by nonstandard tools, such as the theory of differential systems.  Bryant's plan of research, which applies the coordinate-free theories of differential systems and the method of equivalence, will lead to a more fundamental, geometric understanding of a number of problems that arise in the study of surfaces in space, the special structures that arise because of extra or hidden symmetries, and the nature of curvature itself in a number of geometric contexts."

The latter include general compact sets, but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies, or finite sets. One advantage of this setting is that it becomes more probable that inverse problems have a unique solution. Generally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of uniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information than would otherwise be possible. This can lead to algorithms that are more effective when few measurements are available, and less sensitive to measurement errors or noise. Geometric tomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry, Minkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will continue the development of geometric tomography. New directions include fundamental new classification theorems for binary operations between, and symmetrization operations on, compact convex sets or star bodies; development of new tools for dealing with intersections of convex bodies, including an attack on a conjectured stronger form of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality; formulating and proving restricted Brunn-Minkowski inequalities, where the sets involved are contained in some fixed region of Euclidean space or the unit sphere; new algorithms for reconstruction from noisy data, in particular, from section functions, with proof of convergence for origin-symmetric convex bodies; progress towards a solution of Hammer's X-ray problem in higher dimensions and a conjecture on spherical X-rays of convex bodies; extension of previous results on convex and star bodies to log concave and radial measures; various other projects, for example renewed attacks on the discrete Aleksandrov projection problem and new inequalities of the Loomis-Whitney type or their reverses. Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.<br/><br/>CAT scanners are machines that save lives daily. They take X-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the information to create an image of a two-dimensional section of part of the body. The mathematics behind this process is called computerized tomography. It is very successful, but not perfect; the reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better picture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays, causing greater expense and likelihood of side effects. In geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects are allowed - the density of the object is the same everywhere inside it. An example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney. One can use this extra information to find better reconstruction procedures. The scope of geometric tomography is actually much wider. Any measurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered. Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both in mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the geometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside. For example, a new technique called local stereology depends on measurements of planar sections of biological tissue; each section passes through a fixed point, usually the nucleus of a cell, and the measurements can be made optically rather than physically. This project continues the development of several aspects of the mathematics of geometric tomography. Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research."

In particular one seeks necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Kahler Einstein metric on a Fano manifold. The presence of positive curvature makes this extremely difficult to answer and has led to a striking series of conjectures which relate the existence of these special metrics (solutions to the complex Monge-Ampere equation, a fully non-linear p.d.e ) to the algebraic geometry of the pluri-anticanonical images of the manifold. This geometry was suspected to be related to Mumford's deep ""Geometric Invariant Theory"". Recently this speculation has been completely justified by the PI (building upon work of Gang Tian) and it is the aim of this proposal to finish the proof of the ""standard conjectures"" in the Fano case and to develop and extend the entire Theory in the context of representations of algebraic groups. Here the PI hopes to make contact with Mikio Sato's beautiful theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, there are two ways to mathematically approach, or model, a given problem: continuously, or discretely.  These approaches are traditionally mutually exclusive. Analysis (differential equations in particular) is the time honored subject in the continuous domain, combinatorics and algebra (the study of enumerating a finite amount of data) is the hallmark of the discrete approach. In this proposal these two methods come together-the PI will explore the question of how the solution to an equation from analysis might be obtained by an infinite sequence of a purely finite (but large) collection of data. The equation arose in Einsteins' theory of Gravitation, whereas the finite set of data (hyperdiscriminants and resultants) arose in the work of Arthur Cayley a great Victorian era English mathematician."

The quintessential examples of sub-Riemannian settings are the so-called Carnot groups, whose fundamental role in analysis was first highlighted by E. M. Stein. They now occupy a central position not only in the study of hypoelliptic partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and geometric function theory, but also in the applied sciences such as mathematical finance, mechanical engineering, and the neurophysiology of the brain. The most distinctive feature of sub-Riemannian spaces is that the metric structure can be viewed as a constrained geometry, where motion is possible only along a prescribed set of directions, changing from point to point.  The principal investigator has a long-term project aimed at investigating geometric and analytic properties of these structures. More specifically, she proposes to continue her study of the Bernstein problem and of the regularity of minimal surfaces in Carnot groups, to investigate subelliptic boundary value problems, and to develop a regularity theory for fully nonlinear equations of Monge-Ampere type.  Another area of interest in this project is the investigation of elliptic and parabolic free boundary problems that arise naturally in the theory of flame propagation. The principal investigator also intends to study a class of minimization problems in which the relevant functional is modeled after the one introduced by Alt and Caffarelli. In addition, she is interested in exploring variational inequalities of elliptic and parabolic type with obstacles confined to lie in lower dimensional manifolds. One of the main objectives of the proposed research is to prove regularity properties of the free boundary. The necessary tools from harmonic analysis and the theory of partial differential equations for the study of such problems will be developed concurrently. Finally, motivated by the striking analogy between the theories of minimal surfaces and of free boundaries in the Euclidean setting, the principal investigator plans to merge her different lines of research into a yet quite unexplored area, namely, the study of free boundary problems (both of obstacle and Alt-Caffarelli type) in Carnot groups. <br/><br/>The principal investigator has a research program that lies at the interface of the areas of mathematics known as the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. The focus is on the study of analytic and geometric properties of solutions to so-called variational inequalities and partial differential equations involving a system of ""noncommuting"" vector fields. The proposed problems not only turn up in a variety of mathematical contexts (e.g., optimal control theory, mathematical finance, and geometry) but are also of interest in other fields such as mechanical engineering, robotics, and neurophysiology. A second focus of the project concerns free boundary problems, which surface in physics and engineering in situations where a conserved quantity or relation changes discontinuously across some value of the variables under consideration. The free boundary appears, for instance, as the interface between a fluid and the air, or between water and ice.  One of the proposed projects aims at studying regularity properties of the free boundary in burnt-unburnt mixtures. The results of this investigation will lead to a better understanding of the models, to the improvement of simulation methods, and ultimately to a precise description of how flames propagate in nonhomogeneous media.  As mentioned earlier, several parts of this project find their motivation in the applied sciences. On the other hand, their solutions involve an interplay of ideas from different areas of analysis and geometry. It is conceivable that all these different fields will benefit from this synergy. The principal investigator is committed to the training of future generations of mathematicians and to increasing the representation of women in the scientific community via the organization of a variety of educational and mentoring activities for untenured faculty and graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students."
