Fisher<br/><br/>The main thrust of the proposed research is to introduce<br/>and develop new analytic techniques in group theory and<br/>the study of group actions.  Major projects include:<br/>(a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of<br/>coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work<br/>with Eskin and Whyte)<br/>(b) developing harmonic map techniques in rigidity<br/>theory, particularly in the context of infinite<br/>dimensional target spaces and<br/>(c) developing a normal form theory for group actions<br/>based on new generalizations and variants of hard<br/>implicit function theorems.<br/><br/>All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of<br/>rigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. The grant<br/>will also support summer schools devoted to new<br/>developments in rigidity theory. The field is broad and<br/>not entirely well defined, new developments frequently<br/>involve ideas from other areas of mathematics. These<br/>summer schools will provide students and young<br/>scientists the opportunity to learn about new<br/>developments quickly and to build the professional<br/>networks required to remain abreast of future new<br/>developments.<br/><br/>In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is<br/>often played by the symmetries of the object --<br/>particularly when the object has many symmetries. The PI<br/>investigates ways of characterizing, describing and<br/>studying spaces with many symmetries in various<br/>dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These<br/>questions are interdisciplinary in nature and often<br/>require learning, adapting and applying ideas and<br/>techniques from many areas of mathematics. The PI's work<br/>has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from<br/>celestial mechanics (KAM theory and stability of the<br/>solar system) to theoretical computer science (expander<br/>graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding<br/>problems). Many proposed projects involve applying<br/>analytic ideas and techniques to problems traditionally<br/>studied by dynamical, geometric or topological methods.<br/>"

In the first project, the principle investigator will continue his work on spectral and scattering theory for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and complex manifolds, studying properties of scattering resonances and their relationship to underlying geometric invariants. In the second project, he will work toward understanding the asymptotic behavior of heat kernels and singularities of the wave trace for two-step nilpotent Lie groups. Nonlinear dispersive equations with singular initial data may  be viewed, via the inverse scattering method, as linearized flows for the  scattering data of a very singular potential. We hope to extend the inverse  scattering picture for the KdV and mKdV equations to such singular data and obtain greater insight into these dynamical systems--by constructing the flow on Hilbert spaces of initial data which are singular but very natural from a dynamical point of view.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations provide underlying mathematical models for such diverse physical phenomena as wave propagation and heat flow.  An equally important part of any physical model is the geometry of the system it describes: for example, differently-shaped musical instruments produce sound waves with different frequencies, even though in all cases the production and propagation of waves is governed by the same differential equation. The first two projects above study the interaction between solutions of a certain partial differential equation and the geometry of the domain where the solutions are defined, and seek to relate quantifiable properties of the solutions to quantifiable properties of the underlying geometry. These projects are part of a larger effort in the mathematical community to understand ""inverse problems"" in which the geometry of a physical system is reconstructed from measurable data which are the solutions of a partial differential equation: seismology and medical imaging are among the areas of applied mathematics where such inverse problems occur. The third project is a contribution to the study of a class of equations arising in physics which describe the propagation of nonlinear waves by extending powerful solution methods to a richer set of data.<br/><br/>"

One problem involves completing the classification problem for proper affine actions, a basic problem in geometry whose history stretches back to the classification of Euclidean crystallographic groups in the early 20th century. In the last 25 years, the classification in 3 dimensions has been reduced to a problem in 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Another side of this general problem stems from the observation that deformation spaces of geometric structures are themselves locally modeled on representation spaces of fundamental groups. This naturally leads to dynamical questions on actions of mapping class groups. Moduli spaces of surface group representations  support invariant Poisson structures, as well as finer structures depending on a conformal structure. The dependence of these as the Riemann surface varies over Teichmueller space is crucial to understanding dynamics of surface group representations.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the relation between topology and geometry. While topology concerns the loose qualitative organization of patterns of points, geometry concerns quantitative measurements such as distance, angle and area. These two viewpoints are compared through symmetries, leading to algebraic calculations involving groups. The Experimental Geometry Lab has been a center for the PI and his students and collaborators (at all levels) to develop tools for these calculations and visualization. Many of the above projects have an experimental component and the PI will continue to work with students (from high school to postdocs) to develop user-friendly software to assist in their investigation and dissemination.<br/>"

Results of this type are useful to algebraic geometers working on the interplay between L2-cohomology and intersection cohomology.<br/><br/><br/>Many physical phenomena are modeled by systems of differential equations and one would like to understand the space of solutions to these equations.

This result led to the advancement of quantum field theory and the development of string theory in physics.

In his solution to Calabi's conjecture, Yau proved the<br/>existence of a Kahler-Einstein metric on compact Kahler manifolds<br/>with vanishing or negative first Chern class. An alternative<br/>proof of Calabi's conjecture is given by Cao using the<br/>Kahler-Ricci flow. However, most projective algebraic varieties<br/>do not have definite or trivial first Chern classes.  Recently<br/>Perelman has made major breakthrough in Hamilton's program as an<br/>approach to the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization<br/>conjecture. The principal investigator proposes to study the<br/>canonical metrics on the canonical models of projective varieties<br/>of positive Kodaira dimension by applying the Kahler-Ricci<br/>flow. Such canonical metrics are constructed by the deformation<br/>of the Kaher-Ricci flow on minimal projective surfaces of<br/>positive Kodaira dimension. These generalized Kahler-Einstein<br/>metrics can be considered as an analytic version of the abundance<br/>conjecture in algebraic geometry and will also lead to new<br/>advances in the understanding and application of the Ricci<br/>flow. In Donaldson's far reaching program, the geometry of the<br/>infinite dimensional symmetric space of Kahler metrics in a fixed<br/>class is related to the existence and uniqueness of constant<br/>scalar curvature Kahler metrics. The principal investigator also<br/>intends to study the uniform approximation problem of the<br/>Monge-Ampere geodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by<br/>those in the finite dimensional Bergman spaces on toric<br/>varieties.

The<br/>principal investigator will also apply the moment map point of<br/>view and study various geometric flows arising from Kahler<br/>geometry as well as symplectic geometry proposed by<br/>Donaldson. The first is the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of<br/>functional related to the Mabuchi energy. The second is a moment<br/>map flow in a hyperkahler four manifold.

This role has only been amplified in the last few decades since spaces with non-negative or positive curvature arise naturally in quite general contexts, including limit processes.  In this generality, positively curved spaces  (up to scaling) play exactly the same role as unit spheres do to smooth Riemannian manifolds. Our understanding of low dimensional non-negatively curved spaces also played a pivotal role in the recent solution of the famous Poincare and geometrization conjectures. In higher dimensions relatively little is known in general about manifolds or spaces with non-negative or positive curvature. Also only a few constructions and a modest number of examples are known. Motivated by the fact that all known examples come from group constructions and have fairly large groups of symmetries, one of the primary aims of this proposal is to expand our understanding of manifolds with positive or non-negative curvature by describing or possibly even classifying those with large symmetry groups. This program which combines geometry, topology and representation theory has already gained considerable momentum, and has resulted in several classification results as well as in the construction of many new manifolds with non-negative curvature, and new promising candidates for positive curvature.<br/><br/><br/>The sphere, the Euclidean space, and the hyperbolic space are exactly the (simply connected) spaces characterized by having constant curvature and also by having maximal symmetry group. Spaces being more curved than these spaces are characterized geometrically by the property that geodesic triangles (triangles with shortest side lengths) are ""fatter"" than in the constant curvature space. For example a space has non-negative curvature if geodesic triangles in the space are ""fatter"" than in the Euclidean plane (where the sum of angles is 180 degrees). Such spaces play a fundamental role in geometry and form an extension of classical Riemannian geometry, which deals with smooth and regular spaces of this type. The ones of positive, non-negative curvature, or even ""almost non- negative"" curvature play a particular role and their investigations are essential to all of them. As in many part of physics our purpose in this proposal is to analyze and ultimately describe positively curved spaces and non-negatively curved spaces where large groups of symmetries are present (as is the case for the classical constant curvature model spaces above). These investigations will also provide ""models"" for analyzing ""almost non-positively curved spaces"" and thereby give new insights to the structure of all spaces with a lower curvature bound and possibly yield general long sought after restrictions on manifolds with non-negative curvature via limit processes.<br/><br/><br/>"

The project consists of three themes. The first theme is to study metric structures introduced by the PI and Taylor, on Teichmuller space and quasifuchsian space. These structures generalize the classical Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space to quasifuchsian space. In recent related work, McMullen has defined a Weil-Petterson type metric on the moduli of certain dynamical systems, thereby adding another entry to the Sullivan dictionary between hyperbolic geometry and the dynamics of rational maps. The second theme is to study measures introduced by the PI and Dumas, arising from considering  the intersection of a ``random geodesic'' with a geodesic laminations on a hyperbolic surface. The measures give the distribution of lengths of geodesic arcs in the complement of the geodesic lamination and are explicitly given by the image of the volume measure on the unit tangent bundle of the surface under a certain measurable real map. These measures closely resemble the Sato-Tate measures studied in number theory and the theory of L-functions which arise by taking the image of Haar volume measure under a real representation. The third theme is to study the torsion of a quasifuchsian manifold. This invariant is the imaginary part of the complex length of the Patterson-Sullivan measure and is a natural invariant to measure  the average ``twistedness''  of a quasifuchsian group and an be thought of as a Chern-Simons invariant for quasifuchsian manifolds.  In particular, the PI would like to describe how the torsion changes under bending deformations.  <br/><br/><br/>This project lies at the intersection of hyperbolic geometry, dynamics  and number theory. In each of these areas, natural spaces arise, called Moduli spaces, which describe the possible deformations of a given object. In the case where the object is a hyperbolic surface, the space we consider is the  space of all hyperbolic geometries on the surface, called Teichmuller space. We propose to study these Moduli spaces by considering geometric invariants arising from geodesic currents on the objects. These geodesic currents are uniformly random paths on the objects. In the case of the hyperbolic surface we consider the Liouville geodesic current associated with a given surface. By measuring the variation of the length of the Liouville geodesic current as we move around in Teichmuller space, we obtain important geometric information about  the surface. By studying these invariants, we hope to elucidate our understanding of the three areas and the connections between them.<br/>"

As a step in the regularity theory, and also as an interesting variational problem in its own right, it is also proposed to develop an independent theory for the corresponding ""linear"" variational problem; i.e. to study the regularity properties and the branching behavior of co-dimension 1 multiple valued critical points of the Dirichlet's integral.<br/><br/>The research proposed here is directed towards reaching in two specific previously unexplored contexts a goal that is common to a broader class of problems; namely, understanding the critical points of functionals occurring in various mathematical and physical problems. One often faces the problem of finding an extremum of a mathematical or physical quantity such as volume or some energy. In order to find an extremum, one has to work in a sufficiently large space of competitors which often need to be allowed to carry certain undesirable properties (singularities), with the expectation that a critical point will have nicer behavior than a typical competitor in the class. It is indeed often the case that a critical point found this way has more regularity, but it is also typical that it carries some small set of essential singularities. In order to fully understand the nature of the critical point, it is therefore necessary to study its singularities as well as its behavior near the singularities.<br/><br/>"

In particular, the homological mirror symmetry conjecture of Kontsevich expresses this physical phenomenon as an equivalence of brane categories.  One such category is the Fukaya category, constructed from Lagrangian submanifolds. A central focus of this project will be the relationship, found recently by the Principal Investigator with D. Nadler, between the Fukaya category of the cotangent bundle of a manifold and constructible sheaves on the base. This construction will be used:  1) to study mirror symmetry for the cotangent bundle; 2) to characterize perverse sheaves in terms of their corresponding Fukaya objects; and 3) to construct Hecke eigensheaves in the geometric Langlands program, following the proposal of Kapustin-Witten to look at torus fibers of the Hitchin fibration.  Another aspect of the proposal focusses on constructing the mirror map of moduli purely from techniques of homological mirror symmetry, thereby bridging Kontsevich's point of view with the historical approach to mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>Over the past few decades, mathematics and theoretical physics have become linked in a profound way.  The field of string theory best illustrates this interdependence.  Within string theory, mirror symmetry is the prime example of how one phenomenon in physics can link seemingly disparate fields of mathematics. This proposal will broaden the mathematical scope of mirror symmetry through lines of research that both create, and capitalize on, recent advances. In particular, connections between topology, representation theory, and the geometric Langlands program have emerged, as have new methods for constructing examples of mirror symmetry from homological algebra. This research could thus lead to progress in several longstanding goals: understanding mirror symmetry in its most general setting, and constructing eigensheaves for Hecke operations in the geometric Langlands program.<br/><br/><br/>"

The goals of the complex-analytic part of the project are the following: 1) derivation of the higher genus analog of Kronecker's second limit formula; 2) study of a new Kaehler metric on moduli spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces (so-called Takhtajan-Zograf metric), and Chern forms on moduli spaces of parabolic vector bundles; 3) application of the Weil-Petersson geometry of the universal Teichmueller space for the study of the univalent functions in the unit disk; 4) new relation between solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem and the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory; 5) development of non-perturbative methods in geometric approach to quantum Liouville theory. This will result in major advances in the areas of mathematical physics related to the complex geometry of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and vector bundles, will give a remarkable product formula for Riemann theta-function in higher genus, will provide a new understanding of the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem, and will introduce new infinite-dimensional methods in the theory of the univalent functions.<br/><br/>The immediate and long term goals of the algebraic side are the following: <br/>1) unification of classical theory of abelian differentials on Riemann surfaces with the adelic approach of C.~Chevalley and A.~Weil --- formulation of  ``differential and integral calculus'' on algebraic curves over algebraically closed ground field, to be used for constructing quantum field theories on algebraic curves and for reciprocity laws; 2) development of  ``algebraic harmonic analysis'' on adeles when the corresponding residue class field is not a finite field. This will result in a dramatic advance of our understanding of ``calculus'' on algebraic curves with applications that will possibly include fields of algebraic numbers.<br/><br/>The last thirty years have been characterized by remarkable interaction between mathematics and physics, which let to dramatic discoveries in various mathematics disciplines, bringing together the areas that were thought to be apart. In many cases application of methods of quantum fields and strings has been very successful, once again justifying Riemann's old idea of ``probing'' mathematical objects with physical theories and translating the physical ``output'' back into the realm of mathematics. When probing mathematical objects by quantum field theory, the mathematical output is encoded in partition function and correlation functions of quantum fields, defined by Feynman path integral, usually given in terms of perturbation expansion, and expressed through the critical value of the classical action and so-called ``quantum corrections''. Symmetries of the theory manifest themselves in Ward identities --- fundamental relations between partition function and correlation functions, which in many cases produce new and unexpected mathematical results. Proper understanding and exploitation of these symmetries is in the heart of today's applications of quantum physics to different mathematical disciplines. The realization of the main goals of the proposal will significantly contribute to the fundamental interface between mathematics and physics. This applies to the complex-analytic part as well as to the algebraic part; the fundamental properties of the latter are discrete, to study them at a microscopic scale using quantum theory. In particular, many classical mathematical results about fields of algebraic functions and algebraic numbers, known as reciprocity laws, can be interpreted as conservation laws (like conservation of energy) in quantum theory. The main goal of the algebraic part of the project is to develop this analogy further by formulating an approach based on the algebraic version of a Green's function, which is a fundamental object of classical analysis and mathematical physics, and is extensively used in quantum field theory.<br/><br/><br/>"

In recent work the PI has shown that ideas from hyperbolic and computational geometry could help resolve a question of classical analysis: how to efficiently compute conformal maps onto planar domains.  This work will be extended to new settings, and will be used to study problems arising in computational geometry, e.g., efficient generation of meshes with desirable properties. The PI will investigate the possible application of the carpenter's rule problem from computational geometry to an analysis problem about deforming chord-arc curves. He will also continue his work on the distortion properties of quasiconformal mappings and on the conformal welding problem.<br/><br/><br/>The PI, Christopher Bishop, will continue his investigations into the theory and computation of conformal and quasiconformal maps. Conformal maps send one region to another so that angles (but not necessarily distances) are preserved. Quasiconformal maps may distort angles, but only by a limited amount. One of the oldest and most famous examples is the Mercator projection which maps the spherical Earth to flat piece of paper. This can't be done without some sort of distortion, and for navigation it is more convenient to have angles preserved than distances (so looking at a chart you know the correct direction to head, if not the exact distance to be covered). Conformal maps also appear in many applications where one wants to transfer a problem from a domain with complicated geometry to a simpler one (such as a disk) where it is easier to solve. Examples come from aerodynamics, fluid flow, vibrating membranes, heat flow, electrostatics and many other problems. Conformal maps also play a fundamental role within pure mathematics in areas such as dynamics, complex analysis, probability and geometry. Because of their importance, there are numerous techniques for computing conformal maps numerically, but different methods work best in different situations and often a method fails for sufficiently complicated regions. The PI has developed an algorithm that is guaranteed to work for a large class of regions, and is able to estimate the time needed to achieve a given accuracy.  The algorithm is based on new connections between geometric concepts from computer science and non-Euclidean geometry arising in pure mathematics. Under the current proposal the PI will seek to turn this theoretical algorithm into a practical method, investigate generalizations more complicated regions and to higher dimensions, and apply the method to problems arising from computer science.<br/>"

Penrose proposed a conjecture which relates the total mass of a spacetime to the area of its event horizons (boundary of black holes) via the inequality: total mass squared is greater than or equal to the total area of the event horizons divided by 16 pi.  The primary goal of this research is to prove the full Penrose Inequality, and to use the methods developed to study several related problems concerning mass in General Relativity. It is best to view this conjecture as an inequality for an arbitrary spacelike slice of a spacetime, and it has been confirmed (by Huisken and Ilmanen for one black hole, and by Bray for finitely many black holes) in the case that the slice has zero second fundamental form (the time symmetric case).  For the first time the conjecture for a general slice appears to be within reach in light of a recent discovery by H. Bray and the author, which reduces the problem to solving a canonical system of partial differential equations.  Unexpectedly, this new method has revealed a significant connection between the Penrose Inequality, the Hoop Conjecture, and the Liu-Yau quasilocal mass.  The author intends to further investigate and develop these connections, with the aim of obtaining a definitive necessary and sufficient condition for black hole formation, as well as a modified version of the Liu-Yau mass which overcomes some of its inherent difficulties.<br/><br/>  The Penrose Inequality was originally put forth by Penrose to study the most important open question in classical General Relativity today, namely the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.  This conjecture asserts that whenever singularities occur in the evolution of spacetime (which is expected to be a generic phenomenon) they must always be hidden from the outside world by an event horizon, that is, they must always lie inside a black hole.  According to Penrose's heuristic derivation, the Penrose Inequality is essentially a necessary condition for cosmic censorship to hold. Thus if the Penrose Inequality were to be confirmed it would add significantly to the general belief in the validity of cosmic censorship, which in turn is fundamental for determining how well General Relativity is behaved as a physical theory.  Furthermore, a correction to the Liu-Yau quasilocal mass would possibly lead to the first fully meaningful expression of local energy density for the gravitational field.  This in turn should lead to new advances in the study of the Cauchy problem for the Einstein Equations, as well as in the study of black hole formation (the Hoop Conjecture). Lastly, it is a general theme in General Relativity that theorems involving initial data sets for the Einstein Equations (such as the Penrose Inequality and Positive Mass Theorem) are often proved first in the easier time symmetric case, while the general case is then some how reduced back to time symmetry.  It is expected that the methods developed for the full Penrose Inequality will provide a new powerful tool for making such a reduction to time symmetry, and will therefore have numerous applications to a wide range of problems in General Relativity.<br/>"

The proposal has several interrelated parts. The first concerns the groups of algebraic cycles and cocycles on a projective variety X. The aim is to relate these groups to  the global structure of   X.  The investigator has, with others, established  a theory of homology type for algebraic varieties based on the homotopy groups of cycles spaces. This theory will be used to study concrete questions about algebraic spaces.  Implications for real algebraic geometry will be explored. Striking connections to universal constructions in topology which emerged in prior research will also be investigated.  The second part of the proposal concerns cycles which bound holomorphic chains in projective  manifolds. In particular, characterizations in terms of projective linking numbers  and quasi-plurisubharmonic functions will be sought. This will  entail a deep analysis of the structure of projective hulls, a concept analogous to polynomial hulls, which has been introduced by the investigator and is ofindependent interest. Projective hulls are related to approximation theory, pluripotential theory, and the spectrum of  Banach graded algebras.   The third topic, a major part of the proposal, concerns the broad development of a pluripotential theory in calibrated and other geometries. The notions of plurisubharmonic function, pseudo-convex domain, capacity, and solutions to the Dirichlet problem for generalized Monge-Amp\`ere-type equations will be studied in a very general setting.  This project, already underway, should have an  impact in calibrated geometry, which in turn plays an important role in M-theory in modern physics.  There should also be applications to symplectic geometry and to  p-convexity in riemannian geometry. The forth  part of the proposal concerns sparks and spark complexes. These objects mediate betweeen cycles and smooth data, and give a concrete presentation of differential characters and their generalizations. In the complex category this involves an analytic study of Deligne cohomology and relates to arithmetic Chow groups. It yields invariants for bundles and foliations, and retrieves the classical Abel-Jacobi mappings.  This project will also be concerned with  student development, including an undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering  mathematical independence and developing interactive environments.<br/> <br/><br/>                          Part II<br/><br/>  A concept of central importance in geometry is that of a ``cycle''.  In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the simultaneous solution of a system of polynomial equations. In differential geometry they arise in many ways: as the large scale solutions of certain differential equations, and as the level sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.   Curves and surfaces in space are simple examples.  Cycles with  a particular geometry also play a fundamental role in modern physical theories<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with the study of cycles across this broad spectrum. In the algebraic setting, cycles have been related to fundamental large-scale geometry of their surrounding  space. This discovery has revealed surprizing and important relationships between spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental constructions in algebraic topology and has led to new insights in both fields.  This work will be continued.<br/><br/>Another area of investigation concerns cycles which form the boundary of subsets with special geometric structure.  They represent non-linear versions of classical boundary value problems in analysis. Such questions arise in many contexts.  The proposer has formulated conjectures relating important classes of such cycles to questions in approximation theory and Banach algebras. Successful resolution will establish a series of new results in complex geometry and should lead to significant new insights in several other fields of mathematics.<br/><br/>A third part of the proposal aims at extending classical pluripotential theory to very general geometric settings. These include calibrated geometries, symplectic  and Lagrangian geometries, and much more.An uncanny amount of the classical theory has already been shown to hold in this general context. Solutions to the Dirichlet problem for associated Monge-Ampere type equations will be sought in this setting. The study is, in a certain strict sense, dual to the study of the special cycles appearing in these geometries.  It should apply to Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, and associative and  Cayley cycles in G(2)  and Spin(7) spaces.  These latter subjects relate to gauge field theory and gravity in Physics<br/><br/>A forth domain of investigation concerns  a mathematical apparatus developed by the proposer and R. Harvey to detect subtle relationships between cycles and the global  structure of the space they live in.  This apparatus encompasses some of the most effective tools historically developed for this  purpose, and it is much more general. Further development of this theory  and its applications will be pursued.   <br/> <br/>This project will also be concerned with graduate student development.<br/>Students will be part of the research team.  There will also be an undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering mathematical independence and developing interactive environments.<br/><br/>"

Recently, Marcus Khuri and the PI have made important progress on the Penrose Conjecture for asymptotically-flat space-like slices of spacetimes by reducing the conjecture to interesting existence questions for certain naturally motivated systems of p.d.e.'s.  One of these existence questions is similar to the one solved by Huisken-Ilmanen to prove the existence of the inverse mean curvature flow with jumps, but for a system of two equations instead of one equation.  The physical interpretation of the Penrose Conjecture is the natural idea that the total mass of a spacetime with nonnegative energy density should be at least the mass contributed by the black holes in the spacetime.  In 1973, Roger Penrose was able to turn the above statement into a precise geometric conjecture about the Cauchy data of an asymptotically flat space-like slice (itself a Riemannian 3-manifold) of a spacetime.  The time-symmetric case, known as the Riemannian Penrose Conjecture, was proved by the PI in 1999, and by Huisken-Ilmanen in 1997 for a single black hole.  In this case, the energy density of the spacetime equals the scalar curvature of the slice, the total mass is a parameter describing the rate at which the Riemannian manifold is becoming flat at infinity, and apparent horizons of black holes are area-outerminimizing minimal surfaces.  The Riemannian Penrose Inequality is the statement that the total mass is greater than or equal to the square root of the surface area of the apparent horizons of the black holes divided by 16 pi.  When we drop the assumption that the Riemannian manifold is time-symmetric in the spacetime and allow the second fundamental form of the slice to be anything, a generalization of this statement is known simply as the Penrose Conjecture.  The PI also studies negative point mass singularities in General Relativity and questions relating to quasi-local mass.<br/><br/>As acclaimed a theory as General Relativity is, fundamental aspects of the theory are still not understood.  For example, given the state of the universe at one instant of (coordinate) time, it is not currently known if the relevant equations, including the Einstein equation, can be solved forward in time other than for a very short period.  Yet the universe, as we observe daily, exists without interruption.  Hence, understanding the existence theory of the Cauchy Problem in General Relativity, as this problem is called, is a major question.  If General Relativity does not has a physical existence theory, this will be a major hint as to how the theory needs to be modified.  If General Relativity does have an existence theory corresponding to the physical universe, then this will be one more piece of evidence supporting the theory.  One thing that is clear is that black holes and singularities play an important role in this question.  In any case, understanding fundamental theoretical questions about General Relativity will not only deepen our understanding of the theory, but also help current and future researchers develop the next generation of physical theories.<br/><br/>"

Over the years numerous applications to---or connections with---other fields of mathematics, science, and engineering have been discovered, including partial differential equations, algebraic geometry, statistics, number theory, Minkowski and Finsler geometry, stereology, information theory. The goal of this proposal is the development of extensions and duals of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory. A special focus is the development of affine isoperimetric inequalities. There have been numerous applications of affine inequalities in PDEs, Banach space geometry, geometric tomography, and even robot vision. Another special focus will be the development of the analytic counterparts of affine isoperimetric inequalities. New methods developed by the PIs will be used to attempt to make progress on a number of long-conjectured affine isoperimetric inequalities. Another main focus of the proposal concerns a prescribed curvature problem, known as the Lp Minkowski problem, that arises naturally within the extended Brunn-Minkowski theory. Work of the PIs indicates that there are interesting potential connections between information theory and convex geometric analysis. These connections will be exploited with the aim of establishing new geometric results inspired by their information theory counterparts.<br/><br/>The classical Brunn-Minkowski theory has provided powerful tools needed to solve a variety of basic inverse problems where the only ""data"" available involves information regarding the projections of convex bodies onto lower-dimensional subspaces (such as lines and planes). However, the tools of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory have been of little value in dealing with the dual of these questions, where ""projections onto subspaces"" are replaced by ""intersections with subspaces"".  The PIs are continuing efforts to develop a dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. This dual theory has already led to the solution of a longstanding problem where the known information involved the intersections of the unknown bodies with planes.  Such ""inverse problems"" are basic in not only mathematics but also science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>"

Some of the questions that Tolman and her collaborators plan to study are closely related to  important problems in other fields;  they hope that these projects will not only give  insight into symplectic manifolds but also shed new light on the original problems. For example, R. Goldin and  Tolman  are  working on extending  the results of Schubert calculus to  more general symplectic manifolds. L. Godinho and  Tolman are attempting to  prove the symplectic analog of the Petrie conjecture. Other questions that Tolman is working on  are designed to explore the ""geography"" of  symplectic manifolds with group actions by determining whether such spaces are always as well behaved as the natural examples which we usually consider. For example, Tolman is considering when symplectic actions are Hamiltonian, when such manifolds possess the hard Lefshetz property, and what restrictions their graphs must obey.  She and Karshon are also classifying (n-1)-dimensional Hamiltonian torus actions on 2n-dimensional symplectic manifolds; this will provide a new source of examples. Many important manifolds arise most naturally as symplectic quotients. While  this fact has been used extremely successfully to compute their rational cohomology rings, many of the theorems do not hold over the integers. Therefore, T. Holm and Tolman are studying how to compute the integral cohomology ring of such quotients. Generalizations of symplectic forms which allow some degeneration, such as near symplectic forms and folded symplectic forms, have recently played an important role in the study of four-manifolds. Tolman plans to work on understanding the role  group actions in these geometries. Finally, Y. Lin and Tolman  are using  generalized Kaehler reduction to construct new examples of  Bihermitian structures, which play an important role in string theory.<br/><br/><br/>In classical physics, symmetries of a physical system give rise to conserved quantities.For example, the total angular momentum of the solar system is constant. From a mathematical perspective, studying these physical systems corresponds to studying Hamiltonian group actions on a special type of symplectic manifold - a cotangent bundle. The underlying goal of the proposed research is to gain a better understanding of what types of symplectic manifolds admit group actions, and how to calculate their invariants.<br/>Working with her collaborators, Tolman plans to attack this question on a number of fronts. She hopes that this will lead to a greater understanding of an area of increasing importance, both within mathematics and for physics."

The principal aim of the project is to gain a deeper understanding of the large scale geometry of various classes of metric spaces through the study of higher-dimensional isoperimetric inequalities. The project's first and main part focuses on simply connected geodesic metric spaces of non-positive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov, called Hadamard spaces. In this setting, a particular goal is to establish connections between the behavior of higher-dimensional isoperimetric functions (and other filling invariants) and various notions of rank. If successful, the research will result in an answer to Gromov's conjecture on linear isoperimetric inequalities which asserts Euclidean behavior in the dimensions below and linear behavior in the dimensions above the Euclidean rank in a proper cocompact Hadamard space. The proposed approach relies on methods from geometric measure theory and analysis on metric spaces, in particular on the notion of metric currents, the theory of which has recently been developed by Ambrosio and Kirchheim. An important second part of the project will thus be to further develop the theory of metric currents, which provides a suitable notion of surfaces in a metric space and also gives powerful tools in the study of many other problems in geometric analysis, e.g. such involving energy minimization. Isoperimetric inequalities also play a fundamental role in geometric group theory. For finitely presented groups one-dimensional isoperimetric functions measure the complexity of the word problem and have been extensively studied over the past 15 years. The study of higher-dimensional isoperimetric functions, on the other hand, has only recently become a very active field of research. A last part of the project investigates filling problems in the context of nilpotent Lie groups.<br/><br/>The study of isoperimetric problems has a long history. Not only has it inspired many mathematicians, but it has also led to many new theories in mathematics. In the most classical setting-known already to the Ancient Greeks-the isoperimetric inequality asserts that a closed curve in the plane encloses an area no larger than that of a disc of the same circumference. Higher-dimensional analogues are concerned with the question of how well a k-dimensional closed surface can be filled with a (k+1)-dimensional surface. Filling problems appear in many different fields of mathematics, including analysis, geometry, probability theory and group theory. The aim of the present project is to study the effects that curvature has on the isoperimetric filling problem. The investigation will in particular lead to a deeper understanding of the geometry of non-positively curved singular spaces. Such arise for example in the mathematical study of billiard trajectories. The project proposes to use methods from the field of geometric measure theory, dealing with the study of singular surfaces. This theory was to a large extent inspired by Plauteau's problem, which asks for the existence of a minimal surface (or a soap film) with prescribed boundary.

In particular, the researchers use geometric function theory in the form of the theory of quasiconformal mappings to probe analytic symmetries of hyperbolizable surfaces and $n$-manifolds. With equal emphasis, this proposal also details analytic questions in the theory of quasiconformal mappings. In particular the researchers tie together certain geometric invariants to the conjectured solution in dimensions three and above of the Teichmuller extremal problem. Another major theme in their work involves the interaction between dynamics and geometry as illuminated by Patterson-Sullivan theory. The researchers describe projects that study the generalization of the  Patterson-Sullivan theory of Kleinian groups to both the setting of convex co-compact subgroups of the modular group, and to the purely analytic setting of discrete quasiconformal groups.<br/><br/>The nexus of hyperbolic geometry, conformal analysis, and low-dimensional topology is a vast and fundamental area of study in mathematics. It dates back to the 19th century, when it was developed by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein, and Poincare.  These fields remain vital, as attested by the recent epochal results of G. Perelman on the Poincare and Geometrization  Conjectures. As mathematics is inherently interconnected, surprising and beautiful applications are often found at the interfaces of mathematical fields. Recently, hyperbolic geometry has found<br/>application in the study of discrete geometry and machine vision.   Further, in physics both hyperbolic geometry and conformal analysis  (especially in the guise of Teichmuller theory) have become a  standard tool in the exploration of theoretical physics and  cosmology. Wesleyan University has a strong dual identity as a research and teaching institution, and the proposers are strongly dedicated  to innovation in both research and education. A core objective of  the researchers is to use the broad and integrative relationship  between hyperbolic geometry and geometric analysis to increase  both the interest and strength of those advanced undergraduate <br/>and beginning graduate students enrolled in graduate analysis  and geometry courses at Wesleyan University.<br/>"

The first group of problems addressed concerns the so-called Conley conjecture and the almost existence theorem for periodic orbits. The general form of the Conley conjecture asserts the existence of infinitely many periodic points of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a symplectically aspherical, closed manifold. This conjecture has recently been established by Hingston and the PI.<br/>However, many aspects of the problem require further investigation. For instance, one can expect the conjecture to hold even when the manifold is not aspherical, but the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism has sufficiently many fixed points. The proposed research addresses this and some other aspects of the Conley conjecture. The almost existence theorem guarantees the existence of periodic orbits on almost all levels of a proper, autonomous Hamiltonian for a broad class of symplectic manifolds.  This theorem is closely related, on both conceptual and technical levels, to the Conley conjecture and the Weinstein conjecture. A project described in the proposal aims at complementing the almost existence theorem by showing that the set of energy values without periodic orbits is nowhere dense. The second part of the proposal focuses on symplectic topological properties of coisotropic submanifolds. These properties generalize the Lagrangian intersection property and the Maslov class rigidity and have important application in dynamics.  Moreover, a general picture is emerging, enabling one to treat such facts as non-existence of exact Lagrangian embeddings and the existence of closed characteristics on a contact type hypersurface as particular cases of one phenomenon. The main goal of the program started recently by the PI and outlined in the proposal is to further analyze and extend this picture.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of physical processes in which dissipative forces can be neglected. For example, planetary motion in celestial mechanics and some electro- or magneto-dynamical processes can be, and usually are, treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the classical subjects lying at the very core of modern theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems and symplectic geometry is the study of periodic orbits (i.e., cyclic motions). Periodic orbits are ubiquitous: a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems have periodic orbits and the number of distinct periodic orbits is infinite for a broad class of systems. The analysis of this phenomenon, building on the PI's recent work, is among the main objectives of the proposed research. The class of dynamical systems in question includes those describing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field and the proposed research has potential applications to physics and mathematical aspects of mechanics.<br/>"

In particular, to a multi-dimensional generalization of the Dedekind eta-function. We also consider a new regularization procedure for definition of the trace and the determinant of certain class of pseudo-differential operators on odd-dimensional manifolds. This procedure allows to avoid many anomalies coursed by usual zeta-function regularization. It also turns out to be the most adequate for description of non-linear sigma-models of superconductivity.

The definition of the new invariant is based on the study of determinants of non-self-adjoint differential operators.

One of the most important and extensively studied areas of geometry is the study of canonical metrics. Geometric variational problems and geometric flows have been two of the most fruitful approaches to the study of canonical metrics. It is important to understand the stability issue associated to variational problems. Stability issue is also important in the study of geometric flows. One of the goals here is to use the Dirac operator in the study of stability problems for Einstein metrics and positive scalar curvature and scalar flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds and shed light on the so called positive mass problem for Ricci flat manifolds. It will also develop local index theory technique in the study of heat kernel and Bergman kernel and their connection with canonical metrics. In particular, the investigator (with collaborators) would like to search for an analogue, for orbifolds, of Donaldson's theorem relating the existence of Kahler metrics with constant scalar curvature with algebro-geometric notions of stability. Another focus of the proposal is the study of Ricci flow on a class of noncompact manifolds, the ALE spaces, and explores the connection with the famous Positive Mass Theorem. Finally the investigator will study the significance and degeneration problems of geometric invariants such as eta invariant and analytic torsion. <br/><br/>Recent development shows the extraordinary power of the geometric flows such as the Ricci flow. Dirac operators and related geometric invariants, inspired by Physics and coming out of the Atiyah-Singer index theory, are playing significant and important role in diverse fields of mathematics and physics. They reveal much about the topological, geometric and analytic structures of the underlying space. This proposal aims for better understanding of the variational structure of important geometric functionals and geometric flows, the use of geometric invariants in studying moduli spaces of geometric structures and special metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. It also explores the connection with positive mass theorems. According to Einstein's general relativity, gravity is the manifestation of curvature of the space. Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces in nature and the dominating one in shaping our universe. The understanding of mass and momentum is of crucial importance in our ultimate understanding of the universe. Calabi-Yau manifolds and special metrics play essential role in physics. The proposed activities would have impact on all these directions. The proposal will also have educational impact as it involves graduate students and post-doctors. <br/><br/>"

Perelman has made great advances in applying Ricci flow to the topology of 3-manifolds. There remain open questions about using his ideas to completely classify closed 3-manifolds (i.e., establish Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture). These questions revolve around the theory of sufficiently collapsed 3-manifolds and their relationship to Alexandrov spaces of dimension at most 2. Sorting these issues out will give  a complete, detailed argument proving the Geometrization Conjecture. There should be an analogous theory of sufficiently collapsed 4-manifolds and the relation of these objects to Alexandrov spaces of dimension at most 3. Developing such a theory for 4-manifolds will be important in its own right, but may also be crucial in applying Ricci flow to prove topological results in dimension 4. The other area of study is mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau 3-folds in toric varieties.Here the idea is to establish mirror symmetry for these examples at the fairly delicate level of variations of Hodge structure and monodromy representations.<br/><br/>There have been exciting developments in the subject of topology in the last few years which this proposal will explore. These involve the interplay between topology and other, more geometric and analytic, areas of mathematics. Perelman's application of a heat-type flow equation and techniques from geometry to establish the Poincare Conjecture, the oldest and most fundamental of all topological questions, is a major watershed moment in the subject. This is one of the deepest and most beautiful applications of partial differential equations to a purely topological problem ever. There remain many questions of how to apply the same ideas to all 3-dimensional spaces, not just simplest, which is the 3-dimensional sphere. More speculatively, there is the question of how to extend these ideas to provide new insights into 4-dimensional spaces, about which we know little, except that the possibilities are much wider than in dimension 3. Another main theme in topology and geometry over the past few years is to make sense of the mirror symmetry. This principle is derived by non-rigorous physics arguments and is unlike anything normally seen in `classical mathematics.' It is some version of `quantum mathematics.' This notion has led to an incredibly rich flourishing of mathematics on the interface of topology and geometry as mathematicians attempt to understand special cases of this notion, to formulate this notion precisely, and to establish it mathematically.<br/>"

The first part of the project studies optimal ramified (i.e. branching) transportation, which was modeled after many branching structures in nature such as trees, river channel networks etc. A central concept there is the notion of optimal transport path, which mathematically plays the role of a ""geodesic"" between two probability measures. Graphically, it has a ""tree-shaped"" branching structure similar to fractals. Some of the problems to be addressed within the project are the following: (1) Optimal ramified transportation in metric measure spaces; (2) Optimal ramified transportation of higher dimensional geometric objects (3) Flow of surfaces driven by curvature and transportation (including both ramified type transportation and Monge-Kantorovich type transportation), which are modeled after the growth of tree leaves, flowers and mud-cracking; (4) Dimensional distance between measures and sets.  The second part of the project studies properties of ""minimal surfaces"" lived in singular varieties, using geometric measure theory. The PI proved that the intersection homology theory of MacPherson and Gorsky on singular varieties can be reformulated in terms of rectifiable currents, and also studied existence as well as partial regularities of minimizers under suitable modified masses within each intersection homology group. The PI aims at further investigations of these minimizers using analytic tools developed in geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>One of the main purposes of mathematics is to explore the beauty and mechanisms of many naturally generated shapes such as soap films, trees, leaves, and mud cracking. Many times, optimization process plays a very important role in the formation of these shapes. For instance, soap films come from minimizing surface area, while trees adopt branching transport systems to minimize transportation cost. This project aims at studying geometric shapes whose formation is driven by some optimization process. The first part of this project studies ""tree-type"" branching systems, which are commonly found in living and non-living systems such as trees, railways, river channel networks, lightning, the circulatory system, and neural networks. Nature has selected these branching transport systems partially because they are comparably cost efficient. As a result, to study mechanisms behind the formation of these branching systems, one may simply start with the study of optimal transport systems. In the last few years, the PI and many others have developed geometric variational methods for studying optimal ramified transportation, and also found its application in modeling the formation of tree leaves. In this project, the principal investigator is interested in developing the existing theory in a more general setting, and then applies it to transport specific geometric objects. Also, by considering geometric flow of surfaces driven by curvature and transportation, one may use them to model the formation of leaves, flowers, and some other fractal type objects.  On the other hand, soap films are physical model for minimal surfaces, which play an important role as a tool in the study of topology, geometry and physics. The second part of the project aims at studying general properties of ""soap films"" lived in singular varieties, which are very nice but usually contains some singularities, within their intersection homology groups. We will mainly use geometric measure theory as our analytic tools.<br/><br/>"

This should lead to topological invariants and TQFT's by using gauge theoretic moduli spaces to represent topological morphisms ( e.g. 3-cobordisms or tangles) as Lagrangian correspondences.<br/><br/>The project belongs into the general realm of interaction between symplectic geometry and low dimensional topology. The construction of topological invariants via a symplectic category has been a guiding vision in this field although the geometric composition of Lagrangian correspondences is only partially defined. This project aims to realize this vision, based on a full algebraic definition of compositions. Moreover, a proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture would be an important step towards understanding the relations between different invariants of 3-manifolds. More generally, this project aims to further the understanding and exposition of the analytic foundations of gauge theory, pseudoholomorphic curves, and moduli spaces of nonlinear PDE's in general. <br/>"

The second problem that this proposal will tackle is the existence of symmetric differentials on projective manifolds and its impact on hyperbolicity properties. The principal investigator showed previously that there are symmetric differentials on deformations of smooth hypersurfaces in projective 3-space.

The P.I. has developed local deformation and asymptotic gluing techniques that have proven fruitful, both for understanding the asymptotic structure of solutions of the constraints, and for performing localized gluing constructions on solutions to the constraints.  For example, joint work of the P.I. with R. Schoen showed that solutions to the vacuum constraints which have exactly Kerr asymptotics are dense in the space of asymptotically flat solutions.  Part of the project involves studying the extension of the asymptotic results to the asymptotically hyperbolic setting, which would have application to the Positive Mass Theorem in this case (following recent work of Andersson-Cai-Galloway).  Results on both asymptotics and localized gluing constructions will be extended to the case of gravity coupled with matter fields.  Related aspects of the project include: the study of small-data solutions of the constraints (relating to, for example, the Penrose compactification); local deformation properties of the constraints in conjunction with quasi-local mass minimizers, in the sense of Bartnik; the existence of horizons and isoperimetric profiles in asymptotically flat spaces; some problems in Lorentzian comparison geometry.  <br/><br/>A more thorough understanding of the space of solutions of the Einstein constraint equations would lead naturally to a better understanding of the space of solutions to Einstein's field equations, which are commonly used to model the large-scale structure of the universe.  To understand the dynamics of gravitational systems, one might construct initial data with desired properties, like multiple horizons, or specified asymptotic structure, and then use such data for numerical modeling of the evolution into the resulting space-times.  Natural physical questions often become interesting geometric and analytical problems involving the relevant partial differential equations and geometric quantities.

Harmonic maps are important as analytical objects which can be used to represent geometric, topological and algebraic objects associated to a space and have numerous actual and potential applications in geometry, topology, and algebra, as well as other fields in mathematics.  In a joint work with G. Daskalopoulos, we investigate existence and regularity properties of harmonic maps from polyhedral domains. The main applications are in geometric superrigidity, geometric group theory, character varieties and Hodge theory. In a project with S. Yamada, we study minimal surfaces with prescribed singularity complimenting the existing theory in geometric measure theory. This work includes the singular version of the classical Plateau problem as well as the equivariant minimal surface problem. <br/><br/>The primary object of study in the proposed projects is a harmonic map.  A map is a geometric representation of one space into another. There is a natural notion of energy of a map which measures the total stretch.   A harmonic map achieves equilibrium position with respect to this energy.  For example, a configuration of a rubber sheet spread out over a bumpy surface of a rock can be understood as a map.  The energy is the total tension of the rubber and the configuration of least tension is a harmonic map.   A rubber sheet, without any outside forces acting on it, will naturally arrange itself into a position given by a harmonic map. Thus, a harmonic map is a natural and canonical choice in a given set of maps.  The understanding of the properties of this map is mathematically interesting in itself but also essential as it represents many important phenomena in the natural sciences.  <br/>"

One of the main goals of the proposal is to classify all of the properly embedded minimal surfaces which can be parametrized by domains in the Euclidean plane and to describe the asymptotic geometry of all finite genus examples. Related theoretical techniques concerning compactness, regularity and convergence of minimal surfaces of locally bounded genus will be investigated as well. As an outgrowth of his recent joint manuscript with Charles Froman  on the topological classification for minimal surfaces, the researcher proposes to prove that Bryant surfaces in hyperbolic three-space are unknotted.<br/><br/>Classical minimal surface theory has its roots in 18-th and 19-th century mathematics. Minimal surfaces are the first important examples of what is called the calculus of variations, first described by Euler around 1735. Physically minimal surfaces can be modeled locally as soap films on wires or by surfaces of least-area relative to their boundaries. Minimal surfaces represent stationary fluid interfaces, and so their shapes arise in many physical problems. The work in this proposal will help classify the possible physical shapes which might occur as such interfaces. Many of the known examples of minimal surfaces are observed physically, and so it is of interest to have a rigorous theorem which predicts the shapes which can occur. In part because of important connections with other areas of mathematics and because it is possible to make beautiful computer graphics pictures of classical examples, minimal surfaces continue to be one of the principal topics for popular science articles and public science exhibits. Thus, indirerctly, the exciting research problems outlined in this proposal help bring many young scientists and mathematicians to the froniters of research.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The first is the study of rigidity theorems (i.e. metric uniqueness) on compact manifolds with and without boundary.  The second is the study of sharp isoperimetric inequalities.  Here ""isoperimetric inequality"" should be interpreted as an inequality between global geometric quantities (such as volume, volume of the boundary, eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, lengths of closed geodesics etc.) while sharp means that the inequalities are the best possible.  They are related in that the case of equality in appropriate sharp isoperimetric inequalities can lead to interesting rigidity results.We consider for example isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or Lengths of closed geodesics) be isometric.  This also includes questions about metric rigidity induced by conjugacy of geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems.  Another theme of the proposal is the study of infinite groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively curved spaces H (in the sense of Alexandrov).  The project is to study the relationship between the geometry of H and the induced action of G on the ideal boundary of H.  This is an aspect of geometric<br/>group theory.    <br/><br/>The rigidity theme of the project concerns the question of whether a space can be determined by a certain set of data.  One part of this relates to questions of remote sensing.  For example: can you determine the density of an object (say a person's body or the moon) from measurements taken ""from the outside""?  The CAT scan is a practical example where one determines the mass density (or more accurately the absorption coefficient) of an object from measurements of the total mass along straight lines.  An alternative set of measurements is the set of times it takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary (this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in the proposal).  A related set of measurements is to record the exit times and directions of geodesics given their entry directions (this is the ""geodesic lens"" or ""scattering"" data).  The thrust of the proposed study is to determine under which circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of closed geodesics, distances between boundary points, lens data) are sufficient to completely determine the geometry of the spaces in question.  In some cases it is non-uniqueness that is interesting.  For example, in cloaking the goal is to make it the space in question (the object to be cloaked) appear from the outside like a different space (empty space).<br/><br/>"

The intellectual merit of this project derives in part from the central importance of these problems to the general theory of Differential Geometry for real and complex manifolds. We have previously worked on these topics and obtained some results, and we believe our specific approaches of this project offer the promise of important progress.<br/><br/>We believe that the project will have broad impact to the basic theory of Differential Geometry for Kaehler and Riemannian manifolds.

There are many mathematical theories of geometry- Euclid's theory of triangles, Gauss's theory of the obstructions to flattening a surface, Poincare's theory of the most abstract properties unique to a sphere. But none of these seem to have captured what humans mean when they say this object is heart-shaped but that one is kidney-shaped. Automated analysis of medical scans requires that these issues be addressed. Humans have no difficulty answering questions about how similar two shapes are. This suggests two types of mathematical models. On the one hand, one might define precisely a measure of dissimilarity of two shapes, a so-called metric on the set of all shapes. On the other, one might define a probability distribution whose values represent the probability that one shape is likely to belong to the same category as the first. Both constructions are, however, not simple extensions of known mathematics because the set of all shapes is infinite dimensional: this means that any given shape can be wiggled or stretched in infinitely many distinct ways, that no finite set of numbers can fully describe any given shape. Thus new mathematics is needed to create the tools to work with shapes. It is hoped that the ideas behind this study may impact work in recognizing, identifying and comparing the objects present in any type of imaging such as MRI's and CAT-scans.<br/><br/>More precisely, this study starts from the observation that a shape (a closed surface in 3-space or a curve in the plane) can be viewed as a point in an infinite dimensional manifold. Even though the space of shapes is not linear, i.e. two shapes cannot, in any natural way, be added, the set of small deformations of a shape does form a vector space, namely the vector space of normal vector fields along the shape. Having a manifold, differential geometry can be used to define and study metrics on the space of shapes. Recent work has shown that a rich family of Riemannian metrics exists on this space with many different properties. Each one has its own geodesic equations and curvature tensor which have strikingly different properties. This project proposes to study two questions in particular: (a) the curvature for the Riemannian metric inherited from Sobolev norms on the diffeomorphism group of the ambient space and (b) the relationship between the features of the plane curve and its representation in the arguably most natural metric, the Weil-Petersson metric. We also seek to study the probability distributions on the space of shapes obtained as the marginals of diffusion processes associated to these metrics. We finally propose to make a database of scanned 2D shapes on which to compare the many metrics which have been proposed and to study clustering and the fitting of probability models to data. At present, there seem to be several good candidate metrics for applications so a comparative study is very important.<br/><br/>"

Auroux, Katzarkov, <br/>Kontsevich, Orlov and Seidel will lead a concerted effort to formulate <br/>and understand homological mirror symmetry in systematic manner, and <br/>extend it to varieties of general type and to noncommutative varieties. <br/>This will require some foundational work in homological algebra, <br/>noncommutative geometry, and symplectic geometry. Another goal is to <br/>investigate applications of mirror symmetry to classical problems in <br/>algebraic geometry (for example studying the rationality of certain <br/>algebraic varieties) and symplectic topology (in particular, Lagrangian <br/>submanifolds). <br/><br/><br/>From a wider perspective, the project aims to provide a mathematical <br/>counterpart to some recent advances in theoretical physics. The <br/>contribution that mathematics can make is to verify the soundness and <br/>consistency of physical intuition, and to prepare the general ground <br/>on which further development can occur. This is particularly important <br/>in those situations where developments in physics suggest the presence <br/>of deep and complex structures, which are difficult to detect by direct <br/>experiment. At the same time, this effort will make it possible to answer <br/>some purely mathematical (geometric) questions, some of which have been <br/>open for a long time. <br/>The collaborative effort will be carried out through regular meetings <br/>and workshops, and by fostering interaction between leading experts in <br/>the field and younger mathematicians (graduate students and postdocs); <br/>dissemination of knowledge in this rapidly evolving area of mathematics <br/>will be facilitated by regularly held winter and summer schools and <br/>conferences."

The workshop will focus on a key aspect of the structure and classification of complex algebraic varieties: the conjectures of Lang and others on the existence and properties of algebraic and holomorphic curves in complex varieties.  Both analytic and algebraic techniques have recently played a role in making inroads into these conjectures, which are related to Mori's program on the algebraic side and which refine Nevanlinna's Second Main Theorem on the analytic side.  The workshop will bring the experts in algebraic geometry and complex analysis together to foster further interaction and collaboration. <br/><br/>Complex algebraic varieties, which are the solution sets of polynomial equations, provide models for describing physical problems in science and engineering.  The understanding of the structure and classification of these varieties is a central theme in both algebraic geometry and complex analysis.  The workshop will introduce recent developments in this area to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior mathematicians.  Approximately 50 mathematicians, at all stages in their research careers, are expected to participate; eight of the invited speakers are postdoctoral researchers or junior faculty members.  In addition to the scheduled talks, we shall provide ample time for open discussions during the afternoons in order to encourage active participation by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  Most of the funding will go towards paying travel expenses of graduate students, young mathematicians and members of under-represented groups."
