The first part is research in conformal geometry. <br/>The second part is a continuation of the research of <br/>formation and structure of singularity developed along <br/>geometric flows. For conformal geometry part it takes surface <br/>theory as the guideline of geometry in higher dimension. The <br/>theory of conformally flat structure, in 4 dimension for <br/>instance, has not been so successful because of the lack of <br/>right analytic tools, in our view point.  But it seems that <br/>some replacement of complex analysis by theory of fourth <br/>order PDE is found to be very promising to study conformal <br/>geometry. Therefore the  main thread in the part of this <br/>proposed research is to further develop conformal geometry <br/>with those newly developed analytic tools. The proposed <br/>research takes a fundamental and comprehensive approach <br/>to the study of conformal geometry. It will significantly <br/>enhance and develop the conformal geometry.  It will also <br/>provide some ways to better understand topology in 3 and 4 <br/>dimension. For the second part of this proposed project we <br/>continue our research in the study of formation and structure <br/>of singularity developed along the heat flow for harmonic <br/>maps from surfaces. It is always very interesting to <br/>understand the behavior of the flow across the finite time <br/>singularity. The better understanding of the finite time <br/>singularity is believed to be very helpful in further <br/>applications of the theory of harmonic maps in topology and <br/>physics.<br/><br/>The development of conformal geometry has a very long <br/>history and extensive literature. It is intimately tied with<br/>modern physics as we have seen it in conformal field theory.<br/>Particularly it becomes even more important as the correspondence <br/>between quantum gravity and conformal field theory relatively<br/>well understood in physics demands mathematical foundation, as<br/>well as stimulates development in conformal geometry. Therefore<br/>it is clear that conformal geometry is an exciting frontier of<br/>modern sciences. Singularities naturally develop in many <br/>mathematical models for almost everything in sciences. Singularity,<br/>for instance, develop when some parameters in the physical system <br/>approach certain critical values, like Ginzburg-Landau model in <br/>super-conductivity and super-fluids. To study the singularities in <br/>evolution systems have been the major problems in the theory of <br/>partial differential equations with tremendous applications to <br/>many physical and engineering fields. Any essential analytic <br/>progress in this line will greatly attract attention from experts <br/>in all related areas. At last, but not the least, the proposed <br/>project is also generating research activities to the benefit<br/>of the graduate program in the Department of Mathematics at UCSC.<br/>"

Feehan<br/><br/>The principal goal of our research is to prove the celebrated <br/>formula of Edward Witten (1994), relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten series of smooth four-manifolds. Witten used <br/>quantum field theory methods to derive his celebrated formula, <br/>based on the concept of `duality', whereas the approach we <br/>have been pursuing jointly with Thomas Leness is a mathematical <br/>one, employing a moduli space of non-abelian monopoles as a <br/>cobordism between links of Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten <br/>moduli spaces. We have already partially verified Witten's <br/>formula using this approach, showing that in many cases the <br/>series agree up through terms of order depending only on <br/>the topology of the four-manifold. We aim to build on <br/>those results, by showing next that a relation between the <br/>two series of the overall expected shape exists and then <br/>applying auxiliary techniques to prove that his formula is <br/>the only one possible.  A second goal of our research is to<br/>develop a proof of Witten's formula, in the special case of <br/>symplectic four-manifolds equipped with Lefschetz fibrations, <br/>and shed light on the relationship between Seiberg-Witten <br/>invariants, Donaldson invariants, and the structure of Lefschetz fibrations. Ultimately, we also hope to explain the relationship between the mathematical and quantum field theory methods of <br/>deriving Witten's formula.<br/><br/>Witten's formula, as understood by mathematicians, is part of a physical theory developed by Witten and Nathan Seiberg relating non-abelian Yang-Mills theory (a generalization of Maxwell's <br/>theory of electromagnetics) and the simpler abelian Seiberg-Witten gauge field theories. In the physical world, quantum Yang-Mills theories provide a theoretical basis for describing elementary <br/>particle interactions. In the mathematical world, beginning with <br/>the work of Simon Donaldson in 1983, classical Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten gauge theories have played a fundamental role <br/>in probing the geometry of four-dimensional spaces. String<br/>theory is often cited by physicists as the most promising <br/>candidate for a unification of quantum field theory (itself <br/>is a unification of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong <br/>forces) and Einstein's theory of gravity. Such a `grand <br/>unified theory' would give a single theoretical framework <br/>for explaining both short-range, high-energy elementary <br/>particle interactions and the long-range gravitational force. <br/>However, discovery of such a unified framework has eluded <br/>physicists for nearly three-quarters of a century. Furthermore, <br/>while Einstein's theory of gravity is founded on rigorous <br/>mathematics, the goal of providing a mathematical foundation <br/>for quantum field theory has not yet been realized. Most <br/>physicists agree that particle accelerators of impossibly <br/>large size would be needed to experimentally verify that <br/>string theory is the `right' theory of nature. However, <br/>while independent, mathematical verifications of quantum<br/>field theory predictions can never replace experimental tests, <br/>they may increase our confidence that quantum field theory <br/>predictions are correct when experimental checks are impossible <br/>with current technology. We hope that our project may serve as a <br/>small step in such directions.<br/><br/>"

Schoen, of constrained variational<br/>problems for lagrangian cycles. In its most basic form the problem <br/>can be posed as follows: Consider a symplectic<br/>manifold with a metric compatible with the symplectic form. Fix a <br/>homology class that can be represented by a lagrangian cycle. <br/>Find a lagrangian cycle that minimizes volume <br/>among all lagrangian cycles representing this class and derive optimal regularity of this cycle. <br/>In the case that the symplectic manifold is Kaehler,<br/>with Kaehler-Einstein metric, sufficient regularity of the minimizer <br/>implies that the minimizer is both lagrangian and minimal (zero mean curvature). <br/>If the first Chern class is negative such submanifolds could be unique, in a suitable sense,<br/>and then useful in understanding the geometry of the ambient manifold. <br/>If the Kaehler manifold is a Calabi-Yau manifold sufficient regularity implies <br/>that the minimizer is a calibrated submanifold, a special lagrangian submanifold.<br/>We propose to investigate the existence and regularity of this and <br/>related varitional problems and to study the consequences of these results on the<br/>geometry of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A consequence of the proposal is an existence theorem for special <br/>lagrangian submanifolds of a Calabi-Yau manifold.<br/>This result is an essential part of the program proposed by <br/>Strominger-Yau-Zaslow for the geometric construction of ""mirror<br/>symmetry"". Mirror symmetry is one of the most interesting and <br/>important problems currently being studied in mathematics and <br/>theoretical physics. At its core it proposes a duality between a class of <br/>manifolds called Calabi-Yau manifolds. This duality allows <br/>computations to be performed on one manifold that yield a result for its ""mirror"". <br/>Thus computations that are otherwise extremely difficult can be achieved.<br/>The realization of mirror symmetry will effect such diverse subjects <br/>as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, topology, partial <br/>differential  equations and string theory.<br/>The current interest in this subject helps bridge the gap between <br/>physics and mathematics. In two-dimensions our proposal has some <br/>close analogies to a well-known model problem<br/>in non-linear elasticity. The regularity theory developed here will <br/>shed light on the difficult regularity problems of that theory. <br/>Finally this problem is the first attempt to make a systematic study <br/>of a variational problem with a geometric constaint. <br/>This idea will have other important applications in <br/>geometry and its applications.<br/>"

The aim is to develop<br/>effective methods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants of <br/>symplectic manifolds and enumerative invariants of algebraic <br/>manifolds. This work builds on the P.I.'s recent work with E. Ionel <br/>on the `sympletic sum formula' for GW invariants. The first project   <br/>involves extending the sum formula to the `modified  GW invariants' <br/>recently defined by the P.I.'s student Junho Lee. This would make the <br/>formula applicable to  K\""ahler surfaces with $p_g>0$ where there are<br/>important  conjectures that are not currently approachable by GW<br/>methods. The second project is a symplectic approach to understanding <br/>physicists' predictions about the generating functions which count <br/>curves in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The goal is to prove the predicted <br/>formulas by adapting some analytic methods C. Taubes  developed to relate <br/>the Seiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants. The last two projects also relate <br/>to the sympletic sum formula.  One seeks  formulas  expressing the <br/>relative Gromov-Witten invariants of a pair $(X,V)$ in terms of the<br/>usual GW invariants and the descendant classes of $X$ and $V$.  The <br/>other proposes  extending the sum formula to a more general type of <br/>symplectic sum which occurs in algebraic geometry when one considers <br/>projective linear systems.<br/><br/><br/>One of the most basic problems in mathematics is to determine the <br/>solutions of a system of polynomial equations, and an important first <br/>step toward that goal is to determine the NUMBER of solutions.  There <br/>is an explicit formula for the number of simultaneous solutions of a <br/>set of n  polynomials in n variables.  One can then ask for the <br/>number of  solutions for n  polynomials in n-1 variables.  In this <br/>case there is a free parameter, so the locus of solutions will be a <br/>union of curves.  How many?  This question has been systematically <br/>studied for 100 years, but only a few  special cases<br/>were solved.   Then, around 1990, it was realized that these problems <br/>can be translated into symplectic geometry, and then tackeled using <br/>the powerful machinery of mathematical gauge theory. (Gauge theory, <br/>originally part of physics, has been the focus of many very fruitful <br/>interactions between mathematicians and physicists  over the past <br/>twenty years; it includes Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten theory, and <br/>String theory).  This  `Gromov-Witten invariant' approach led quickly <br/>to formulas answering some of the original enumerative problems, and <br/>there are clear indications that there are more to be discovered. <br/>This project is  aimed toward further developing the symplectic gauge <br/>theory in order to produce<br/>additional general formulas and to meld these formulas into a coherent theory.<br/>"

In the class of closed, positively curved manifolds, there<br/>are few restrictions, most of which are classical, such as the<br/>Bonnet-Myers and Synge theorems. For closed, simply connected manifolds,<br/>there is essentially just Gromov's theorem bounding the total Betti number<br/>in a given dimension. Given that there are few known obstructions, it is<br/>frustrating that the set of known examples, although infinite, is<br/>relatively small. My research is concerned with understanding the geometry<br/>and topology of the known examples. More specifically, the goals are: 1)<br/>to attempt to find new examples of positively curved manifolds by studying<br/>more general metrics on biquotients (in collaboration with J.-H.<br/>Eschenburg), 2) to compute the isometry groups for the known cohomogeneity<br/>one manifolds of positive curvature and 3) to see whether the<br/>7-dimensional Berger space is diffeomorphic to a 3-sphere bundle over the<br/>4-sphere (in collaboration with N. Kitchloo).<br/><br/>Riemannian geometry arose from trying to understand curvature. <br/>Intuitively, we know that tabletops are flat while basketballs and saddles<br/>are curved.  Geometers are able to quantify curvature precisely and it<br/>provides a numerical invariant that helps distinguish objects.  For<br/>instance, the surface of a doughnut and the surface of a coffee cup have<br/>the same nature i.e., they are both surfaces with one hole, but they are<br/>shaped differently. On the other hand, the surface of a ball (usually<br/>called a sphere) is different in shape and nature from the surface of a<br/>doughnut (usually called a torus). How can we be sure that this is always<br/>the case? One may wonder if it is possible to deform the sphere suitably<br/>so that we might end up with the torus. A sphere has positive curvature<br/>everywhere while it can be shown that no matter what shape a torus takes,<br/>it will always have zero curvature somewhere. This tells us that the two<br/>objects are somehow fundamentally different from each other.  Differential<br/>geometry is also the language used to express the general theory of<br/>relativity, our best theoretical description of gravity and its effects on<br/>the universe.

In addition they will study the finer <br/>structure of these moduli spaces. In particular, they will <br/>study commutative and noncommutative Hamiltonian systems of differential equations on these spaces and use the quantizations <br/>of these systems to obtain results about the representation <br/>theory of compact Lie groups and of the Artin groups of Lie <br/>type. Millson and B.Leeb have obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for the moduli spaces of n-gon linkages in Lie <br/>algebras to be nonempty generalizing well-known results of <br/>Klyachko for sl(n,C).

In some cases, Millson and <br/>H.Flaschka have constructed (commutative) integrable <br/>Hamiltonian systems on these spaces but the flows are <br/>not periodic. For applications to the representation <br/>theory of compact Lie groups it is critical to find the <br/>associated ""action variables,"" i.e. find Hamiltonians <br/>with periodic flows which are functions of the original Poisson-commuting Hamiltonians. Millson and Toledano-Laredo <br/>have constructed representations of Artin groups of Lie <br/>type by quantizing certain noncommutative Hamiltonian systems. <br/>They hope to construct the trigonometric analogues of their <br/>quantum systems. The results just mentioned may be found at http://www.math.umd.edu/~jjm.<br/>        <br/>Millson's work begins with one of the first theorems of <br/>high-school geometry - the theorem that if two triangles <br/>have the same set of side lengths then they are congruent.  <br/>The analogue for quadrilaterals is clearly false: one can <br/>change a square into a rhombus without changing the side<br/>lengths. So one is led to try to parametrize the set of <br/>all planar n-gons with the same side lengths. From there <br/>one is led to a favorite theme of nineteenth century <br/>mathematics, the study of planar linkages (systems of<br/>rods and hinges).  In the nineteenth century such a <br/>study was of immense practical significance - the problem <br/>was to convert linear motion (of a piston rod) to circular <br/>motion (turn a wheel) by a linkage. The problem was<br/>solved by a French naval officer, Peaucellier.  It turns <br/>out that from the modern point of view the nineteenth <br/>century work is insufficiently precise.  Millson and <br/>Kapovich have corrected the errors and written up a proof <br/>of a result (often attributed to Thurston) that, given <br/>any smooth manifold M, there is a planar linkage whose <br/>configuration space is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union <br/>of a number of copies of M.  This result will appear in<br/>the journal ""Topology"".  The above work on planar linkages <br/>led to a study of n-gon linkages in space.  This theory is <br/>enormously richer, connecting with symplectic geometry, <br/>integrable Hamiltonian systems and representation theory.<br/>The analogous theory in spherical and hyperbolic three-space <br/>and their generalizations (compact Lie groups and the <br/>symmetric spaces of their complexifications) appears to <br/>connect up with some of the newest objects in geometry <br/>and algebra, for example Poisson Lie groups and <br/>quantum groups.<br/><br/>"

By thinking of discrete groups -- such as fundamental groups of compact manifolds -- in terms of their Cayley graphs, one can view them  as geometric objects in their own right.  This viewpoint, which is present throughout the proposal, leads to  some remarkable insights (Mostow rigidity, Stallings' theorem, Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, etc.) and to the striking fact that many discrete groups (for example word  hyperbolic groups) act in a canonical way on a ``boundary''.  The first part of the proposed research focusses on biLipschitz maps.  A byproduct of the project, if it is successful, will be an answer to the question of when certain aperiodic tilings of the plane (for example,  Penrose tilings) are weakly combinatorially equivalent to the usual square tiling, in the sense that one can  match the tiles of the two tilings so that adjacent tiles are matched with nearby tiles.  The second project addresses  Solv, the only 3-dimensional  Thurston geometry that remains mysterious from a large-scale viewpoint. The  remaining topics concern important issues in the fields of  nonpositively curved spaces (the dynamics of the geodesic flow and the structure of the fundamental group), hyperbolic groups (the topology of the boundary and its relation to group structure),  and Poincare duality groups (the relation between Haken PD(3)  groups and 3-manifold groups).  <br/><br/>The proposal has two main themes: symmetry,  classification, and recognition of tiling patterns; and dynamics.  Tilings of the plane and 3-space have been studied intensely for centuries, and the resulting theory is fundamental in many branches of mathematics, as well as in solid state physics (crystal structure).  In the 1970's, mathematicians discovered striking new applications of tilings (especially tilings of hyperbolic space, the geometry underlying a number  of Escher's images),  by using the ``rough'' pattern of the tilings rather than the precise shape of the tiles and their intersection pattern. >From this new viewpoint  two tilings would be considered ""roughly the same"" if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the tiles of one tiling with the tiles of the other so that adjacent tiles in one tiling correspond to nearby tiles in the other.  This is a very active area of research with connections to many areas of mathematics.  Several of the proposed research topics  relate to this: for example it is an open problem if the  tilings associated with quasi-crystal structure are always roughly the same as classical crystal tilings. Another theme in the proposal is geodesic motion -- the  motion of a free particle --  in a certain class of  spaces.  These systems have a long history and provide especially simple examples of  ``chaotic'' mechanical systems; they can also be used to model a system of several billiard balls on a billiard table with circular (or convex) bumpers. The objective here is to describe and classify, at least in  certain classes of examples, all possible trajectories of the system.    <br/>"

Approximation of Riemannian <br/>manifolds by polyhedral metrics and generalization of Alexandrov embedding<br/>theorem. The PI has proved that approximability by polyhedral metrics<br/>implies a new kind of curvature bound which appears naturally but has never been<br/>considered in geometry before. The proof is interesting in its own right,<br/>as it uses a Lemma closely resembling the Alexandrov embedding theorem<br/>(which states that any positively curved metric on a 2-sphere is isometric<br/>to a convex surface in a Euclidean space). This brings us back to a more<br/>geometrical point of view on Riemannian Geometry, according to which<br/>``interesting'' curvature bounds should arise from properties of<br/>embeddings of manifolds into Euclidean space. This circle of ideas also<br/>gives a new approach to the old conjecture that every simply connected<br/>Riemannian manifold with positive curvature operator is diffeomorphic to a<br/>sphere; <br/>2. Collapsing with lower curvature bound. The general goal of this topic<br/>is to understand how collapsing with lower curvature and diameter bounds<br/>happens and, in the very best case, to construct a structure analogous to<br/>the one obtained by Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov for the case of bounded<br/>curvature.<br/>3. Gate spaces.  Gate spaces are related to a circle of problems arising<br/>from the question of K.Grove of whether there is an Alexandrov space that<br/>has two different smoothings into Riemannian manifolds of the same<br/>dimension and lower curvature bound;<br/>4. Applications of megafolds to collapsing with bounded curvature and to <br/>Ricci flow.  Megafolds are a generalization of Riemannian manifolds and<br/>orbifolds that has already proved it usefulness for collapsing with<br/>bounded curvature; in particular, they were used by the PI to prove, in<br/>coloboration with W.Tuschmann, the main part of the Klingenberg-Sakai<br/>Conjecture. Such a collapsing also arises naturally from the rescaling of<br/>the Ricci flow; it can be used to construct singularity models for the<br/>Ricci flow with no injectivity radius estimates; <br/>5. Theory of Alexandrov spaces.  Alexandrov spaces appear naturally as<br/>limits of Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bound. Most geometric<br/>results which are true for Riemaninan manifolds with lower curvature bound<br/>are also true for Alexandrov spaces; however, there are several such<br/>results that cannot be generalized. For example, it is not known whether a<br/>convex hypersurface in an Alexandrov space is also an Alexandrov<br/>space. Such problems are mostly due to the lack of local analysis, and<br/>that is what the PI proposes to study.<br/><br/><br/>Riemannian manifold, which could be considered as a simplified version of<br/>space-time, is a way too complicated object. The first topic in this<br/>proposal is aimed at studing Riemanian manifolds by means of approximation<br/>by simpler objects. These objects are polyhedral spaces, i.e. spaces glued<br/>of Euclidean polyhedra. The other topics considers a different approach to<br/>studing Riemannian manifolds. It is based on considering extremal metrics,<br/>in an appropriate sense, for example how Riemannian manifolds collapse to<br/>lower dimenssional objects. This method makes possible to get new results<br/>in the main stream direction of Riemannian geometry: how to make<br/>conclusions about global structure of space basing on local properties.<br/><br/>"

(For example, in a river where the current is<br/>faster in midstream it turns out that downstream geodesics are stable, but<br/>that upstream geodesics are not.) The geometric quantity that measures this<br/>notion of stability is known as 'curvature', since it was first identified<br/>in studies of the curvature of the Earth.  Bryant's work studies curvature<br/>and 'over-determined' systems of differential equations, and is relevant<br/>to optimization problems in motion planning, control theory, robotics,<br/>and string theory models in high energy physics.  Some of the specific<br/>problems he works on are aimed at applications to mathematical physics<br/>(e.g., connections with parallel spinor fields) or control theory (e.g.,<br/>Finsler geometry, which is the subject that studies problems such as<br/>the navigation problem mentioned above), while others are aimed at more<br/>foundational questions about the nature of minimizers (e.g., volume<br/>minimizing cycles in Lie groups) or the limits and/or possibilities inherent<br/>in the current methods and techniques for minimization problems<br/>(e.g., special Lagrangian geometry and almost complex 6-manifolds).<br/><br/>"

They develop implementations of discrete<br/>conformal mapping for multidisciplinary use, both within<br/>mathematics itself where complex analysis is being reinvigorated<br/>by new discrete techniques, and in the larger scientific context<br/>with visualization and analysis of scientific data.  The Riemann<br/>Mapping Theorem guarantees unique conformal maps between any pair<br/>of conformal 2-discs (or conformal 2-spheres); the conformal<br/>geometry preserved by such maps carries valuable mathematical<br/>structure.  Such surfaces arise naturally in many scientific<br/>contexts as piecewise flat (from data) or smoothly embedded (from<br/>theory) surfaces in 3-space.  Recently the new computational<br/>technique of circle packing has allowed computational<br/>approximations to these conformal maps.  Implementing such<br/>approximations for large scientific datasets faces both<br/>theoretical and computational challenges.  The investigator and<br/>his colleagues work on three related topics: theoretical<br/>superstructure of the circle packing technique, refinement and<br/>parallelization of the circle packing algorithm for use on large<br/>datasets, and the application of these conformal maps to<br/>visualization and analysis of scientific data.  The main<br/>application focuses on conformal flattening of human brain<br/>cortical surfaces.  The investigators use uniqueness of conformal<br/>maps to install surface-based coordinate systems on these<br/>surfaces; these coordinate systems allow localization of<br/>activation foci in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and<br/>functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain scans.<br/>Conformal flattening has wider applicability as a visualization<br/>and graph embedding technique, and these connections inform the<br/>research.<br/>     This Focused Research Group develops algorithms to bring a<br/>classical mathematics theorem (the Riemann Mapping Theorem, 1854)<br/>to bear on problems of visualization of data.  The Riemann Mapping<br/>Theorem guarantees the existence of unique conformal<br/>(angle-preserving) maps between surfaces, but does say how to<br/>compute these maps.  Modern computers and new algorithms have<br/>changed all that, because our new computational ability can<br/>breathe life into classical existence theorems of mathematics,<br/>turning theory into computational tools.  This project develops<br/>algorithms to implement the computation of conformal maps on<br/>complex spatial surfaces.  The main application is the flat<br/>mapping of human brain cortical surfaces.  The brain surface is<br/>highly convoluted and folded in space, and most of the brain<br/>surface is folded up and hidden from view.  If one flattens the<br/>surface, one can simultaneously see down into all the folds.  The<br/>mathematically unique conformal maps produced by the algorithms<br/>allow surface-based coordinate systems to be computed on the<br/>brain surface so that surface positions can be precisely<br/>determined.  Moreover, if one puts foci of functional activation<br/>onto the flattened surface, one can then visualize and measure<br/>the relationship between brain function and brain anatomy.  These<br/>new surface-mapping techniques and their application to the brain<br/>surface permit biomedical researchers and clinicians to rapidly<br/>and accurately map and compare the locations of physiological and<br/>pathological ""events"" in the brains of research subjects and of<br/>patients with a variety of neurological and psychiatric<br/>disorders.

Schoen<br/><br/>Professor Schoen is proposing to study the existence of an extremal metric<br/>which defines the Bartnik quasilocal mass for a domain in a spacetime of<br/>general relativity. This would yield an existence theorem for<br/>asymptotically flat solutions of the static vacuum Einstein equations with<br/>suitable boundary conditions. It is part of a variational approach for<br/>constructing three dimensional geometries. Schoen's second project<br/>involves the construction of special lagrangian, and more generally<br/>minimal lagrangian, submanifolds in Calabi-Yau and Kaehler-Einstein<br/>manifolds. The approach is to construct hamiltonian stationary<br/>submanifolds by direct volume minimization among lagrangian submanifolds,<br/>and to obtain sufficient regularity to show that they are minimal<br/>lagrangian. Schoen's third project is to further develop the harmonic map<br/>approach to prove the rigidity of smooth actions of lattices in semisimple<br/>Lie groups on compact manifolds. Professor Mutao Wang proposes to study<br/>the mean curvature flow for special classes of submanifolds of<br/>codimension greater than one. The major thrust is to obtain stability and<br/>regularity properties of the flow. Dr. Baozhang Yang will study singular<br/>behavior of Yang-Mills connections in arbitrary dimension. This study will<br/>include an investigation into the structure of blow-up sets and asymptotic<br/>behavior near singularities.<br/><br/> <br/>This research project concerns the study of geometric shapes which<br/>optimize certain physical and geometric energies. For curved spacetimes in<br/>general relativity, there is no natural mass-energy density which can be<br/>assigned to the gravitational field, so Bartnik proposed to measure the<br/>gravitational mass of a region in a spacetime by minimizing the total mass<br/>of all physical spacetimes which contain this region as a subset. This<br/>minimal mass spacetime, if it can be shown to exist, will be a static<br/>solution of Einstein's equations. One of the goals of this project is to<br/>find a way to construct such static solutions, and to use them to study<br/>three dimensional geometry. It is expected that three dimensional spaces<br/>have natural geometries on them which are uniquely characterized by their<br/>curvature properties. Another goal of this project is to construct certain<br/>special surfaces in Calabi-Yau manifolds, the spaces of string<br/>theory. These (three dimensional) surfaces, called special lagrangian<br/>submanifolds, are analogous to soap films in that they are surfaces of  <br/>least possible area. Finally, it is proposed to study the evolution<br/>problem for surfaces which is called the mean curvature evolution. This is<br/>an evolution problem which moves a surface in space in such a way that its<br/>area is decreased most rapidly. Understanding the behavior of this<br/>evolution is important for simplifying and smoothing complicated surfaces<br/>in an optimal way. Mathematically this is a difficult problem because the<br/>surfaces may develop singularities such as cone points and tears which<br/>must be accounted for. <br/><br/>"

A current aim is to<br/>construct examples of minimal submanifolds with singular sets which<br/>include ``gaps'' and other phenomena, the possibility of which is left<br/>open by his previous general work on the structure of the singular<br/>set.  He is also proposing to complete work on the singular set of<br/>mod-2 currents to show that, in all dimensions, the top-dimensional<br/>part of the singular set locally lies in a finite union of<br/>continuously differentiable submanifolds.

Brian White plans to study how regularity properties<br/>and singular structure for minimizing chains with coefficients in a<br/>metric group depend on the group and its metric.

For example, in cosmology singularities of<br/>space-time (e.g. ``black holes'') play a fundamental role.  Likewise<br/>in the study of the ``canonical'' objects which arise naturally in<br/>topology and geometry, singularities arise in a very natural and<br/>unavoidable manner, and the understanding of these singularities is an<br/>absolutely fundamental problem.  As with most non-linear phenomena,<br/>there is not a single general theory which applies in a wide range of<br/>different contexts. Rather, each different context has its own<br/>collection of effective techniques, and it is the development and<br/>application of such techniques in the context of the geometric<br/>calculus of variations which is the focus of the present research<br/>proposal. Specifically, Simon and White propose to continue their<br/>efforts toward a complete understanding of singularities, and how they<br/>are formed, in the context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy<br/>minimizing maps.

Of particular interest<br/>are algebraic cycles and the cycles associated to singularities of mappings<br/>or the higher order contact of geometric structures.  These objects -- of<br/>importance in themselves -- have been shown to have ties to other areas of<br/>mathematics.  A major aim here is the discovery and development of such<br/>ties. The proposal has several interrelated parts. The first concerns groups<br/>of algebraic cycles and cocycles on a projective variety.  A theory of<br/>homology-type based on cycles has been developed by the proposer and<br/>others.  It will be used to study concrete questions about algebraic<br/>spaces.  In a variant of the theory involving real algebraic cycles,<br/>surprizing connections to equivariant homotopy theory have been found.  <br/>The implications for real algebraic geometry will be explored, and the<br/>quaternionic analogues will be studied. A second part of the proposal concerns differential <br/>characters, objects which mediate between cycles and smooth data, and lead to important<br/>geometric invariants. Recent discoveries have been made concerning them --<br/>for example, the existence of a fundamental duality theorem.  Further<br/>development of the theory is proposed.  Geometric results will be sought by<br/>bringing the calculus of variations to bear in this domain.  A third area of the proposal <br/>concerns the study of singularities and characteristic forms. The subject includes <br/>a generalization of Chern-Weil theory which gives canonical homologies between singularities <br/>of bundle maps and characteristic forms.  Many applications concerning the global<br/>geometry of singularities,  and its relation to characteristic classes and<br/>differential characters, will be investigated.  A forth area is concerned with special <br/>cycles in geometry:  Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, and associative <br/>and Cayley cycles in G(2) and Spin(7) spaces. These latter subjects relate to gauge<br/>field theory and gravity in Physics as well as many areas of geometry and<br/>algebra.<br/><br/>                               <br/>A concept of central importance in geometry is that of a ``cycle''.<br/>In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the simultaneous solution of a<br/>system of polynomial equations. In differential geometry   cycles arise in<br/>many ways: as the large scale solutions of certain differential equations,<br/>and as the level sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.<br/>Curves and surfaces in space are simple examples.  This proposal is<br/>concerned with the study of certain important classes of cycles which arise<br/>in geometry.  Part of the study aims at relating them to fundamental<br/>large-scale geometry of the surrounding  space. In the algebraic case this<br/>has led to the establishment of surprizing and important relationships<br/>between spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental constructions in<br/>algebraic topology that have led to new insights in both fields.  This work<br/>will be continued with the intent of obtaining further concrete<br/>applications. A second part of the proposal concerns differential characters,<br/>objects which mediate between cycles and smooth data. They lead to<br/>important geometric invariants and have appeared in discussions of the<br/>``Mirror Symmetry Conjecture'' from modern physics. The proposer has made<br/>some recent discoveries about characters, including a basic Duality<br/>Theorem. Further development of the theory and its applications is<br/>proposed.   Another area of investigation  is concerned with relations<br/>between cycles and geometry which arise from connections.  Connections are<br/>fundamental in mathematics, where they constitute differentiation laws, and<br/>in physics, where they represent the fundamental forces of nature at the<br/>classical level.  The investigator has developed a theory of singular connections which<br/>encompasses much previously unrelated phenomena and has applications to<br/>many areas of geometry.  The proposal will continue this work with<br/>emphasis on applications. Yet another area of the proposal is concerned<br/>with very special cycles in geometry which relate to gauge field theory and<br/>gravity in Physics as well as many areas of geometry and algebra. <br/>This project will also be concerned with graduate student development.<br/>Students will be part of the research team.  There will also be an<br/>undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering mathematical<br/>independence and developing interactive environments.<br/>"

Recently, I am working on three major <br/>directions: (1) Classification of compact hyperkahler manifolds, (2) <br/>Stability and extremal metrics, (3) Classification of Complex homogeneous<br/>spaces. Our research was highly concentrated on these directions for the last <br/>4 to 5 years. We expect to work on extremal metrics and hyperkahler manifolds<br/>for some other years since many breakthroughs are happenning in these <br/>directions. The picture for extremal metrics is becoming clear after many <br/>years of research. It can be described by the geodesic stability principles. <br/>The uniqueness comes from the convex property of the modified Mabuchi <br/>functional on Mabuchi moduli space of Kahler metrics and the existence of <br/>geodesics between Kahler metrics [GM4]. The existence should be the same as <br/>the geodesic stability [GM7]. I already test these principles by both the <br/>examples in my dissertation and those in [GM7]. For the toric manifolds, we <br/>already proved the uniqueness and that existence implies the geodesic <br/>stability. We are trying to solve the final part of the geodesic stability <br/>principles that geodesic stable implies existence for toric manifolds. We also <br/>test the geodesic stability for many toric manifolds, e. g., the manifold <br/>obtained by blowing up two points in a 2 dimensional complex projective space.<br/>This will eventually solve the historical problem of existing Kahler-Einstein<br/>metrics and extremal metrics. The best condidates of Hodge diamonds for the <br/>complex 4 dimensional compact hyperkahler manifolds are described by the <br/>possible pairs of the second and third Betti numbers (5,36),(7,8),(8,0),(23,0)<br/>([GHS4]). Now it is the time to work on classification with many tools as <br/>Lagrangian fibration, Rozansky-Witten invariants, geometric elliptic genera. A<br/>sandwich inequality of Rozansky-Witten invariants suggests further results for <br/>higher dimensional case. The classification of compact complex homogeneous <br/>spaces is reduced to the better understood manifolds as parallelizable <br/>manifolds, reductive spaces and primary spaces in [GH7]. We will try to <br/>understand more about the higher step primary spaces in the future. <br/><br/>The research of Kahler-Einstein metric has been pioneered by many well-known <br/>mathematicians including several Fields Medal receivers. It turns out that<br/>there are many similarity between this field and the Hitchin-Kobayashi<br/>correspondence in the holomorphic vector bundles on compact Kahler manifolds.<br/>Both fields are closed related to Physics Science, e.g., Einstein equation,<br/>general relativity, Yang-Mills, Mirror Symmetry, Calabi-Yau, etc. We will <br/>write up a textbook in Kahler geometry describe a clear picture on both of <br/>these fields. Hyperkahler manifolds and homogeneous manifolds are some <br/>important manifolds which have some physics origin as that of Calabi-Yau <br/>manifolds and are unsolved classical topics in complex geometry. The pictures <br/>for these fields become clearer recently.  <br/>"

The second goal is to test this understanding by developing effective algorithmsfor the statistical inference of this structure, algorithms that work with real data at reasonable speed on current computers.  The general approach is to formulate mathematical representations of patterns, typically compositional with a hierarchy of structures, to encode the variability of these structures in stochastic models, and to use the models to infer information about the image.  Standard stochastic models are rarely adequate, prompting the development of new classes of probability measures or completely new directions for traditional models.  Additionally, in the context of this application the team aims to develop mathematical, statistical, and computational ideas that are of broader use.  For example, compositional issues in vision are similar to ones in the grammars of language.  One aspect of the project studies this connection.<br/><br/>The investigator and his five colleagues continue their mathematical, statistical, and computational investigations of a range of problems motivated by image processing and computer vision.  The underlying question is simple enough: Here's an image, what is it an image of? Despite its simplicity, this is a hard question to answer.  The approach taken here is to decompose the image into different components in some hierarchical structure and to use statistical analysis to infer information about the image from the relationships of the components within the structure.  There are similarities with the grammatical structure of language, which the project explores.  Recognition of objects in an image is a fundamental problem for both computer systems and biological systems.  Advances are important for engineers developing computer vision applications, computer scientists seeking efficient algorithms in problems related to intelligent behavior of machines, and cognitive scientists studying human vision and language skills.

A different kind of geometry arises in the<br/>study of submanifolds as curved objects, where we use several<br/>measurements of bending to capture the intuitive sense that a<br/>sphere in three-space is more curved if its radius is small than<br/>if its radius is large.  An isoparametric submanifold is an<br/>imbedded object which has particularly simple curvature<br/>properties with respect to the larger space, and the character of<br/>this specialty is driven by the fact that this local condition<br/>frequently imposes strong symmetry properties the whole<br/>submanifold.<br/>"

The affirmative solution to this work will<br/>open a new avenue of research about these connections, for which all the <br/>known examples by far have been analytic. He also proposes to investigate<br/>the classification problem of isoparametric hypersurfaces with four<br/>principal curvatures in spheres by investigating the normal holonomy Lie <br/>algebra of a focal submanifold of the hypersurface, which contains the<br/>information about the 2nd fundamental form of the focal submanifold, which<br/>is, by his study, crucial for the classification.  <br/> <br/><br/>If one sets off from the North Pole and travels with a compass along a <br/>loop, one will discover that at the end of the trip back at the North Pole<br/>the compass needle has turned a degree. This says mathematically that parallel<br/>translation (induced by a linear connection) of vectors along loops can<br/>detect whether the space is flat, which is fundamental to Einstein's <br/>Theory of Relativity. In Hermann Weyl's terms, the existence of inertia <br/>systems in the universe warrants that its linear connection is<br/>torsion-free. The project on torsion-free G_3 connections is a study of the <br/>rather anomalous nature of these connections among all exotic holonomies <br/>whose development has been participated by the PI. The notion of<br/>isoparametric hypersurfaces was first proposed in connection with wave <br/>fronts in Euclidean space and recently the more general Dupin hypersurfaces <br/>were tied with integrable hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type. Shortly <br/>after their introduction the isoparametric hypersurfaces were all classified <br/>in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces of all dimensions. The complete <br/>classification of such hypersurfaces in spheres of arbitrary dimensions has <br/>defied people's efforts for nearly six decades, despite many outstanding<br/>results achieved in the past three decades. The PI's second project is to <br/>utilize the normal holonomy and the new approach of him, T. Cecil and G. <br/>Jensen toward the classification in the case of four principal <br/>curvatures. <br/>"

Based on physical ideas and methods, E.Witten<br/>conjectured that certain topological invariants of the moduli spaces<br/>of Riemann surfaces with higher spin structures assemble in a<br/>generating function that can be determined by an infinite system of<br/>differential equations (the so-called Gelfand-Dickey hierarchy).<br/>The goal of the first part of the proposal is to study geometric and<br/>algebraic structures related to this conjecture by using techniques<br/>from the theory of Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum<br/>cohomology. Besides exposing deep connections between seemingly<br/>unrelated areas of geometry and analysis, a goal of this part of the<br/>project is to develop tools for analyzing more general cohomological<br/>field theories of spin type and the corresponding spin analogs of<br/>quantum cohomology and Gromov-Witten invariants. The second part of<br/>the proposal is related to applications and generalizations of the<br/>so-called chiral de Rham complex, a canonical sheaf of vertex<br/>algebras introduced in joint work with Malikov and Schechtman. The<br/>main goal here is to find a rigorous geometric foundation for the<br/>physical models of two-dimensional superconformal field theory on<br/>smooth varieties and orbifolds.<br/><br/>String theory is a proposed physical theory which attempts to unify<br/>all kinds of forces and, in particular, combines Einstein's theory<br/>of gravity with the quantum theory. Because this theory cannot yet<br/>be verified on experiments, physicists working in string theory are<br/>testing it on sophisticated mathematical models. Often the same<br/>physical quantity can be computed by more than one method which<br/>gives answers expressed in terms of very different mathematical<br/>structures. This suggests the existence of deep ties between various<br/>seemingly remote parts of mathematics and leads to formulation of<br/>non-trivial conjectures connecting different mathematical objects,<br/>usually geometric and analytical in nature. The goal of the current<br/>project is a mathematical study of some of these conjectures and<br/>interactions. Besides producing new mathematical results, it should<br/>give mathematical verification of some physical models and provide<br/>more direct links between mathematical and physical methods of<br/>analysis of these models."
