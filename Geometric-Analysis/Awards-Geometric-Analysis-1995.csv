The planned conference inaugurates a series of conferences, The Bers Colloquium, to be held triannually, whose theme will be a topic in the Ahlfors-Bers mathematical tradition. Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers have worked on value distribution theory, Teichmuller space, complex dynamics, and other areas of function theory; have had a significant impact on the modern development of one variable complex function theory.    Ahlfors and Bers can be regarded as founding members of the modern theory of functions of one complex variable, and the proposed conference is a celebration of their mathematical heritage."

The modern study of smooth four-dimensional spaces was initiated, in large measure, by the work of Simon Donaldson in the early eighties; Donaldson used ideas from theoretical physics - Yang-Mills equations and gauge theories - in an ingenious way to help classify smooth four-manifolds. It is worth mentioning that Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten have recently come up with an easier and more direct theory of smooth four-manifolds, again motivated by ideas from theoretical physics, namely monopoles and string theory."

The outcome will be the construction of geometric models of unitary representations.  This work will result in a better understanding of geometric quantization, quantization in general, and the geometry and invariant theory of nilpotent orbits.      The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.

This research   which is at the interface between computational statistics and   computational geometry, will produce an expanded collection   of tools for constructing practical and sharp probability   bounds for a vast   array of applications.

This applies to systems such as a bridge, an   ecosystem, a human body, or a manufacturing method.  The   research explores ways in which special model structure for   situations such as these can be exploited to produce more   efficient and precise probability calculations.  This new   methodology should be directly applicable to manufacturing     and quality control, structural and system reliability,     environmental regulation, and a host of other areas."

An orbihedron is a simply connected simplicial complex with a group of homeomorphisms acting properly discontinuously and preserving the simplicial structure. An orbihedron with an invariant metric is a singular Riemannian manifold in the sense of Alexandrov.    Riemannian manifolds are abstract versions of surfaces in space and their higher dimensional analogs. Originally, Riemannian manifolds were restricted to be smooth without sharp edges. In singular Riemannain geometry, the smoothness requirement is slightly weakened to allow certain singularities. In some sense, the concept of a singular Riemannain manifold is more useful as it includes polyhedral surfaces."

Basic theoretical research goals include the classification of the Lie transformation groups in three-dimensional space, their differential invariants, and the associated Lie algebra cohomology. The applications of these results fall into three broad categories. In computer vision, a new paradigm of image processing based on differential geometric diffusion equations relies on classifying the differential invariant signatures of visual symmetry groups. In quantum mechanics, the analysis of quasi-exactly solvable Schrodinger operators continues to produce significant new developments in the study of Lie algebras of differential operators, including the remarkable phenomenon known as ""quantization of cohomology""; in the present project, the concentration will shift to real planar quantum operators, as well as extensions to a fully three-dimensional theory. In continuum mechanics, the application of equivalence methods and exterior differential systems to the classification of variational problems will be further analyzed with a view to providing canonical forms, geometric invariants, and conservation laws for nonlinear variational problems arising in elasticity.   The goals of this research project are to further our understanding of the mathematical theory of symmetry and invariants in three-dimensional space, motivated by several key physical applications, of importance in physics, engineering and medicine. In computer vision, new methods of image processing promise to have an immediate practical impact in medical imaging, such as the ultrasound detection of breast tumors. In elasticity, the classification of simple forms and symmetries of general materials should have significant consequences in the study of crack propagation and waves. In quantum mechanics, new types of problems some of whose  fundamental states are classified by algebraic tools have known applications to molecular spectroscopy and scattering theory."

These geometries are all generalizations of the geometry of the hyperbolic plane, yet they lack totally geodesic hypersurfaces making it difficult to build fundamental polyhedra - one can construct discrete automorphism groups directly from fundamental polyhedra. A related topic dealing with representation spaces of surface groups is also contained in the proposal: these spaces can be identified with moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles over Riemann surfaces, hence have ramifications in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.    Hyperbolic geometry is the oldest known non-Euclidean geometry, and possesses many interesting properties not encountered in Euclidean geometry. Discrete automorphism groups are closely related to regular polyhedra, and finding them in a non-Euclidean geometry can often be difficult. Collections of these groups are also related to certain gauge theories arising in mathematical physics."

The mirror symmetry conjecture, first observed by physicists, asserts that each Calabi-Yau 3-fold has a 'mirror' (also a Calabi-Yau 3-fold) and that certain structures of a Calabi-Yau manifold are tightly related to seemingly very different structures of its mirror manifold.    The phenomenon of mirror symmetry relates qualitatively different structures arising in theoretical physics, geometry and algebra. The rough idea is that there are structures in theoretical physics which are mirrored in structures in pure mathematics. This entire phenomenon, verified in special cases, remains an intriguing mathematical puzzle."

Function theory is the study of functions of one independent complex variable, and has a classical origin. A notable aspect of function theory is the use of Riemann surfaces; given a locally defined complex function one associates an abstract (multi-sheeted) surface, called the Riemann surface of the function, via analytic continuation. This Riemann surface carries all the essential information about the original function and its possible regular extensions. The proposed project has to do with classifying and understanding the totality of such Riemann surfaces."

In such a context, generating such a trajectory via a smooth control system requires a control system which accepts inputs which are generalized functions in the sense of Colombeau, Oberguggenberger and Rosinger. Alternately, such trajectories may be constructed using a nonlinear spline algorithm.  This research will pursue three directions: (i) the development of the underlying Colombeau generalized function theory in the context of nonlinear control systems; (ii) extension of the spline algorithms of Bezier and deCasteljau developed in the context of flat affine geometry to more general Lie-theoretic and path geometry-theoretic situations; and (iii) application the theories developed in (i) and (ii) to air traffic control technology.    Development of air traffic control algorithms involves dealing exactly or approximately with piecewise smooth trajectories of nonlinear mechanical systems.

When one considers the energy functional for maps from a Lorentzian manifold to a Riemannian manifold, the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations become hyperbolic - for maps between two Riemannian manifolds these equations are elliptic.    Wave maps are called sigma models by physicists, and they arise in modern physics in various guises. For example, Einstein's field equations can be reduced to sigma model equations.

The investigator seeks to lay a mathematical foundation for scattering phenomena and to consider more sophisticated scattering problems, say scattering on finite volume hyperbolic surfaces."
