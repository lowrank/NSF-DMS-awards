Fu<br/><br/>We propose to study the geometry of certain singular spaces,<br/>whose curvatures are naturally defined as measures.  The<br/>curvatures under consideration are those arising in the<br/>Steiner-Weyl tube formula.  For smooth spaces these quantities<br/>are curvature integrals.  For singular spaces they are the total<br/>variations of certain signed measures which may be regarded as<br/>generalized curvatures.  In all known cases these curvature<br/>measures, which are a priori defined with respect to an embedding<br/>of the singular space in Euclidean space, are in fact computable<br/>solely from the intrinsic metric structure of the space.  Our<br/>general goal is to understand and extend this phenomenon.  This<br/>problem was attacked independently by Alexandrov and by Federer<br/>in the 1950s.  Alexandrov's approach was intrinsic but limited to<br/>2 dimensions, while Federer's theory dealt with embedded objects<br/>of general dimension.  Further progress will depend on the<br/>reconciliation of these two methods.  We propose that the<br/>technical key is based on the use of the geometric measure theory<br/>of currents.  The starting point is the fact that Federer's<br/>theory may be recast in the following terms: to certain singular<br/>subspaces X in euclidean space there is an associated integral<br/>current N(X) in the sphere bundle of the ambient space.  This<br/>current satisfies the Legendre condition (i.e.  it annihilates<br/>the differential ideal generated by the canonical 1-form) and is<br/>determined by its relation with the Morse theory of X. The<br/>curvature measures of X are then computable in a canonical way<br/>from N(X).  Our proposal is based on recent work of the proposer<br/>using the current theoretic framework, showing that Alexandrov's<br/>theory may be understood in similar terms.  This suggests the<br/>possibility of generalizing the intrinsic approach to higher<br/>dimensions.<br/><br/>In ordinary terms, this project aims to develop a mathematical<br/>language adequate to describe geometrical forms we encounter<br/>every day: for example, the crumplings of a sheet of paper or the<br/>surface of a rock.  Even though geometrical shapes typically<br/>found in nature tend to be rough (""singular""), for technical<br/>reasons geometry as it has developed historically restricts its<br/>attention to smooth objects.  Our goal is to be able to deal<br/>mathematically with such objects without imposing such<br/>unrealistic assumptions.  We expect that this work will<br/>eventually have a technological impact, in such areas as computer<br/>visualization and the study of buckling of sheets (as of a car<br/>fender during a collision).<br/>"

The P.I. will continue his study of finite dimensional approximations to path integral formulas on path and loop spaces over compact Riemannian manifolds.  It is hoped that these approximations will lead to: 1) a rigorous interpretation of the heuristic path integral proofs of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem, 2) construction of Brownian motions on path and loop spaces, 3) construction of non-trivial harmonic differential forms on loop groups, and 4) construction of Dirac operators on loop spaces.  These goals are consistent with the principal investigators ongoing project to understand index theorems and the Hodge -- de Rham theorem for loop spaces.  It is also proposed to try to generalize a result (related to the Segal Bargmann transform) of L. Gross and the P.I. from complex finite dimensional groups to complex loop groups.<br/><br/> Spaces of loops naturally arise in the mathematical study of surfaces and of higher dimensional manifolds.  For example, if there is a loop on a surface that can not be deformed to a point without tearing the loop apart, then the surface must contain a ""hole."" (Think of the surface of a doughnut versus the surface of a sphere.)  The physicists' string theory description of the fundamental particles of nature also use loops or ""strings.""  The quantum mechanical treatment of string theory leads to problems similar to those proposed for study by the P.I.  This proposal is devoted to answering basic mathematical questions about the (Feynman) path integral formulation of quantum mechanics on both finite dimensional curved surfaces and on the loops on such surfaces.  As a by-product of this research, the P.I. hopes to make rigorous the very beautiful physics argument for the so-called Atiyah-Singer Index theorem.  This index theorem is arguably one of the most striking mathematical developments of this century and it has had far reaching implications in both mathematics and in physics.<br/>"

Friedman<br/><br/>Abstract:<br/>This project involves the study of holomorphic G-bundles over an elliptic curve, where G is a reductive algebraic group, together with various generalizations. If G is the complexification of a compact group K, a closely related question is the classification of two commuting elements in K up to simultaneous conjugation. In joint work with J. Morgan and E. Witten, Friedman has classified holomorphic G-bundles over an elliptic curve. The relative situation for G-bundles over an elliptic fibration has also been studied. The next stage of the project is to work out the relation between these constructions, in the case where G is one of the exceptional groups E6, E7, E8, and corresponding families of K3 or del Pezzo surfaces. In terms of families of commuting elements in compact Lie groups, in joint work with A. Borel and J. Morgan, Friedman has given normal forms for commuting pairs and triples, and the method extends in principle to handle N mutually commuting elements.  <br/><br/>Compact Lie groups are the symmetry groups of nature, and the possible such groups have been classified and understood for one hundred years. Aside from four infinite series of such groups, there are also a small number of exceptional groups. Recently, such groups have become important in particle physics, because the possible subatomic particles and their interactions seem to be described by such symmetry groups. In particular string theory, which is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with gravity, has suggested that the universe is 10-dimensional and that the symmetry group involved is one of the exceptional groups. Moreover, in some versions of string theory, the missing 6 dimensions of the universe are accounted for by a so-called elliptic fibration. Thus, the project attempts to study a part of mathematics which is relevant to string theory as well as being an interesting piece of mathematics in its own right.  <br/>"

The first problem is to characterize scaling limits of rather general systems of random curves.  One aspect of the problem is to determine the regularity and dimension of a given (not necessarily random) curve without actually parametrizing it. Moreover, a sequence of scaling exponents which are relevant for regularity and tightness will be studied. The second problem is concerned specifically with random spanning trees in two dimensions. Precise conjectures exist regarding the values of the exponents in a number of examples. The object is to confirm or contradict those predictions, especially for the first three non-trivial exponents. A related question is whether the scaling limits of two standard examples, called the Minimal (Random) Spanning Tree, and the Uniformly Random Spanning Tree, differ or coincide in the limit. Moreover, existing methods should be extended to cover a class of tree processes on random graphs which has natural conformal invariance properties. Work on these questions will be part of a continuing collaboration.  The third problem is to try to establish any non-trivial bound on the dimension of self-avoiding random walks, adapting techniques that were successful for random spanning trees  and loop-erased walks. Finally, the investigator will participate in a collaborative effort aimed at understanding the connecting curves in high-dimensional critical percolation. <br/><br/>Random curves provide some of the most natural examples of fractal sets. They appear in random spanning trees (where every pair of points is connected by a unique curve), in critical percolation clusters (where two points are in the same cluster, if they are joined by a path along occupied bonds), as random walks, and as interfaces between random subsets of the plane (such as the Frontier of Brownian Motion, or level sets of random functions). These systems of random curves are typically constructed on a fine lattice within some box of finite size. Simulations suggest that in many models of interest, a meaningful continuum limit emerges as the lattice spacing is taken to zero. It is widely believed that these limits have remarkable symmetry properties, and that they should admit simple descriptions. However, there are only partial results guaranteeing that such limits even exist, and many questions about their properties remain open. <br/>"

We have discovered an operator ""delta"" in the cell structure of the space of closed curves in a manifold (string space), which records how finite collections of strings interact with themselves and with each other.  This operator induces a Lie bialgebra structure on the homology of the space of the locally embedded strings.

The motion of these media is closely related to the way curves in space twist and curl under the influence of physical forces.  Also, the interactions of the basic structure ""delta"" alluded to above, can be readily seen in such phenomena as the recoupling of vertex trails behind the wing tips of airplanes.  We have some optimism that some of our goals can be realized because the mathematical structure of closed curves seems very well adapted geometrically to many of the problems we care about on the one hand, and on the other hand once revealed this structure seems to flow forth rather willingly and with some pageantry and richness. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

One of these problems is concerned with the<br/>geometric structure of the leaves of a lamination. Some natural<br/>questions that the proposer intends to study are: what do the leaves<br/>of a lamination look like? how many different leaves<br/>(e.g. quasi-isometry classes) are there? what geometric invariants can<br/>be (and cannot be) used to distinguish them? Still concerned with the<br/>geometry of the leaves, there are questions about two dimensional<br/>laminations and metric  uniformization of their leaves. Especially<br/>interesting are those which have a Euclidean conformal structure,<br/>which are often encountered in problems of low dimensional topology<br/>and geometric group theory. Other part of this project falls in the<br/>area of rigidity of virtual subgroups of  semisimple groups and<br/>harmonic analysis on them. Research in this area has been concerned<br/>with virtual subgroups which have an invariant measure. The proposer<br/>seeks to develop the study of harmonic measures, which are non<br/>invariant in a reasonable way, and how they fit in the existing body<br/>of work on rigidity. Other part of the project concerns the study that<br/>certain geometric properties of the leaves of a foliation have on its<br/>transverse or dynamical structure and on the topological structure of<br/>the ambient manifold.<br/><br/><br/>The research of the proposer is in the general area of qualitative<br/>structure and behavior of dynamical systems. Dynamical systems are<br/>used to model processes in many areas, for example the evolution of<br/>living organisms and their morphology, the weather or other physical<br/>or chemical processes. Other systems of interest come from processes<br/>which evolve from a finite amount of data according to some set of<br/>rules, either specified before hand or of a random nature.

By thinking of discrete groups -- such as fundamental groups of compact manifolds -- in terms of their Cayley graphs, one can view them  as geometric objects in their own right.  This viewpoint, which is present throughout the proposal, leads to  some remarkable insights (Mostow rigidity, Stallings' theorem, Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, etc.) and to the striking fact that many discrete groups (for example word  hyperbolic groups) act in a canonical way on a ``boundary''.  The first part of the proposed research focusses on biLipschitz maps.  A byproduct of the project, if it is successful, will be an answer to the question of when certain aperiodic tilings of the plane (for example,  Penrose tilings) are weakly combinatorially equivalent to the usual square tiling, in the sense that one can  match the tiles of the two tilings so that adjacent tiles are matched with nearby tiles.  The second project addresses  Solv, the only 3-dimensional  Thurston geometry that remains mysterious from a large-scale viewpoint. The  remaining topics concern important issues in the fields of  nonpositively curved spaces (the dynamics of the geodesic flow and the structure of the fundamental group), hyperbolic groups (the topology of the boundary and its relation to group structure),  and Poincare duality groups (the relation between Haken PD(3)  groups and 3-manifold groups).  <br/><br/>The proposal has two main themes: symmetry,  classification, and recognition of tiling patterns; and dynamics.  Tilings of the plane and 3-space have been studied intensely for centuries, and the resulting theory is fundamental in many branches of mathematics, as well as in solid state physics (crystal structure).  In the 1970's, mathematicians discovered striking new applications of tilings (especially tilings of hyperbolic space, the geometry underlying a number  of Escher's images),  by using the ``rough'' pattern of the tilings rather than the precise shape of the tiles and their intersection pattern. >From this new viewpoint  two tilings would be considered ""roughly the same"" if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the tiles of one tiling with the tiles of the other so that adjacent tiles in one tiling correspond to nearby tiles in the other.  This is a very active area of research with connections to many areas of mathematics.  Several of the proposed research topics  relate to this: for example it is an open problem if the  tilings associated with quasi-crystal structure are always roughly the same as classical crystal tilings. Another theme in the proposal is geodesic motion -- the  motion of a free particle --  in a certain class of  spaces.  These systems have a long history and provide especially simple examples of  ``chaotic'' mechanical systems; they can also be used to model a system of several billiard balls on a billiard table with circular (or convex) bumpers. The objective here is to describe and classify, at least in  certain classes of examples, all possible trajectories of the system.    <br/>"

Through a correspondence  between Beltrami fields and the Reeb dynamics of contact  structures, one can import techniques from contact topology  and pseudoholomorphic curve theory to answer questions of  existence of solutions and of forced recurrence. In addition,  knot-theoretic techniques shed light on the global properties  of the Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. Goals of this project include the resolution of the Weinstein Conjecture on solid tori (which would imply that steady force-free fields in a tokamak have closed field lines), the spectrum of knot types which can/must appear as closed flowlines in steady Euler flows, and the implications of the tight/overtwisted  dichotomy in the hydrodynamical context with respect to  hydrodynamic instability and energy minimization.   <br/><br/>One of the enduring challenges in science is the comprehension  and taming of fluid behavior: from tornadoes to ocean currents,  we live in a world of complicated fluid dynamics.  All of these phenomena have mathematical manifestations ---  projections onto a simplified abstract setting whose  analysis yields clues to the workings of the physical world. This project will focus on the equations governing ``perfect'' fluids: models appropriate for certain non-viscous  fluids and plasmas alike. Emerging techniques from global  geometry and topology provide tools for attacking problems heretofore beyond the reach of analysis. Surprisingly, such  seemingly unrelated questions as ``How do strings tie up  into different knots'' and ``What does geometry in four  dimensions look like'' are closely tied to questions of  recurrence and stability in steady fluid flows. <br/>"

But we can consider the collection<br/>of all possible scenarios that would end up with the current<br/>structure of our DNA. This collection is the moduli space of<br/>Riemann surfaces. Deeper analysis of the collection of all<br/>possible past of our genes through studying the moduli spaces is<br/>expected to lead us to a better understanding of molecular<br/>evolution of DNA.

Comparing to the<br/>method using the paramatrix of the Szego kernel of the unit<br/>circle bundle, our method is more straightforward.  We wish to<br/>have some uniform estimates.

This<br/>can be considered an aspect of geometric group theory and is<br/>partially motivated by some questions of Gromov. The other theme,<br/>involving Kleiner and Sharafutdinov as coauthors (on different<br/>aspects), is the study of rigidity theorems (i.e. metric<br/>uniqueness) on compact manifolds.  Here for example we consider<br/>isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same<br/>spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or<br/>lengths of closed geodesics) be isometric.  This also includes<br/>questions about metric rigidity induced by conjugacy of geodesic<br/>flows, as well as inverse scattering problems.<br/><br/>The second theme of the project concerns the question of whether<br/>a space can be determined by a certain set of data.  One part of<br/>this relates to questions of remote sensing.  For example: can<br/>you determine the density of an object (say a persons body or the<br/>moon) from measurements taken ""from the outside""?  The CAT scan<br/>is a practical example where one determines the mass density of<br/>an object from measurements of the total mass along straight<br/>lines.

The first theme of this project<br/>concerns a class of infinite groups which are symmetries of<br/>Hadamard spaces H (which include spaces of nonpositive<br/>curvature.)  As such they induce symmetries on a natural<br/>boundary, B, of H.  Bruce Kleiner and the PI have found an<br/>unexpected relationship between the action of the group on B and<br/>the geometry of H.  It had been suspected that in this setting<br/>that the action on B would be determined only by the nature of<br/>the group (as is the case in the related setting of hyperbolic<br/>groups acting on negatively curved spaces).

The computational focus will be an explicit<br/>definition of algebraic varieties via differential equations; by<br/>running the program through several classes of examples, which<br/>used to be unfeasible manually, conjectures will be tested and<br/>properties sought to characterize unknown features of these<br/>spectral varieties.  Applications of technology to fields such as<br/>algebraic geometry has attracted great recent interest, including<br/>programs like ""Symbolic Computation in Geometry and Analysis"" at<br/>MSRI (Fall 1998).  This project will produce MAPLE packages which<br/>will be made publicly available to other researchers.<br/>"

In the recent work of Minahan, Nemeschansky, Vafa and<br/>Warner, they had predicted a certain family of beautiful power<br/>series encoding the numbers of singular irreducible holomorphic<br/>curves on a rational elliptic surface.

The research project<br/>is aiming at studying the relationship between their formulas and<br/>the geometric universal formula regarding the reducible<br/>holomorphic curves on the same rational elliptic surface.  To<br/>fully understand their deep relationship, one has to study the<br/>excess contributions of the multiple coverings of certain<br/>holomorphic curves in the universal formula.

The last ten years<br/>have been a blooming period that these magic ideas and<br/>predictions in modern physics change the way mathematicians<br/>think.

Gieseker and Huazhang Luo<br/><br/>In Geometric Invariant Theory, in order to study the moduli<br/>problems, the notion of stability for any polarized projective<br/>variety is introduced. However to check the stability is usually<br/>a difficult problem.  It has been done by Mumford for curves with<br/>genus bigger than 1, by Gieseker for surfaces of general type,<br/>and by Viehweg for high dimensional varieties with semi-ample<br/>canonical line bundles. We will study the stability of a<br/>polarized smooth projective variety as used by Gieseker and<br/>Mumford from a differential geometric viewpoint. More<br/>specifically, we try to relate the Gieseker-Mumford stability to<br/>the existence of a special Kahler metric on the variety such that<br/>its scalar curvature is constant and its Ricci curvature<br/>satisfies some non-degenerate constraints. This metric is not<br/>Kahler-Einstein, but is closely related to Kahler-Einstein<br/>metric. One motivation for this project comes from the previous<br/>work done by Donaldson, Uhlenbeck and Yau on the relation between<br/>stability of vector bundle and the existence of Yang-Mills<br/>connection.<br/> <br/>Our project is to relate two important but different fields in<br/>mathematics together. One is the study of special metrics, which<br/>involves the study of differential equations on manifold and<br/>usually has connection to physics.  Another is the study of<br/>stability in moduli space theory which involves mainly<br/>algebra. Our approach is to establish a correspondence between<br/>these two fields, in particular to describe the meaning of<br/>stability in terms of the existence of special metrics. The<br/>advantage for doing is it will not only provide us with new<br/>insights about those special metrics, but also provide us with<br/>new technique to moduli space theory. For example, this kind of<br/>correspondence will enable us to solve some difficult<br/>mathematical questions such as checking the Gieseker-Mumford<br/>stability of some manifolds.

The basic examples are (1) The co-sphere<br/>bundle of a compact manifold, (2) The strictly pseudoconvex<br/>boundary of a complex manifold.  Any contact manifold has a<br/>distinguished algebra of pseudo-differential operators called the<br/>Heisenberg algebra.  Epstein and Melrose, building on work of<br/>Boutet de Monvel and Guillemin, identified a family of order zero<br/>projection operators in the Heisenberg algebra, generalizing the<br/>Szego projector defined on the boundary of a complex manifold.<br/>They established that if S, S' are two such projectors then the<br/>projection defined by S from the image of S' to the image of S is<br/>a Fredholm map.  Let i(S,S') denote the index of this<br/>restriction.  We call this the relative index.  By considering<br/>Heisenberg operators which act on vector bundles, many classical<br/>index problems can be re-phrased as relative index problems for<br/>pairs of generalized Szego projectors.  The main thrust of the<br/>proposed research is to obtain formulae for the relative index in<br/>terms of more classical geometric invariants, such as indices of<br/>Dirac operators and holomorphic Euler characteristics.  A general<br/>relative index formula of this type will allow Epstein and<br/>Melrose to completely settle the general case of the<br/>Atiyah-Weinstein problem, asking for a geometric formula for the<br/>index of an FIO defined by a contact diffeomorphism between two<br/>co-sphere bundles.  Beyond this the investigator plans to search<br/>for analytic invariants of contact structures.  Using an approach<br/>suggested by Lempert and an extension of the Heisenberg algebra<br/>he hopes to obtain a second formula for i(S,S'), which should be<br/>useful in studying the small embeddable deformations of the<br/>CR-structure on a strictly pseudoconvex, compact CR-manifold.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations are the principal tool for<br/>mathematical descriptions of problems in physics, chemistry,<br/>economics, etc., and it is a fundamental problem to decide how<br/>many solutions, if any, such an equation has.  In general this<br/>problem is too delicate to solve exactly, but there is a number<br/>called the Fredholm index which can estimate the number of<br/>solutions.  The main result in this subject is the ""Atiyah-Singer<br/>Index Theorem.""  The research proposed by Epstein is concerned<br/>with extending these ideas to more general classes of equations<br/>which arise in the context of ""contact manifolds,"" a natural<br/>arena for problems in mechanics and control theory.  Analytical<br/>tools are being developed which should have many applications<br/>beyond the formula for the Fredholm index.<br/>"

Circle packing was introduced by Thurston, first in the context of orbifold constructions and then in the approximation of conformal mappings.  The topic has been developed to the point that it provides a surprisingly comprehensive discrete theory that both parallels and approximates the classical theory of analytic functions, i.e., conformal mappings in two dimensions.  Developments have been driven largely by classical connections --- discrete analyticity, extremal length, harmonic measure, Riemann mappings, and so forth --- and in turn those same connections account for circle packing's utility in a variety of other topics.  In function theory, the research focuses on circle packing techniques in studies of a conjecture of Smale, conformal tilings, and construction of Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants.  In applications, circle packing provides a unique new tool for graph embedding, and particular emphasis is placed on collaborations in brain-flattening and 2-dim quenching.  Computability of circle packings is a central strength, but growing demands have placed considerable stress on the software package ""CirclePack.""  The project addresses porting and modularization issues, and investigates strategies for implementing parallel packing algorithms.<br/><br/>Many areas of science, technology, and mathematics rely in fundamental ways on combinatorial information, that is, patterns, both concrete and abstract --- crossing patterns in a twisted strand of DNA, atomic locations in a crystal, activation sites in the visual cortex.  In 2-dimensional settings such patterns are often represented as planar graphs, which then need to be presented visually.  A pleasing new approach has emerged from abstract topology.  A ""circle packing"" is a configuration of circles having a specified pattern of tangencies.  It has dual natures: ""combinatoric"" in the prescribed pattern, but ""geometric"" in the radii of the actual circles.  One should think of the circles as bringing a ""spontaneous"" geometry to what began as a purely abstract combinatorial situation.  Fortuitously, this geometry inherits key features of an important classical mathematical topic, conformal geometry, so it brings to applications over 150 years of theoretical development.  However, unlike the classical theory, circle packings are both concrete and computable.  This project involves the development and application of circle packing algorithms and display software, with particular emphasis on collaboration with an NIH project on ""brain mapping,"" on the physics of 2-dimensional quenching, and on discrete analytic function theory in mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>"

Many of problems are related to M-theory.  This theory can be considered as an extension of string theory.  It is believed that M-theory describes all interactions existing in nature.  It was conjectured recently that M-theory can be formulated as a matrix model, called M(atrix) theory.  It is clear in this approach that the geometry of physical space is non-commutative in some sense, and so it is natural to apply methods of non-commutative geometry.  This idea was used in the formulation of some projects as well as in our recent work concerning toroidal compactifications of M(atrix) theory.  Most of the other problems are related to applications of super-geometry to various problems of quantum field theory, including general problems of quantization of gauge theories and topological quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This multidisciplinary research is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Physics, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activity of the Director of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>"

This is the third in a series of international conferences on discrete and computational geometry going back to 1986. Areas to be discussed include enumerative properties of arrangements, k-sets, geometric transversal theory, the complexity of Betti number computation, a new proof of the bellows conjecture, and the recently-announced proof of the Kepler conjecture, among many others.<br/><br/>The fields of discrete (or combinatorial) geometry and of computational geometry both deal with configurations of points, lines, planes, balls, polyhedra, etc. in 2- and 3-dimensional space, as well as in higher dimensions; i.e., with fundamental questions about simple (but usually many) geometric objects. Discrete geometry seeks a basic understanding of such geometric structures, while computational geometry investigates the inherent complexity (difficulty) of algorithmic problems. Many questions in applied areas can be reduced to problems about discrete configurations of many geometric objects. Hence advances in mathematical understanding of the geometric structures and in computational methods for dealing with them can have significant consequences for applications. Such applications arise, for example, in computer aided design and manufacturing, solid modeling, textile layout, medical imaging, computer vision, optimization, computer graphics and virtual reality, robot motion planning, geographic information systems, and molecular biology."
