In particular they will complete their determination of the projective rigidity of rational homogeneous varieties, study questions regarding invariant differential operators (e.g., what is the image of the Killing operator on a Riemannian manifold?), and further the connections between Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) resolutions and EDS. Robles will will identify necessary and sufficient conditions on curvature for the metric on a Riemannian 4-manifold to admit orthogonal coordinates, and determine geometric representatives of homology classes in Riemannian manifolds. Landsberg will work on problems originating in complexity theory and signal processing, in particular determining equations for secant varieties of homogeneous varieties, and establishing properties of the Mulmuley-Sohoni varieties associated to the determinant and permanant.<br/><br/>Differential geometry may be thought of as the study of geometric objects ""under a microscope"" (i.e., infinitesimally). Landsberg and Robles are especially interested in geometric objects with symmetry. Over the last 40 years significant advances have been made in representation theory, which systematically studies symmetry (e.g., the BGG machinery), and these advances will be applied by the PIs to establish properties of systems of partial differential equations arising in differential geometry.  Individually, the PIs will use also use differential geometry and representation theory to work on problems in topology (Robles), in theoretical computer science (Landsberg and Robles) and signal processing (Landsberg)."

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

Alesker on convex valuations.  Alesker has shown that the space of valuations is subject to a a range of natural algebraic operations, including a commutative multiplication. Furthermore the restriction to the convex setting turns out to be unnatural, and Alesker has introduced a theory of valuations on general smooth manifolds M, with a certain class of singular subspaces of M replacing the convex bodies. From this perspective the classical work of Blaschke, Chern, Federer et al. may be viewed as the trivial ground case, corresponding to the full rotation group SO(n), of a more general theory applying to smaller groups that act transitively on the sphere. The project will pursue these ideas in a few different contexts, specifically (real) hyperbolic spaces and complex space forms. In a different direction, the theory of valuations opens up a new and seemingly very natural approach to the geometry of Finsler manifolds. Yet another aspect of the project addresses the question of which singular subspaces X are truly natural for the theory of valuations. A formal answer is provided by earlier work of the PI--- X must admit a ``normal cycle""--- but this condition is itself very poorly understood. Finally, the style of analysis arising in these last questions appears to have an infinite-dimensional analogue in the ``ropelength problem."" Work to date in this direction has involved only the first order theory, while the more fruitful second order aspects have not yet been made their appearance in this infinite-dimensional world.<br/><br/>The classical formula of Poincare states that if two curves are placed at random on a sphere then, on average, the number of points of intersection is proportional to the product of their lengths. This formula is just one of an array of similar formulas expressing natural probabilistic measurements in terms of the geometric characteristics of the objects involved. It turns out that these measurements are themselves subject to a kind of algebra, which is linked in mysterious ways to the underlying geometry. We will explore these issues in a variety of contexts."

The focus topics are the following. For SLS 2010: ""Minimal Surfaces and Mean Curvature Flow.""  The conference will take place April 15-17, 2010. The principal speaker will be Professor William Minicozzi from Johns Hopkins University. There will be additional one-hour talks by ten invited speakers to be chosen by Professor Minicozzi, and several twenty-minute contributed talks by graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. Professor Minicozzi will address recent progress on the study of minimal surfaces and mean curvature flow. In particular, he will speak about sharp partial regularity theorems for weak solutions of the mean curvature flow and other instances of  the increased understanding of geometric flows that have accompanied recent dramatic progress on Ricci flow. Many of the tools of regularity theory that were originally invented for minimal surfaces have been widely applied to other geometric problems. In the case of mean curvature flow, this includes the monotonicity formula of Huisken, Brian White's parabolic version of Federer's dimension reducing, and Brakke's regularity theorem (which is a parabolic version of Allard's theorem for stationary varifolds). For SLS 2011: ""Conformal Differential Geometry and Its Interaction with Representation Theory."" The conference will take place April 7-9, 2011, and feature principal speaker Professor Michael Eastwood of the University of Adelaide. There will be additional one-hour talks by ten invited speakers to be chosen by Professor Eastwood, and several twenty-minute contributed talks by graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. Professor Eastwood's talks will address the interplay between conformal differential geometry and Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) machinery. The conformal case, important in itself, also acts as an excellent testbed for the more general theory of parabolic geometry. In particular, these talks will set the scene for a conjectured vast extension of the BGG machinery and a properly geometric theory of prolongation. Branson's Q-curvature and its prescription problem will be discussed in this context. Recent work of Oshima finds the symmetry algebras of all conformally invariant differential operators on the flat model. These lectures will discuss the curved cases, which are completely open at present. Finally, the BGG machinery can be used with complex analysis to solve reconstruction problems for integral geometry on suitable homogeneous spaces. The talks will present the current research and outlook in this direction.<br/><br/>Mathematics conferences are vital to the development of the field. They provide unique opportunity for scientists from different subfields to meet so as to (a) summarize the most recent progress in these fields, and their interactions, (b) present new directions of research with sufficient detail to formulate and develop a list of open problems, and (c) provide an opportunity to foster new collaborations and exchange ideas toward the solution of important open questions. In the tradition of the Arkansas Spring Lectures Series, these meetings will provide unique opportunities for young researchers and graduate students to interact with prominent experts in their research areas. Public talks by Professor Daniel Rockmore (Dartmouth College) in 2010 and by Professor Eastwood (Adelaide) in 2011 will address audiences of high school students and the public at large."

Parker<br/><br/>This project involves analytic aspects of the theory of pseudo-<br/>holomorphic and harmonic maps.  The PI's recent work with Junho<br/>Lee has established a remarkable link between Gromov-Witten<br/>theory in dimensions 2 and 4.  The first project aims to complete<br/>this program (with Lee) by explicitly calculating the local GW<br/>invariants that determine the GW invariants of a wide class of<br/>Kahler surfaces.  The planned technique, a homotopy of operators<br/>together with the symplectic sum formula, should be useful in<br/>other contexts.  GW is especially effective in making predictions<br/>about Calabi-Yau 3-folds.  The second proposed project seeks to<br/>use geometric analysis methods to prove the Gompakumar-Vafa<br/>Conjecture, which is a fascinating prediction by physicists that<br/>the plethora of GW numbers are determined by a more limited<br/>collection of ""BPS numbers"".  In a third project, the PI and<br/>J. Lee aim to prove that, under certain hypotheses, the space of<br/>stable $J$-holomorphic maps is generically a smooth manifold, a<br/>long-sought result.  Finally, Project 4 is a study of the<br/>finite-time singularities of the harmonic map heat flow.  The<br/>idea is to use analysis on path space to show that the maps<br/>develop ""necks"" whose images converge to geodesics in a precise<br/>manner.<br/><br/>One of the most notable developments in recent mathematics has<br/>been the remarkable confluence of ideas coming from string<br/>theory, algebraic geometry, and symplectic geometry.  A major<br/>part of the story revolves around the idea of counting<br/>holomorphic curves in algebraic manifolds (this is a geometric<br/>formulation of one of the most fundamental programs in<br/>mathematics: classifying the solutions of systems of polynomial<br/>equations).  The counting problem was studied for 100 years with<br/>few results. Then, around 1990, it was realized that the problem<br/>can be translated into symplectic geometry and tackled using the<br/>machinery of mathematical Gauge Theory, a theory that arose from<br/>interactions between mathematics and physics.  This<br/>""Gromov-Witten invariant"" approach quickly led to formulas<br/>answering some of the original curve-counting problems.  This<br/>project is aimed at further developing Gromov-Witten theory using<br/>the methods of geometric analysis, and applying similar<br/>techniques to related problems in the theory of harmonic maps."

Further implications of obstructions to the existence of Einstein metrics on  smooth manifolds are expected. The other part the proposal addresses the study of Kahler structures. The project proposed on the classification of Ricci flat asymptotically locally euclidean Kahler manifolds (non-hyperkahler) establishes a starting point in the study of the compactification of the moduli space  of constant scalar curvature Kahler manifolds.  The specific tools used come from twistor spaces, geometric analysis, algebraic geometric stability, and Seiberg-Witten theory.<br/><br/>In spite of the tremendous developments over the last twenty years, there is still  a lot that eludes us about the geometry of manifolds in low dimensions. The  proposed research aims to develop interactions between  different geometric structures such as Riemannian geometry, differential topology and Kahler geometry on four dimensional spaces. The PI plans to approach classification problems of special geometries (ALE Ricci flat Kahler), and also to understand existence and non-existence of Einstein or constant scalar curvature Kahler geometric structures on 4-manifolds, or 4-manifolds with singularities.  These topics are of great importance not only in differential and algebraic geometry, but also in mathematical physics (string theory)."

Noncommutative geometry aims to study geometric properties of a new class of ""spaces"" whose algebras of functions are no longer commutative. The central idea goes back to quantum mechanics, in which observables such as position and momentum do not commute. The subject has undergone tremendous exploration recently due to its close connection to a number of areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, including foliation theory, index theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, quantum field theory, quantization theory, and string theory. <br/><br/>The project consists in a pair of summer schools (GAP VIII and GAP XI) aimed at gathering different streams and instances of noncommutative geometry, as well as identifying new emerging directions. The main purposes of the proposed activities are to bring together leading experts and young researchers working in rapidly developing subjects, and to promote interaction between mathematicians and physicists, and groups working on different aspects of related areas so as to foster interaction, encourage cross-fertilization between different fields, and promote the dissemination of the most recent results of current research. There are many talented young people working in this area. GAP VIII and GAP XI will provide them with excellent opportunities to disseminate their ideas and to broaden their perspective. The PIs anticipate inviting a substantial number of mathematicians at the postdoctoral and graduate student level (from Europe, the United States, and developing countries), and holding poster or short-talk sessions through which young researchers will be given the chance to present their work. The schools will provide an excellent opportunity for young American scientists to exchange ideas with their European peers and initiate collaborations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis Program, the Algebra and Number Theory Program, and the Analysis Program."

Such techniques have been particularly useful for studying manifolds with bounds on sectional or Ricci curvature, but a new weaker notion of convergence is needed to understand manifolds without such strong conditions.  Recently the PI and Dr. Wenger have applied work of Drs. Ambrosio and Kirchheim to introduce a new distance between manifolds: the intrinsic flat distance.  While the convergence is weaker than previous forms of convergence, the limit spaces, called Integral Current Spaces, are countably H^mrectifiable. Applying work of Cheeger-Colding, Gromov and Perelman, the PI and Dr. Wenger have shown that the Gromov-Hausdorff and intrinsic flat limits of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature agree.  However, in general the limit spaces are different and sequences which do not converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense may still converge in the intrinsic flat sense.  The PI will study the properties of these limit spaces under a variety of conditions on the sequence of manifolds and prove stability theorems under these weaker conditions.  In particular the PI proposes to improve her results on the stability of the Friedmann model.<br/><br/>The spacelike universe is described in Friedmann cosmology as an isotropic three dimensional Riemannian manifold that expands in time starting from the initial Big Bang.  In reality the universe is not isotropic because it is bent by gravity in a nonuniform way. Weak gravitational lensing (due to dust) and strong gravitational lensing (due to massive objects) has been observed by the Hubble to distort regions of space. The universe is thus, at best, close to the Friedmann model in some sense. In prior work, under strong assumptions, the PI has shown that a Riemannian manifold which is almost isotropic (in a way which allows for weak gravitational lensing and localized strong gravitational lensing) is close to the Friedmann model in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.  This is proven by studying the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of increasingly isotropic manifolds.  Now the PI proposes to prove that under weaker assumptions, the universe is close to the Friedmann model in the intrinsic flat sense by studying the intrinsic flat limits of Riemannian manifolds.  Using the intrinsic flat distance will not only allow for weak and strong gravitational lensing but also allow for the possible existence of wormholes.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------"

L-infinity variational problems study the minimization problem of appropriate cost functionals that are suprema of integrand functions. The area has become very active recently. Particular foci of the first part of the project are the following: to identify the most general conditions guaranteeing that the equivalence relationship between absolute minimizers of quasi-convex Hamiltonian functionals and viscosity solutions to the highly degenerate Aronsson equation holds; to explore uniqueness issues for general Aronsson equations with spatial dependence; to study the homogenization problem for L-infinity variational problems in the framework of gamma convergence; and to investigate L-infinity variational problems under Dirichlet energy constraints.The second part of this project deals with the Ericksen-Leslie system modeling hydrodynamic flows of nematic liquid crystals. This is a strongly coupled system relating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation of the underlying fluid velocity field and the transported heat flow of harmonic maps for the director field of the nematic liquid crystal materials. The objective is to establish both existence and partial regularity for Leray-Hopf-type weak solutions in dimension three.<br/><br/>The proposed problems not only are mathematically important but also have potential applications to other fields of mathematics, applied science, and materials engineering. The nonlinear partial differential equations or systems involved in the project either are highly degenerate elliptic problems or  equations with super-critical nonlinearities whose resolutions will definitely contribute new ideas and techniques that will be useful in a variety of contexts. So-called L-infinity variational problems arise in a number of different areas such as the determination of optimal radiation treatments in chemotherapy, image analysis and recovery engineering, and the design of winning strategies in certain types of random games. In mechanical engineering, the Ericksen-Leslie system is among the most fundamental equations used to describe the dynamics of viscoelastic fluids, including nematic liquid crystals. Rigorous analysis of both the existence and the regularity of various solutions to such a system can predict the formation of singularities, allow researchers to gain insight into turbulent phenomena, and justify both computational and experimental studies made by applied scientists and engineers. This project will result in the publication of monographs and lecture notes, involve active training of advanced graduate students, and include the organization of specific conferences or workshops."

Using analysis as its main tool and differential geometry, topology and algebraic geometry as foundations, it has solved a large number of problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and mathematical physics.  There is much enthusiasm for its continuation among geometers, analysts and mathematicians of related fields at institutions from the southern California, as well as young geometric analysts cross the country. It is the unique annual meeting of its kind in the Southern California area, and continues to foster interest in geometric analysis at all levels.<br/><br/>The goal of this Seminar is to promote interaction among mathematicians in Southern California who are interested in geometric analysis and related areas and to introduce graduate students and post-docs to some of the best works in geometric analysis.  The SCGAS has become an important and anticipated event for the Southern California region, as the success of the first sixteen meetings has demonstrated. In fact the SCGAS also attracts a substantial number of participants from all over the country.  The Seminar, organized jointly by UC-San Diego and UC-Irvine, will continue its commitment to encourage and support participation of graduate students and recent PhDs, especially young women and minority mathematicians, and will continue to invite top women mathematicians as speakers.

Since the ancient solutions occur as singularity models of finite time singularities, the proposer suggests to study the properties and the classification of those in the case of different flows. One special case of ancient solutions are the gradient shrinking solitons. There is much to be understood about their geometric properties especially in the complete higher dimensional  cases which can help the classification of those. Related to the singularities I the proposer also suggests studying the optimal conditions under which one can guarantee the existence of a smooth solution to e.g. the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow.<br/><br/><br/>The proposer is interested in studying different parabolic geometric flows since their parabolic properties tend to improve the properties of the initial geometric objects. For example, under certain conditions on the initial metric the Ricci flow tends to exist forever and converges to a metric of constant sectional curvature which tells us a lot about the topology of our manifold. That means one can sometimes use the parabolic geometric flows in order to resolve some issues in other mathematical fields. Ancient solutions are the solutions that come from all the way from negative infinity. The physicists are interested in understanding those solutions to the Ricci flow.  <br/><br/><br/>"

The SL(2,C)-character variety, X(F), of a group F parametrizes conjugacy classes of representations of F into SL(2,C), the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space. Discrete faithful elements of X(F) correspond to hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the PI will work to understand better the interaction between topological and geometric features of these manifolds, as well as the structure of the discrete-faithful locus itself. In addition, he will pursue a study of X(F) as a whole, considered as a dynamical system under the action of the outer automorphism group of F (particularly when F is a free group). A new dynamical decomposition of X(F) was recently discovered, whose structure seems to be rich and relatively unexplored. In addition the PI will study geometric aspects of Teichmuller spaces, which parametrize hyperbolic structures in two dimensions, and of Mapping Class Groups, their natural automorphism groups.<br/><br/>The interactions between geometry, topology and dynamics play a entral role in mathematics as well as its applications. A geometric space, such as our own universe or the configuration space of some system, may admit dynamical phenomena such as flows, iterations or group actions. The behavior of these phenomena, as well as the geometry of the space, can be strongly influenced by its topological structure, namely the underlying connective tissue on which the geometry is overlaid. Furthermore, we often find that geometry and dynamics persist at higher levels of abstraction: the collection of all geometric structures on a given space can itself be organized into a new ""higher"" space, with its own geometry and its own inherent symmetries which give rise to dynamical structure. The interaction between these phenomena at different levels can enrich our insight about the original systems. The PI's own research focuses on particular instances of this general template, namely the geometry and topology of 2- and 3- dimensional spaces, and the corresponding dynamics for their higher parameter spaces. This low-dimensional setting is particularly amenable to our intuition and is partly motivated by direct visual analogies with our physical world, but it also happens, for a variety of reasons, to be a meeting place for a number of different areas of mathematics as well as physics, so that a fuller understanding in this domain can enrich, by analogy as well as direct mathematical connection, our approaches to other parts of mathematics.

Wentworth<br/><br/><br/>The grant addresses several research projects in  geometric analysis.  The first part continues work on the Yang-Mills flow on higher dimensional Kaehler manifolds.  A special focus is a comparison of the analytic singularities that occur along the flow with the algebraic singularities associated to Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of holomorphic vector bundles.  The second project analyzes the topology of moduli spaces of coherent systems on Riemann surfaces.   Coherent systems are related to a variety of geometric objects such as higher rank Brill-Noether loci and holomorphic maps to Grassmannians and other homogeneous varieties.  New methods of Morse theory in the setting of singular spaces provide a framework for these computations.  An ongoing  project  studies energy minimizing maps to the Weil-Petersson completion of Teichmueller space.  Such maps are associated to homomorphisms of fundamental groups of Riemannian manifolds to the mapping class group of a compact oriented surface.  Regularity of harmonic maps is the main issue, as this is related to rigidity questions.   The fourth project consists of further topics related to representation varieties of surface groups.  The PI will continue to investigate the functional on Teichmueller space  defined by the energy of equivariant harmonic maps associated to surface group representations.  A particular aim will be to develop new criteria for the properness and uniqueness of minima of this functional. Results  will have implications for the dynamics of the mapping class group action on the moduli space of representations.  Representations into the isometry group of the complex ball are related to spherical CR-structures, and there are many open questions as to how these relate to hyperbolic structures. The project also proposes to establish new existence and rigidity results.  <br/><br/>A significant branch of mathematical inquiry has been the relationship between the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties of manifolds. Manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of curves and surfaces, and they appear in a variety of situations in pure and applied mathematics. Symmetries are also a natural and fundamental part of physical systems, and the dynamics of these symmetries carries important information.  The research projects in this proposal will further our understanding of some of these objects. The equations studied -- energy minimizing maps and the Yang-Mills flow -- have their origins in the mathematical description of the physical world and are therefore are of great importance to both mathematicians and physicists. <br/><br/><br/>"

The description gives a short proof of the Masur-Wolf result determining the full symmetry group of the polyhedron. The investigator has provided detailed information on the geometry near the faces.

This turns out to be closely related to hyperbolic geometry, where Fuchsian and Kleinian groups are groups of isometries of hyperbolic two and three dimensional spaces.

Within the general field of geometric analysis, the conference will focus on microlocal analysis, spectral geometry, conformal invariants, analysis on non-compact manifolds including the study of index theory and de Rham cohomologies as well as wave propagation, and the study of geometric flows. These topics are chosen because of many recent advances and numerous open frontiers, and because in spite of many connections between them, there is sufficient distance between these topics that collaborative projects, benefitting from different points of view, are particularly fruitful. In particular, the conference is expected to facilitate productive interactions between researchers working on elliptic and parabolic (which are the traditional strengths of the field), respectively hyperbolic (such as wave propagation), problems in partial differential equations. The proposal serves to provide for the transportation to the conference, and accomodation there, for some participants, with emphasis on graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty from US universities.<br/><br/>Geometric analysis covers areas in which one studies phenomena, such as wave propagation or heat flow, on geometric backgrounds. One example of such a geometric background is general relativity, giving rise to a curved space-time of great physical interest. It also gives rise to `static' problems, without a `time' variable; the latter have received much of the attention as they are analytically more tractable. While often there is a physical motivation, recent work in the Ricci flow, which is an analogue of heat flow, shows that the field can also be used to answer questions of mathematical origin, in this case in topology (the study of shapes). This conference combines both aspects, and strives to encourage collaboration between researchers in different areas. It is also designed be ideal for doctoral students and young researchers as it will provide them with a host of techniques and problems relevant to their research. In particular, the speakers will be asked that the talks explain both the methods used and the motivations for the problem be it from a pure or an applied perspective, and there will be a discussion of new and open problems as well; this is expected to help young researchers just starting work in the field."

This project focuses on the moduli space of complex projective Riemann surfaces, a class of geometric objects that encode information about $3$-dimensional spaces (hyperbolic manifolds) in $2$-dimensional form.  Through both theoretical study and computational experiments, the PI will develop new tools for analyzing these structures, enhance the connections between $2$- and $3$-dimensional geometry, and expand applications of these structures in related fields of mathematics.

We expect that a continuing investigation of this approach will lead to further advances and developments within the field of noncommutative geometry itself, by the challenge of fine tuning the available theory to fit specific number theoretic problems, while at the same time it will provide new possible approaches and different viewpoints on questions of number theoretic relevance.  This proposal has a strong educational components, with six graduate students involved in various parts of the project. A network of international contacts and collaborations will also be involved."

Stern<br/><br/>The PI's proposed research focuses on several problems related to the existence and geometry of connections minimizing the Yang-Mills and related energy functionals of connections on vector bundles over manifolds of special holonomy and on smooth projective varieties.  In the first project the PI, in joint work with Bianca Santoro, will study critical points and parabolic flows of the energy, E', given by the L2 norm of the (0,2)component of the curvature tensor. In many special geometries where the de Rham cohomology is all of type (p,p), they will attempt to prove holomorphicity of connections that are stable critical points of E'.  They will also study obstructions to the long time existence of solutions to the gradient flow for E'. The primary goal of this project is to improve our understanding of when vector bundles admit holomorphic structures. In a related project, joint with Benoit Charbonneau, the PI will use techniques from geometric quantization to study refined Hodge structures on isomorphism classes of vector bundles on smooth projective varieties. They will study the large k asymptotics of the projection operator onto the kernel of a generalized Diracoperator associated to a bundle F tensored by the kth power of a polarizing line bundle.They have used these asymptotics to define a refined Hodge filtration on bundles and will attempt to exploit the asymptotics further to prove that the Chern character mapping from bundles to de Rham cohomology (equipped with its usual Hodge structure) respects these new Hodge filtrations. Connection analogs of Donaldson's balanced metric conditions arise in this study. The PI will seek corresponding analogs of Gieseker stability.  In joint work with Savdeep Sethi, the PI will study the moduli space of instantons on RxT^3, interpolating between flat connections on T^3, with unequal Chern Simons invariants.<br/><br/>The physics of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces is based on gauge theory, the study of differential calculus on vector bundles. The primary objects in these gauge theories are connections, which may be viewed as rules for defining differentiation. The primary energy guiding the dynamics in these physical theories is the Yang-Mills energy, and the fields dominating the physics are those that minimize the Yang-Mills energy. In dimensions greater than 4, the existence and structure of these optimal connections are poorly understood. In 4-dimensions, optimal connections have been a powerful tool for answering questions in geometry and topology. In higher dimensions they can potentially provide extremely important techniques for attacking questions in differential and algebraic geometry. In particular, they may give techniques for transforming questions involving the solutions of complex partial differential equations to dramatically simpler algebraic problems. As the current theories of quantum gravity all require an understanding of physics in dimensions greater than 4, there is strong interplay between the physical and geometric study of optimal connections. In fact, the antecedents to this project arose from questions posed to the PI by physicists; the answer to these questions then led to new results in geometry."

In recent work with Davide Gaiotto and Greg Moore, the principal investigator has used techniques of supersymmetric gauge theory to attack the problem of counting stable geometric objects in Calabi-Yau threefolds.  As an application they showed that the desired counts, known as ""generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants,"" are actually imprinted into hyperkahler metrics on certain auxiliary moduli spaces.  This connection illuminates previously mysterious aspects of the counting problem; in particular it gives a new geometric understanding of the ""wall-crossing formula"" which governs how these invariants jump, i.e. how the relevant geometric objects can split and join.  At the same time, it gives a totally new way of looking at the hyperkahler metrics in question.  The proposed research builds on this recent work in various directions.  Much of the program is part of a continuing collaboration between the PI, Davide Gaiotto and Greg Moore.  First, they will apply their new construction to get more explicit information than was previously available about complete hyperkahler metrics, with the ultimate goal being a new description of the Ricci-flat metric on a K3 surface.  Second, they will explore extensions of their construction to encompass metrics on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles associated to groups other than SU(2).  Third, they will use the gauge theory perspective to study wall-crossing properties of conjectural new invariants which extend Donaldson-Thomas.  In collaboration with Sergio Cecotti and Cumrun Vafa, the PI will also look for new restrictions on the Donaldson-Thomas invariants coming from their gauge-theoretic interpretation.<br/><br/>The crowning achievement of fundamental physics over the last century was the development of ""quantum field theory"", the toolkit which physicists use to describe the behavior of subatomic particles.  Many of the methods of quantum field theory look radically different from the usual methods of mathematicians.  Nevertheless it has been gradually appreciated that many of these ideas do have applications to problems of ""pure"" mathematics: for example, questions about geometry can sometimes be rephrased as questions about subatomic physics!  In particular, recently it was discovered (by the PI together with collaborators Greg Moore and Davide Gaiotto) that by studying the behavior of certain four-dimensional and three-dimensional quantum systems at very low energies, one can get detailed information about the geometry of certain spaces (""hyperkahler spaces"") which have been intensely studied by mathematicians in recent years.  This appears to be the beginning of a much richer story: by using deeper properties of the quantum systems, the PI aims to get deeper information about the corresponding geometry.  There are numerous applications to related areas of mathematics, including the ""geometric Langlands program"" which aims to create a bridge between geometry and number theory."

Moreover, measurements of waves can be used in the identification of objects or perturbations. The latter use inspires inverse scattering theory. The project will study several such inverse problems--one is the problem of determining a set with analytic boundary in Euclidean space from  information about the scattering matrix in a very limited number of directions, and  another is the problem of determining a radial potential from its resonances. Resonances are poles of certain meromorphic functions and are, in some sense, analogous to eigenvalues. Another problem involves further understanding the distribution of resonances in Euclidean scattering. Other projects involve manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends. In particular, a goal is to improve our understanding of how the geometric structure of such manifolds is reflected in analytic objects such as the scattering matrix or the set of resonances.<br/><br/>Radar, sonar, and medical imaging provide examples of inverse scattering theory in practical use. Resonances are of interest to physicists and chemists, for whom a resonance corresponds to a metastable state, containing information about both the frequency and the rate of decay. The class of manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends include waveguides, which are variously used in modeling  semiconductors and the ocean.

One of the best known areas of global harmonic analysis is Quantum Chaos, which concerns the impact of ergodicity or mixing of the geodesic flow on semi-classical limits of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.  Nalini Anantharaman and I are continuing our joint work in quantum ergodicity on hyperbolic surfaces, where we are constructing an explicit intertwining operator between classical and quantum dynamics. Using the hyperbolic Poisson operator, I reduced the study of quantum limits to the ideal boundary and am studying boundary distributions of eigenfunctions. Dynamics also can be used in inverse spectral theory. Hamid Hezari and I have recently proved that any analytic domain with mirror symmetries across all axes are determined by their Dirichlet spectra. We are currently relating our results to Birkhoff normal forms. John Toth, Hans Christianson and I are also developing a new area of quantum ergodic restriction theorems, where eigenfunctions are ergodic after being restricted to hypersurfaces.   In another direction, global harmonic analysis is useful in constructing approximate solutions of the complex homogeneous Monge Ampere equations governing geodesics in the space of Kahler metrics. Rubinstein and I are using complex Fourier integral operator methods to solve the Cauchy initial value problem for geodesics.  With Shiffman and Zeitouni I am continuing also my work on random holomorphic fields on Kahler manifolds. This is another kind of asymptotic geometry where the number of zeros tends to infinity. <br/><br/><br/>Global harmonic analysis and asymptotic geometry is  the use of ideas and techniques of quantum mechanics to solve problems in geometry, analysis and mathematical physics. A famous problem is to whether one can hear the shape of a drum, i.e. tell the shape from the frequencies of vibration. One would also like to know the shapes and sizes of the modes of vibration, and the structure of the nodal sets where the drum is not moving as it vibrates. For two hundred years,  the frequencies and shapes of modes of vibration have been important in physics and engineering, both for actual drums and also for atoms and molecules. It turns out that one can learn a lot about modes of vibration by playing billiards on the drum head. By looking carefully at waves moving along bouncing ball orbits (billiard trajectories which hit the domain orthogonally at two points and endlessly bounce back and forth between these points), one can determine the entire shape of an analytic drum. Morever, when the billiards are chaotic then one can determine the patterns of nodal sets, where the drum is still as it vibrates.  My research gives rigorous proofs of these statements. <br/><br/><br/>"

The propagation of waves on smoothly varying spaces is well understood in many respects, but the interaction with singularities--which might range from boundaries, to corners, to structures ""at infinity""--presents many open problems. One of the project's components is related to the understanding of wave propagation on Kerr spacetimes (i.e., near rotating black holes). The principal investigator will study the distribution of quasi-normal modes, the ways that the black hole may ""ring"" with damped oscillations. The initial goal of this project is to obtain a rigorous description of the exponential decay rate of high frequency modes. The project also includes work on problems of local energy decay on Riemannian manifolds, for which the geometry of the infinite ends turns out to have a profound effect on the low frequency phenomena that may dominate energy decay. Another aspect of wave propagation of interest to the principal investigator is the infinite-speed propagation occurring in solutions to the Schrodinger equation. In settings in which geometric rays are trapped in a bounded region, little is known about the regularity of solutions. The principal investigator is intent on studying the effects of these trapped rays, as well as the effects of geometric singularities such as cone points on the propagation.<br/><br/>Geometry influences the behavior of solutions to wave equations in many interesting and subtle ways. Following Newton, we know that light behaves in many regimes as if made of tiny particles. On the other hand, we also know that light can turn corners (""diffract"") and that it tends to disperse. The effect of changes in geometry to changes in propagation of waves (be they light or sound or water or gravity waves, or the wave-functions describing quantum particles) is the central focus of this project's research. In particular, the principal investigator's work on quasi-normal modes for Kerr spacetimes is closely related to problems of intense interest in the physics community, as these modes are part of the signature of gravitational waves. The principal investigator's study of the linear Schrodinger equation is related to applications not just to the physics of nonrelativistic quantum particles, but also to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which models such disparate phenomena as laser pulses and superconductivity."

The proposal has several interrelated parts.  The first  concerns the groups of algebraic cycles and cocycles on a projective variety X.  <br/>The aim is to understand these groups and relate them to the global structure of X. The investigator has, with  others, established a theory of homology type for algebraic varieties  based on the  homotopy groups of cycles spaces. This  theory will be used to study concrete questions about algebraic spaces. Implications for real algebraic geometry will be explored. Striking connections to universal constructions in topology which emerged in prior research will also be investigated.  The second  part of the proposal concerns cycles which bound holomorphic chains in projective  manifolds. In particular, characterizations in terms of  projective linking numbers and quasi plurisubharmonic functions will be sought.  This will  entail a deep analysis of the structure of projective hulls, a concept analogous to polynomial hulls, which has been introduced by the investigators and is of independent interest.  Projective hulls are related to approximation theory, pluripotential theory, and the spectrum of Banach graded algebras. The third topic, an important part of the proposal,  concerns the Dirichlet problem for fully nonlinear partial differential equations on riemannian manifolds. Interesting progress  was recently made on this question and the investigation will continue with an eye to further applications.  Motivation for this study came from the investigators' development of pluripotential theory in calibrated and other geometries, where notions of plurisubharmonic  functions, pseudo-convex domains, capacity, etc. were introduced and shown to have many of the properties known in the classical complex case. With the new analytic developments, deeper questions in this field will be addressed.  This part of the project should have a major impact in calibrated geometry, which in turn plays an important role in M-theory in modern physics.  There should also be applications to symplectic geometry and to p-convexity in riemannian geometry. The final area concerns analytic approaches to differential characters and  generalizations, developed by the investigator and R. Harvey.   These objects mediate betweeen cycles and smooth data.  In the complex category this involves an analytic study of Deligne cohomology.  It yields invariants for bundles and foliations, and retrieves the classical Abel-Jacobi mappings.  This project will also be concerned with student development, including an undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering  mathematical independence and developing interactive environments.<br/><br/><br/>A concept of central importance in geometry is that of a ``cycle''.  In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the simultaneous solution of a system of polynomial equations. In differential geometry they arise in many ways: as the large scale solutions of certain differential equations, and as the level sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.  Curves and surfaces in space are simple examples.  Cycles with  a particular geometry also  play a fundamental role in modern physical theories. This proposal is concerned with the study of cycles across this broad spectrum. In the algebraic setting, cycles have been related to fundamental large-scale geometry of their surrounding  space. This discovery has revealed surprizing and important relationships between spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental constructions in algebraic topology and has led to new insights in both fields.  This work will be continued. Another area of investigation concerns cycles which form the boundary of subsets with special geometric structure.  They represent non-linear versions of classical boundary value problems in analysis. Such questions arise in many contexts.  The proposer has formulated conjectures relating important classes of such cycles to questions in approximation theory and  Banach algebras. Successful resolution will establish a series of new results  in complex geometry and should lead to significant new insights in several other fields of mathematics. A third, and very important,  part of the proposal concerns the Dirichlet problem (the prescribed boundary-value problem) for fully nonlinear partial differential equations in various geometric settings.  Interesting progress  was recently made on this question and the investigation will continue with an eye to further applications. Motivation for this study came from the investigators' extension of classical pluripotential theory to very general geometric settings.  These include calibrated geometries, symplectic  and Lagrangian geometries, and much more. An uncanny amount of the classical theory has already been shown to hold in this general context.   With the new analytic developments,  deeper questions in this field will be addressed.  This part of the study is, in a certain strict sense, dual to the study of the special cycles appearing in these geometries.  It should apply to Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, and associative and Cayley cycles in G(2) and Spin(7) spaces. These latter subjects play an important role in M-theory in modern  Physics. A forth domain of investigation concerns  a mathematical apparatus developed by the proposer and R. Harvey to detect subtle relationships between cycles and the global  structure of the space they live in.  This apparatus encompasses some of the most effective tools historically developed for this purpose, and it is much more general. Further development of this theory and its applications will be pursued. This project will also be concerned with graduate student development.Students will be part of the research team.  There will also be an undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering mathematical independence and developing interactive environments."

The first of these arises from a particularly promising definition of quasilocal mass due to Bartnik, which seeks to localize the total (or ADM) mass. Although this definition satisfies most desired properties, and thus has the potential to be very useful, its abstract and nonconstructive nature yield severe limitations on understanding and applicability. In order to rectify this problem the Static Extension Conjecture asserts that the quasilocal mass may be calculated as the ADM mass of a solution to the Static Vacuum Einstein equations which satisfies a certain geometric boundary condition. In recent joint work of the author and M. Anderson, existence for this boundary value problem has been established under a reasonable nondegeneracy assumption on the given boundary data; this development has placed the conjecture within reach. The Penrose Inequality relates the total mass of a spacetime to the area of its event horizons (boundary of black holes) via the inequality: total mass squared is greater than or equal to the total area of the event horizons divided by 16 pi. This may be viewed as a conjecture for an arbitrary spacelike slice of a spacetime, and in this setting an important special case (when the second fundamental form of the slice vanishes) has been confirmed independently by Huisken and Ilmanen (one black hole) and by Bray (finitely many black holes). In recent joint work with Bray, the author has succeeded in reducing this problem to solving a canonical system of partial differential equations, and has confirmed existence in special cases. It is a major goal of this project to complete this program by proving a general existence result, and thus establishing the Penrose Conjecture.<br/><br/>Although there are numerous proposed methods for calculating the gravitational plus matter energy content of a bounded domain (the so called quasilocal mass) in General Relativity, all seem to suffer from one affliction or another. In the case of Bartnik's mass, the sole problem is the abstract nature of its definition. If the Static Extension Conjecture were verified, this lone difficulty should be resolved, thus opening the way for several applications. For example, it is generally believed that whenever enough mass is concentrated in a sufficiently small region, gravitational collapse must ensue and result in a black hole - such a statement is often referred to as the Hoop Conjecture. While there are many ways to accurately describe the size of a region, until a proper notion of quasilocal mass is established, a rigorous and complete version of this conjecture will remain elusive. Another promising application of a properly defined notion of quasilocal mass, is to the long time existence problem for the Einstein Equations. As these equations form a hyperbolic system (after fixing the gauge), it is tempting to search for a theory based on an energy method analogous to the classical theory of the scalar wave equation. A major obstacle to realizing such an approach, is the lack of an appropriate notion of energy for the gravitational field (a constituent of quasilocal mass). Moreover the boundary value problem associated with the Static Extension Conjecture, is in fact an elliptic boundary value problem for the Ricci operator. Hence the techniques developed to study this conjecture should prove useful when investigating well-posed boundary value problems in several other settings, such as for instance, the Ricci flow on manifolds with boundary. As for the Penrose Inequality, it was originally put forth by Penrose to study what is perhaps the most important open question in General Relativity today, namely the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (whether spacetime singularities are always enclosed by black holes), which is related to General Relativity's veracity as a physical theory. Heuristically, the Penrose Inequality is essentially a necessary condition for cosmic censorship to hold. Thus if the Penrose Inequality were to be confirmed it would add significantly to the general belief in the validity of cosmic censorship. Lastly, our methods developed for the full Penrose Inequality are expected to provide a new powerful tool for reducing questions concerning general initial data sets to the case of time symmetry, and therefore will have numerous applications to a wide range of other problems in General Relativity."

He will continue his work on fast conformal mapping algorithms, including the class of Schwarz-Christoffel iterations. These include Davis' method and the CRDT algorithm of Driscoll and Vavasis as special cases, and other methods involving the medial axis and quasiconformal mappings.  One of the basic themes is to start with certain quasiconformal maps that approximate the desired conformal map, but are easier to compute and have better properties. These maps have natural connections to several well known problems such as Brennan's conjecture, and the PI will investigate these connections. The PI will also continue his work on various related problems involving optimal meshing algorithms, diffusion limited aggregation, the geometry of Brownian motion, the quasiconformal Jacobian problem and conformal welding.<br/><br/>A fundamental problem of mathematics and engineering is to quickly and accurately solve various differential equations related to fluid flow, heat conduction and wave propagation on complex regions.  For 2-dimensional surfaces, a standard method is to use a conformal mapping (i.e., angle preserving on small scales) to replace the region with a simpler one, such as a disk or rectangle. This approach has been studied for over 150 years, but not until the 1980's did computers made conformal mapping practical for highly complex regions.  The PI will investigate how to improve existing methods and develop new ones that are faster and more reliable. He will also investigate the theoretical behavior of conformal maps on extremely complex domains such as fractals and the connections between conformal maps and probability theory. The PI has already applied the insights gained from these problems to meshing. This is the process of dividing a complex region into simple pieces such as triangles.  Meshing is a basic part of most numerical methods and the usefulness of a mesh in applications depends on the number of pieces (fewer is better) and their shapes (better to avoid small and large angles).  It is difficult to construct a mesh which is good in both respects, but PI has used non-Euclidean geometry to construct 2-dimensional quadrilateral meshes with optimal size and shapes for simple polygons and is working to extend this to more general domains.  Greater generality is needed in various problems involving crack formation, interfaces between materials and computer learning.  Efficient meshing also has numerous applications in high-performance computing such as modeling surfaces for engineering and computer graphics.

Prior results by the PI in this area include a joint work with Andre Neves in 2002 that classifies prime 3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than RP^3 and a 2008 paper with Pengzi Miao that gives an upper bound on the capacity of surfaces in 3-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature. In 2009, the PI's joint paper with Simon Brendle, Michael Eichmair, and AndreNeves proves that A_{min}R_{min} \le 12\pi on compact 3-manifolds which contain embedded incompressible RP^2, where A_{min} is the area of the minimal RP^2 and R_{min} is the minimum value of the scalar curvature. Using Ricci flow, they show that the 3-manifold is a spherical space form in the case of equality. Second, the PI will continue to work toward a proof of the full Penrose conjecture. The PI's 2001 paper proved the Riemannian Penrose conjecture in dimension 3, improving the case of one black hole proved by Huisken and Ilmanen to any number of black holes using a different technique. Since then, the PI proved a similar type of inequality for zero area singularities in 2005 (with some additional hypotheses), the Riemannian Penrose conjecture in dimensions less than 8 in a joint work with Dan Lee in 2007, and showed that the full Penrose conjecture on Cauchy data (M^3,g,k) reduces to the Riemannian case whenever certain systems of p.d.e.s can be solved in a joint work with Marcus Khuri in 2009. These systems of p.d.e.s rely on a new identity that they proved called the Generalized Schoen-Yau identity, which they believe will be a very useful identity for a broad range of problems in mathematical relativity. Third, the PI is opening up a new research direction for himself as he examines the axioms of general relativity to see how they may be modified as little as possible to account for the widely accepted existence of dark matter.<br/><br/>Einstein's theory of general relativity was made possible by Gauss and Riemann, both mathematicians, who developed the field of mathematics called differential geometry decades before. Since then, advances in differential geometry have played a crucial role in understanding the implications of Einstein's theory. Einstein used differential geometry to make the qualitative statement ``matter curves spacetime'' precise, thereby showing that gravity results as a consequence of this fundamental idea. By contrast, Newton's inverse square law for gravity has been shown to be false by measuring the precession of the orbit of Mercury. Hence, understanding gravity correctly would appear to require understanding the properties of curvature, currently pursued most directly by mathematicians studying geometric analysis. Black holes, predicted by general relativity and now known to exist, are fundamentally geometric objects, and have been the focus of much of the PI's efforts, resulting in theorems which yield a deeper physical insight into these fascinating phenomena. In light of this rich history of geometric analysis playing a crucial role in understanding the large scale structure of the universe, the PI is now looking to geometric motivations to try to understand the nature of dark matter. While dark matter is known to make up 23% of the mass of the universe and hence has very important gravitational effects, it is otherwise invisible. A geometric idea observed by the PI, as well as other motivations, leads to considering a real-valued scalar field as a model for dark matter, described by the Einstein Klein-Gordon equations. Astrophysicists have already observed that this model for dark matter is consistent with the flat rotation curves of galaxies. The PI is studying the idea that density waves in this scalar field dark matter produce density waves in regular matter, resulting in star formation and both bars and spiral patterns in some galaxies, an exciting possibility supported by preliminary simulations. If correct, this would suggest that while dark matter itself is invisible, its gravitational effects may be quite dramatic."

As an important evolutionary equation, it sets up a bridge between geometry and topology. In the past three decades, there have been many exciting achievements of the Ricci flow. In 2002, Perelman used the Ricci flow to solve the folklore Poincare conjecture. In 2007, Richard Schoen and Simon Brendle used the Ricci flow to prove the famous sphere theorem. These examples and many others highlight one fact that the Ricci flow is a powerful tool which deserves intensive study. The success of these previous examples is based on the knowledge of the global behavior of the Ricci flows with special conditions. Specially, either the dimension of the underlying manifold is three, or the curvature operator (or isotropic curvature) is nonnegative.  However, in a general higher dimensional Ricci flow, we can hardly determine the sign of the curvature operator. The global picture of the Ricci flow is still unclear. There remain a lot of technical  difficulties to overcome. Therefore, the study of the Ricci flows with weaker curvature constraints becomes natural and necessary. The Ricci flows' behavior under sectional curvature and Ricci curvature bounds have been solved by Hamilton and Sesum.  Naturally, the next step is to understand the behavior of the Ricci flow under the condition that scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. On the other hand, Perelman's fundamental work reveals that there are many Ricci flows where scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. Therefore, the Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature deserve comprehensive study. My research proposal is to study these Ricci flows.<br/><br/>The Ricci flow is an evolution equation solution on a Riemannian manifold. The Ricci flow is an important tool to find Einstein metrics, which are crucial in general relativity and mirror symmetry, my study is closely related to physics and Kahler geometry.  It naturally interacts with mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, complex analysis and partial differential equations.  Therefore, the study of the Ricci flow has broader impact outside the area of geometric analysis.  Among all Ricci flows, the Ricci flow with bounded scalar curvature is a very important type. This type of Ricci flows appear naturally in many settings. For example, according to the deep work of Perelman, the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded along the Ricci flows on many Kahler manifolds. My research proposal focuses on the study of the Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature. The success of this project will greatly benefit the understanding of properties of many Riemannian manifolds."

One example is the gradient flow of the square norm of the curvature tensor, a natural fourth-order parabolic equation whose critical points unify various important classes of metrics on four-manifolds.  Another important example is a generalization of Kahler Ricci flow to non-Kahler complex manifolds introduced in prior work of the PI and G. Tian.  By utilizing methods from the well-developed theory of Ricci flow as well as techniques from complex geometry, the PI proposes to refine his existing work to understand the singularity formation of these flows.  Aside from the intrinsic value of understanding physically natural equations, one possible direct application is to understand the topology of complex surfaces.<br/><br/>The method of geometric flows is a relatively new technique for understanding the structure of geometric objects.  Ultimately, by understanding these equations one can gain a deep understanding of topological structures.  Furthermore, these equations typically have a physical motivation, and hence by understanding them we gain insight into natural physical processes.  Even beyond these theoretical uses geometric flows have recently seen industrial application.  The proposed research will thus add to our overall understanding in these important areas."

Over the years, the PIs have established a number of fundamental affine isoperimetric inequalities and their analytic counterparts. Newly developed methods (by the PIs and others) will be exploited to attack long-conjectured inequalities. One of the PIs showed how an old notion of p-sum of convex bodies leads to an embryonic p-Brunn-Minkowski theory. The p-inequalities which arise in the new theory turn out to be almost invariably stronger than their classical counterparts.  Recent advances have demonstrated the need to move to the next evolutionary step in the development of the Brunn-Minkowski theory: An Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory. Very recently, the PIs have succeeded in discovering the Orlicz analogue of two fundamental operators from the Brunn-Minkowski theory and have established the fundamental affine isoperimetric inequalities for them. The development of an Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory will be a main focus of the PIs efforts. Just as the classical Minkowski problem is a central focus of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory, its p-analogue is central to the p-Brunn-Minkowski theory. The Orlicz versions of this elliptic partial differential equation are a central focus of the Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory and a sustained attack on this partial differential equation will be undertaken. The study of projections and intersections of convex bodies is fundamental and of significant practical value. The Brunn-Minkowski theory together with the cosine transform from harmonic analysis are ideal tools for the study of projections. There is a fascinating duality in convex geometry. One of the PIs initiated the study of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, which together with Radon transforms are the necessary tools for the study of intersections and to solve long-standing open problems as shown by previous work of one of the PIs and others. Continued development of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory is proposed. Work of the PIs and others, indicates that there are interesting connections between Information Theory (a subject usually associated with Electrical Engineering) and convex geometric analysis. The PIs will continue their exploration of the interactions between these subjects.<br/><br/>The Brunn-Minkowski theory is the core of convex geometric analysis and is the foundation of subjects such as geometric tomography and stereology. These subjects investigate mathematical problems with strong practical backgrounds such as measuring the diffusion capacity of the lung, determining the volume of minerals in rocks, and detecting tumors in the human body. Numerous applications of the Brunn-Minkowski theory have been discovered in mathematics, science and engineering. For example, the reconstruction of hidden objects from information regarding sections (think CAT scan machines) involves a tomographic analysis.  The proposed work should result in the development of new theories and techniques in convex geometric analysis which are potential new mathematical tools with applications to science and engineering."

The ""symplectic revolution"" of the 1980s gave rise to the discovery of surprising rigidity phenomena involving symplectic manifolds, their subsets and diffeomorphisms. A number of recent advances show that there is yet another manifestation of symplectic rigidity, taking place in function spaces associated to a symplectic manifold. These spaces exhibit unexpected properties and interesting structures, giving rise to an alternative intuition and new tools in symplectic topology, and providing a motivation to study the function theory on symplectic manifolds.  Development of this new theory and its applications is the main objective of the proposed research. We focus on the following topics. First, we study robustness of the Poisson bracket. The Poisson bracket is a basic operation which involves a pair of functions and is defined by their derivatives.  Certain characteristics of the Poisson bracket exhibit surprising robustness properties with respect to small perturbations in the uniform norm, even though such perturbations can dramatically change the derivatives. This phenomenon appears to be closely related to Hofer's geometry on the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms. Second, we deal with various aspects of the theory of symplectic quasi-states. Consider the space of functions on a symplectic manifold. A symplectic quasi-state is a monotone functional on this space which is linear on every Poisson-commutative subalgebra, but not necessarily on the whole space. The origins of this notion go back to foundations of quantum mechanics. Non-linear quasi-states on higher-dimensional manifolds are provided by Floer theory, the cornerstone of modern symplectic topology. Quasi-states serve as a useful tool for a number of problems in symplectic topology such as symplectic intersections and Lagrangian knots. Finally, we unify both topics and explore interrelations between symplectic quasi-states and Poisson brackets.<br/><br/>Symplectic topology fruitfully interacts with several areas of science, which have a significant impact on society through their applications to technology. One of these areas is Hamiltonian dynamics, a mathematical discipline providing efficient tools for modeling a variety of fundamental physical and technological processes such as orbital motion of satellites, propagation of light in optical fibers and motion of charged particles through accelerators.  Another one is quantum theory, a branch of physics which studies behavior of matter on microscopic scales, and whose potential applications reach as far as cryptography and computer technology. Development of function theory on symplectic manifolds that is put forward in the present proposal leads to a new insight on robust measurements in Hamiltonian dynamics and reveals a new facet of the quantum-classical correspondence, a fundamental principle of quantum theory."

In the first project the PI will study a recent conjecture of Donaldson that aims at extending Yau's theorem in Kahler geometry to symplectic four-manifolds, building on his work with Weinkove and Yau. If proved, this conjecture would provide a powerful new tool to construct symplectic forms on compact symplectic four-manifolds, and would have striking applications to symplectic topology. The second project regards the geometry of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, and specifically the way in which Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on a Calabi-Yau manifold can degenerate when their cohomology class approaches the boundary of the Kahler cone. These degenerations have also been studied by string theorists in connection with mirror symmetry. The PI proposes to continue his study of these degenerations, as well as investigating Ricci-flat metrics on a family of quintic threefolds near a large complex structure limit. The third project falls in the area of canonical metrics on compact Kahler manifolds, such as Kahler-Einstein or constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics. It is believed that the existence of such canonical metrics should be equivalent to the algebraic stability of the manifold. The PI will study this using two natural evolution equations associated to these problems, the Kahler-Ricci flow and the Calabi flow, with the aim of connecting the limiting behaviour of the flows to algebraic stability through the use of natural energy functionals. The final project also involves canonical Kahler metrics, and more specifically the problem of existence of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics on complex surfaces with ample canonical bundle in cohomology classes that are known to be stable.<br/><br/><br/>Most of the problems that we will consider, for example the Einstein equations, were originally discovered by physicists who were searching for models of the fundamental laws of nature. More recently, geometric aspects closely related to the proposed research have found applications in high energy physics, and are being used to deepen our understanding of the Universe and of elementary particles. The geometric ideas of the PI's research revolve around the problem of finding the optimal shape of a geometric space, the one with the largest possible symmetry, and understanding the possible singularities that form in spaces where such an optimal shape does not exist. Any progress on these questions will not only shed some light on some basic problems in mathematics, but will also have applications in physics and other sciences."

On the mirror symmetry side, we consider decompositions of symplectic manifolds into pairs-of-pants, in the sense of Mikhalkin. One question under consideration is whether the Fukaya category can be reconstructed by gluing together pieces corresponding to each pair-of-pants. In general, this is not true and has to be modified by instanton contributions. However, there are cases where such contributions should be absent, and this would give a new viewpoint on Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture.<br/><br/>From a broader perspective, a crucial issue in many current investigations in physics and mathematics is the emergence of the classical notion of space from a quantum description. In the situation under study here, the main feature is that the construction of the classical space involves a series of gradual distortions, which can be determined by complicated but explicit formulae. This is a simplified mathematical model of a general class of physical theories, and not realistic as such. However, studying such models shows us where we are facing conceptual difficulties, which is important in order to develop our understanding further."

The first concerns the analytic and geometric structure of metric measure spaces for which the measure is doubling and a Poincare inequality holds, and also the behavior of Lipschitz maps from such spaces to the Banach space $L_1$. This study has connections with and applications to a number of areas of mathematics and to theoretical computer science. The second area of the proposal concerns the degeneration of Einstein metrics,  especially in dimension 4, with particular emphasis on the collapsed case.  The eventual goal is a complete understanding of all possible degenerations. The third area concerns the spectral geometry approach to obtaining combinatorial formulas for the Pontrjagin classes of a triangulated manifold in terms of $\eta$-invariants of links. A scheme for modifying this formula is proposed, leading to a formula which is local on all iterated links. This comes at the cost of choosing certain additional data on the links; some such choice cannot be avoided if one wants a formula of this type.<br/><br/><br/>A basic distinction in mathematics is between objects which are everywhere smooth (like the surface of a sphere) and objects (like the surface of a cube) which contain non-smooth parts, referred to as singularities. The emphasis in this project, which has three distinct sections, is on the study of the singular parts of various classes of objects.  The first section is concerned with a class of objects which  may have no smooth parts whatsoever ,and yet, they can be studied by methods of calculus. Surprisingly, such objects arise``naturally'' in various mathematical contexts. An even bigger surprise is that their study has applications to theoretical computer science. The second section of the project considers objects which are smoothly curved and whose curvature is constrained in a certain way.  (They satisfy the so-called Einstein equation.) One wants to understand what are the``worst"" examples of such objects. This leads in limiting cases to objects with singularities and the goal is to understand precisely what kinds of singularities can arise in this way. For instance, some of the examples in the first section of the project can arise in this way, but many  cannot.  The third section is concerned with objects which have smooth versions and also ""piecewise flat"" versions (with singularities). For instance, from the standpoint of topology, the surface of a sphere and the surface of a cube are equivalent i.e. one can be deformed continuously into the other. The sphere is smooth, while the surface of a cube  is ""piecewise flat"", in the sense that it can be assembled by appropriately joining together 6 (flat)  squares along their edges. We study certain topological measurements of such piecewise flat objects and show that they can be computed by adding up certain geometrical quantities which<br/>are measured only at the most singular parts."

The talks by Tudor Ratiu and Jerrold Marsden will focus on applications of symplectic geometry to a wide problems in physics and engineering such as as fluid and plasma theory, liquid crystals and micropolar fluids.<br/><br/><br/>The goal behind this conference is that of holding a high profile meeting to bring together world experts and junior researchers to discuss these current exciting interactions. The time of the conference (May 2010) coincides with the first year anniversary of Alan Weinstein?s retirement from UC Berkeley. Weinstein has been one of the most influential figures in symplectic geometry and analysis in the past forty years. His fundamental work has inspired many mathematicians and led to the development of central concepts in symplectic and Poisson geometry, as well as to the establishment of symplectic geometry as an independent discipline within mathematics. The conference will provide a forum to dicuss Weinstein's impact on geometry and mathematics at large. The last few decades have witnessed numerous spectacular interactions between symplectic geometry, analysis, low dimensional topology and partial differential equations leading to new understanding in fundamental problems of mathematics. Today symplectic geometry is an active, central branch of mathematics populated by deep results and connections with physics, low-dimensional topology, gauge theory, integrable systems, representation theory, group theory, semiclassical analysis and Lie groups. The main theme of the Conference is to illuminate the particular type of interactions which characterize the past forty years of developments in symplectic geometry.  To this end the conference will have talks by leading experts, both junior and senior, describing the current state of the art of several of the most fundamental research problems in these areas. Symplectic and Poisson geometry are by now well established fields of research, and its language and techniques are being used in many areas of mathematics, theoretical physics, and engineering such as symmetric bifurcation problems, integrable systems, string theory, geometric phases, nonlinear control, nonholonomic mechanics and locomotion generation in robotics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The first group of problems addressed concerns generalizations of the Conley conjecture. Thisconjecture asserts the existence of infinitely many periodic points of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a symplectically aspherical, closed manifold. The Conley conjecture has been established by Hingston (for tori), the PI and eventually generalized to all symplectic manifolds with zero Chern class. However, many aspects of the problem require further investigation. The PI outlines an approach to the proof of the Conley conjecture for manifolds with large minimal Chern class and to some classes of symplectomorphisms and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with ""too many"" fixed points. A refinement of the almost existence theorem for periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems and an investigation of periodic orbits of twisted geodesic flows, closely related to the Conley conjecture, are also considered in the proposal. The second part of the proposal focuses on symplectic topological properties of coisotropic submanifolds. These properties generalize the Lagrangian intersection property and the Liouville and Maslov class rigidity to a certain class of coisotropic submanifolds, the so-called stable submanifolds.  Moreover, a general picture has emerged, enabling one to treat such facts as non-existence of exact Lagrangian embeddings and the existence of closed characteristics on a contact type hypersurface as particular cases of one phenomenon. The main goal of the program started by the PI and continued in the proposal is to further analyze this picture and to extend coisotropic rigidity results to a broader class of submanifolds.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of physical processes in which dissipative forces can be neglected. For example, planetary motion in celestial mechanics and some electro- or magneto-dynamical processes can be, and usually are, treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the classical subjects lying at the very core of modern theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems and symplectic geometry is the study of periodic orbits (i.e., cyclic motions). Periodic orbits are ubiquitous: a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems have periodic orbits and the number of distinct periodic orbits is infinite for a broad class of systems. The analysis of this phenomenon, building on the PI's recent work, is among the main objectives of the proposed research. For instance, the PI proposes to show that Hamiltonian systems of a certain type have infinitely many periodic orbits. The class of dynamical systems in question includes those describing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field and the proposed research has potential applications to physics and mathematical aspects of mechanics."

The goals are the determination of the extent to which the F-theory constructions can be studied locally; determining how the mathematical structure of the local Picard group allows the hypercharge gauge symmetry in the physical theory to survive to low energy; and studying various specific aspects of elliptic fibrations (codimension three phenomena, canonical bundle formulae) which may affect how numerous the F-theory models are.<br/><br/>Particle physicists have employed a wide variety of sophisticated mathematical tools to help explain the behavior and structure of our world at a subatomic level.  In preparation for the data which will soon be available from the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), theoretical particle physicists have been refining their predictions; in some cases, these refinements can only be made if the mathematical tools themselves are improved.  The research funded by this grant aims to improve one of the important mathematical tools currently being used, a tool known as ``elliptic fibrations'' which comes from the geometric study of solutions of polynomial equations, a part of the mathematical field of algebraic geometry.  Recent uses of this tool by theoretical particle physicists have focussed attention on some areas where it needs improvement in order to be able to make the necessarily calculations for particle physics; this research will make those improvements."

Donaldson. The stability conjecture in Kaehler geometry relates the existence of the extremal metrics to the stability of the underlying complex projective variety. The stability conjecture and related problems are fundamental problems in Kaehler  geometry, which has tight relation with the partial differential equations, complex analysis and algebraic geometry.  The precise understanding of the Calabi flow will lead to solving such a conjecture.  Inspired by Perelman's success in Hamilton's problem to solve geometrization conjecture by Ricci  flow, the PI proposes to study the Calabi  flow to attack the existence of extremal metrics. The key issue for the Calabi flow is the long time existence, the asymptotic behavior and related problems. Based on the previous work of the PI and his collaborators, he plans to further study the Calabi flow on Kaehler surfaces,  in particular  on Del Pezzo surfaces and toric surfaces. The PI also plans to study the regularity problem of related PDEs, such as the complex Monge-Ampere equation, which is a fundamental equation in Kaehler geometry and is also closely related to the extremal metrics and the Calabi flow. In particular, the PI plans to study whether some regularity result, which has been proved for the real Monge-Ampere equation, holds or not for the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The study of  S. Donaldson's operator will give new insight on this.  Donaldson's operator can be viewed as an operator with some nature of both the real and complex Monge-Ampere operators. <br/><br/>Problems in the proposal arise naturally from our attempts to understand geometric partial dierential equations from geometry and physics, which have tight relation with many other fields such as algebraic geometry, complex analysis and mathematical physics.

Understanding this general principle  will have broad impact in physics and other fields of science in general.

Block<br/><br/>These projects aim to unify two main approaches to noncommutative geometry. The first, represented by Connes, is differential geometric and analytic in nature. The second, represented by Kontsevich et al, is algebraic geometric and categorical. The project deals with duality statements such as Mukai-duality and mirror symmetry from algebraic geometry and mathematical physics and the Baum-Connes conjecture from operator K-theory and noncommutative geometry. These dualities are expressed in terms of categories of modules. He develops a new framework essential to describe these dualities.  In various geometric contexts, e.g. complex geometry, generalized complex geometry, and noncommutative geometry, the geometric structure is encoded in a certain curved differential graded algebra. He develops the module theory of such differential graded algebras in such a way that he can recover the triangulated category of sheaves with coherent cohomology on a complex manifold. This framework provides a common context for the noncommutative geometry of Connes and that of Kontsevich.  The PI proposes to use this framework to study the following situations.  PI will analyze how Mukai equivalences behave under deformations.  For example, if one starts with a Mukai equivalence between two complex manifolds and deforms one of the manifolds as an algebroid stack, then it is possible to determine how the other manifold deforms and prove a Mukai equivalence for these two new objects. This generalizes two previous works of the PI and coauthors. Second, he defines a curved dga corresponding to a symplectic manifold. The framework then gives a dg-category. He will study how this relates to the Fukaya category. Next the PI will study the rational homotopy of non-nilpotent spaces within the context of this framework. Finally, PI proposes to study the Beilinson Bernstein localization theorem within the context of Connes noncommutative geometry, and relate it to the Baum Connes conjecture.<br/><br/>An exciting development over the past several years has been the proliferation of new kinds of geometries as well as surprising links between well known ones. These developments have been motivated by work in many areas within mathematics as well as fundamental particle physics and engineering.  The proposed work will create a framework to study these new geometries as well as to express dualities, that is the links, between them.  By its broad nature, this study will bring a cross-section of mathematics and mathematicians, as well as researchers in other fields in contact with the PI, his colleagues and his students. In addition to his teaching, the PI offers seminars for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows that introduce them to a broader understanding of geometry and their dualities.  The PI speaks internationally at conferences that bring together topologists, algebraic geometers and physicists. PI also cultivates connections to the finance industry, and develops courses and training material in mathematics of finance, to serve as a resource for undergraduates.

The principal investigator proposes to have an intensive study by combining differential geometric methods with other newly developed techniques to solve several fundamental problems about the geometry and topology of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau manifolds. Differential geometric methods combined with algebraic geometry and combinatorial methods have been very successful in proving various important conjectures such as the Marino-Vafa conjecture, the Faber intersection number conjecture and the Labastilda-Marino-Ooguri-Vafa conjecture in our previous work. Based on these and other geometric results, the PI will further understand and solve several important problems including finding the explicit tautological ring structure of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, proving the general string duality conjecture and solving the general Torelli problem for projective manifolds and clarifying its relation to mirror symmetry.<br/> <br/>Calabi-Yau manifolds are very important in string theory, the most promising theory to unify the four fundamental forces in the Nature. They are the shapes that satisfy the requirement of space for the six hidden spatial dimensions of string theory, which must be contained in a space smaller than our currently observable lengths. Riemann surfaces are called world-sheet in string theory which are the most basic objects in conformal field theory. The recent development of string duality in string theory has motivated many exciting new mathematical results. Many fundamental computations in string theory and quantum field theory are often reduced to certain integrals on moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau manifolds. By comparing the mathematical descriptions of different string theories, one often reveals quite deep and unexpected mathematical conjectures, many of which are related to moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau manifolds. The mathematical proofs of these conjectures often help verify the physical theories which cannot be achieved today through traditional experiments. Our project will lead to very strong impacts on several major fields of mathematics and theoretical physics. This program will not only help verify certain important physical theories in string theory, but also produce beautiful and fundamental results in mathematics. In carrying out the project we will also train several young students and post-doctors to conduct research in these subjects through collaboration and lectures."

This procedure allows to avoid many anomalies coursed by usual zeta-function regularization. It also turns out to be the most adequate for description of non-linear sigma-models of superconductivity. In a joint project with A.

The first topic is the study rigidity theorems (i.e. metric uniqueness) of compact manifolds. Here for example is considered isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or Lengths of closed geodesics) be isometric. This also includes questions about metric rigidity induced by conjugacy of geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems. The second topic involves isoperimetric inequalities. The ideal is to find sharp isoperimetric inequalities and study the equality case. This at times ties in with the first topic. It also involves systolic inequalities and other inequalities between geometric quantities.  Another topic concerns infinite groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively curved spaces X (in the sense of Alexandrov). The project is to study the relationship between the geometry of X and the induced action of G on the ideal boundary of X. This can be considered an aspect of geometric group theory. The final topic is geometric optics. This topic involves using differential geometric techniques to design mirrors and lenses to accomplish prescribe optics functions.<br/><br/><br/>The rigidity theme of the project is a continuing project with many different aspects. In general these problems concern the question of whether a space can be determined by a prescribed set of data.  One aspect of this concerns questions of remote sensing.  For example: can you determine the density of an object (say a brain or the earth) from measurements taken ""from the outside""?  The CAT scan is a practical example where one determines the mass density (or more accurately the absorption coefficient) of an object from measurements of the total mass along straight lines.  An alternative set of measurements is the set of times it takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary (this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in the proposal).  A related set of measurements is to record the exit times and directions of geodesics given their entry directions (this is the ""geodesic lens"" or ""scattering"" data).  The thrust of the proposed study is to determine under which circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of closed geodesics, distances between boundary points, lens data) are sufficient to completely determine the geometry of the spaces in question.  In some cases it is non-uniqueness that is interesting.  <br/>For example, in cloaking the goal is to make it the space in question (the object to be cloaked) appear from the outside like a different space (empty space).  One aspect of the optics theme of the proposal is the design of multiple mirror (or lens) systems.  An example to consider with multiple mirrors is a periscope.  By designing appropriately curved mirrors in the periscope one can make for example a non-distorting wide angle periscope or a non-distorting magnifying periscope."

There are several goals of the proposal which include: (1) To classify the asymptotic behavior of complete embedded constant mean curvature surfaces of finite topology in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and more generally, in a general X. (2) To prove that the moduli space M(X) of constant mean curvature spheres in X is an interval parametrized by the mean curvature function and consists entirely of index-1 spheres (this interval has an end point with an index-0 sphere in the case X the the product of a round sphere with R).

Related theoretical techniques concerning compactness, removable singularities results, regularity and convergence of embedded minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces of locally bounded genus will be investigated as well.  Another main goal is to understand the existence and nonexistence of complete, bounded embedded minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces in Euclidean 3-space and in other 3-dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/><br/>Classical minimal and constant mean curvature surface theory has its roots in18-th and 19-{th century mathematics. Minimal surfaces are the first important two dimensional examples of what is called the calculus of variations, first described by Euler around 1735; constant mean curvature surfaces were first studied by Delaunay in 1835 also represent important examples in the calculus of variations.  Physically minimal surfaces can be modeled locally as soap films on wires or by surfaces of least-area relative to their local boundaries; physically constant mean curvature surfaces can be modeled locally as soap films on wires with a constant pressure difference on each side.  Minimal surfaces play an important role as a tool in the study of 3-dimensional topology and Riemannian geometry.  The research in this proposal concerns global and local properties of embedded minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces and possible applications of these results to basic research in three-dimensional topology and geometry. In part because of the important connections with other areas of mathematics and the ease in which it is possible to make computer graphics pictures of beautiful classical examples, minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces continue to be one of the principal topics for popular science articles and public science exhibits.  Thus, indirectly, the exciting research problems outlined in this proposal help bring many young scientists and mathematicians to the frontiers of research."

The core geometric structure considered here is that of a compact manifold with corners, together with the smooth maps between such spaces, and the basic operations of compactification and blow up. To demonstrate the utility of these ideas the Principal Investigator proposes to study from this point of view the following four problems: The resolution of smooth actions by compact Lie groups and the use of such `full resolutions' in topology, index theory and analysis. The compactification of moduli spaces of magnetic monopoles. The asymptotic behavior of solutions to Einstein's equation. The resolution of Morse-type fibrations with applications to adiabatic limits and the existence of Kaehler metrics.<br/><br/>In studying solutions of mathematical problems in the large, such as the long-time behaviour of solutions to Einstein's equation, it is particularly useful to `bring infinity' closer by compactifying the space. After doing so, such `asymptotic' questions are replaced by regularity problems in a more conventional sense. This process of compactification is dual to the operation of resolution of singularities, by the iteratrive introduction of polar coordinates. These two processes naturally occur together in a systematc study of transition behaviour of analytic-geometric problems."

A Stein manifold is a properly embedded complex submanifold of complex affine space. This has a symplectic form induced from the standard one in affine space. If we take a large sphere and intersect it with this Stein manifold then we get another manifold called a Stein fillable contact manifold. Important progress in studying Stein manifolds symplectically was achieved by Eliashberg and Gromov. The primary aim of this project is to find exotic Stein structures and Stein fillable contact structures.  The PI intends to prove that there are uncountably many symplectically different Stein structures diffeomorphic to an even dimensional manifold admitting a proper and bounded from below Morse function with only finitely many critical points of index at most half its dimension. The PI also intends to prove that there are infinitely many Stein fillable contact structures on each odd dimensional sphere of dimension 5 and higher, and more generally on Stein fillable contact manifolds obtained from affine varieties. The PI will use an invariant of Stein manifolds called symplectic homology to distinguish these. The PI also aims to show that there is no algorithm to tell you whether one Stein manifold diffeomorphic to affine space is symplectomorphic to another one diffeomorphic to affine space of complex dimension greater than 6. The PI also aims prove a similar undecidability result for contact structures on all odd dimensional spheres of dimension greater than 13. The PI will use an invariant called the growth rate of symplectic homology to achieve this. The PI will use growth rates to show that certain cotangent bundles have many Reeb orbits (even degenerate ones). This generalizes the Gromoll-Meyer theorem. The PI will show that the cotangent bundle of a rationally hyperbolic manifold is not symplectomorphic to a smooth affine variety using growth rates.<br/><br/>If we have some classical system such as a pendulum then at any point in time it has a particular position and momentum. If this system has many moving parts such as a double pendulum or a collection free particles then it has many positions and momenta. The set of all such positions and momenta can be encoded in an object called a symplectic manifold. For example the symplectic manifold associated to a pendulum turns out to be a cylinder. Symplectic manifolds are important in many areas of physics such as quantum mechanics and String theory. The PI will study a large class of symplectic manifolds obtained from objects called Stein manifolds. The PI will construct a large list of Stein manifolds called exotic Stein manifolds which look very similar to the symplectic manifold coming from a set of free particles but are actually different if we look at the motion of their respective classical systems. The PI intends to show that there is no computer algorithm telling you if two given exotic Stein manifolds come from the same classical system. This result is useful because it tells us that certain classical systems are very hard to study in general."

A central goal of this project is to resolve or advance a decade-old open problem of expressing Gromov-Witten invariants of Kahler manifolds defined as holomorphic Euler characteristics of complex vector bundles in terms of cohomological invariants of these bundles. Such expression would establish a true ""quantum"" analogue of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem. As a technical tool, the orbifold version of the classical Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem will be applied to Kontsevich's moduli spaces of stable maps. Applications of the theory to finite difference equations and integrable systems, representation theory of quantum groups, and the mirror symmetry phenomenon are expected.<br/><br/>From a more general perspective, problems we deal with in our research lie on the crossroad of two major pathways in mathematics of the last two centuries. One of them is the in-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic curves - in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi, Riemann, Klein and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual landscaping of mathematical physics dictated by the progress of classical and quantum mechanics and often associated with the names of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare, Hilbert, Einstein and Weyl. It is string theory that in the search for the ultimate laws of nature places algebraic curves at the center of the modern landscape of fundamental physics, and generates new mathematical questions and points out plausible answers with an amazing pace and persistence. Some of the problems we work on are motivated by such questions, some others hopefully provide answers that string theory did not really anticipate."

The first project concerns the fundamental problems in asymptotically flat manifolds, particularly center of mass and constant mean curvature foliations.  The PI has proved that the notion of Hamiltonian center of mass is well-defined in the time-slice and has constructed the constant mean curvature foliation whose geometric center is equal to the center of mass. The PI is proposing to further investigate the properties of center of mass in spacetime and the time evolution of center of mass and the foliation. The existence of constant mean curvature foliation is important for understanding the intrinsic geometry of asymptotically flat manifolds. The PI will continue to study the existence of the foliation even when the Hamiltonian center of mass might not be defined. In addition, a new density theorem previously developed by the PI shows that the solutions with harmonic asymptotics are generic in the space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations. She intends to use the theorem to further study the physical quantities of the solutions, such as angular momentum. The second project deals with compact manifolds with boundary in various ambient spaces. The PI with Damin Wu developed the rigidity results on hemispheres for hypersurfaces with boundary in either Euclidean space or hyperbolic space. She plans to develop the analogous rigidity theorems for hypersurfaces with boundary in the sphere and for submanifolds in Euclidean space with higher codimensions under several different curvature conditions.<br/><br/>The PI's projects will lead to a better understanding of the physical quantities and their connection to geometry in asymptotically flat manifolds, which model the isolated systems in general relativity. In particular, the constant mean curvature foliation provides an intrinsic coordinate system for isolated systems. The foliation will be useful to understand the interaction of black holes in the problem of binary black holes which is fundamental in both theoretical and numerical physics. She also believes that the canonical coordinate system is helpful for numerists from different groups to compare their results established under different coordinate systems. The remainder of the PI's proposed work about compact regions with boundary naturally arises in general relativity and in various physical situations. It is fundamental to characterize and to classify the model cases, such as the flat regions and spheres. The rigidity results on these geometric objects are essential for the classification."

In particular, he proposes projects in several areas of classical minimal surface theory, all concerned with using Teichmuller theory to prove existence or uniqueness or properties of minimal surfaces in Euclidean three-space. He proposes research in two areas of Teichmuller theory: Weil-Petersson geometry and grafting.  Both bring a Riemannian perspective to problems often studied via other methods. In addition, he proposes studying problems arising in convex projective structures on surfaces as well as work on degenerating harmonic quasi-isometries of the hyperbolic plane. These last are informed by his earlier work on high energy harmonic maps. In recent years, the PI has focused considerable attention upon education at all levels. He supervises graduate students; he coordinates a VIGRE program at Rice University encompassing roughly a dozen small research groups in the mathematical sciences whose vertical organization ranges from the undergraduate stratum through the graduate and postdoctoral level to the permanent faculty; he participates in one of these groups himself, he lectures to teachers and acts as a scientific advisor to programs to enhance the mathematical understanding of K-12 teachers.  He serves the broader mathematical community by serving on the editorial board of three journals, through organizing large and small conferences and through lectures to general audiences. He is quite involved with undergraduate advising. The PI will continue with all of these activities.<br/><br/>One of the guiding principles of science is that Nature is efficient: when we encounter natural phenomenon, we expect that the shapes we find will use the least material for their construction, or be the thinnest that can be made with a material or will span the largest region possible, or some other sort of optimization.  At the same time, a common geometric component of many natural systems is a two-dimensional surface, usually configured in some curved manner.  These surfaces occur at all scales, from the boundary of a protein to the surface of the brain to the frontier of the magnetosphere.  In this project, we investigate problems that relate aspects of the shapes of surfaces to quantities they might optimize, and also how deforming one feature of the shape of a surface affects other qualities of that surface."

Calabi-Yau manifolds, essentially shapes that satisfy the requirement of space for the six ""unseen"" spatial dimensions of the present model of Universe, are a key object of research in superstring theory. The problems investigated in this project are among the most natural in their context and possess several interesting additional applications in neighboring areas of Mathematics, such as Complex Geometry<br/>and Topology."

In particular she intends to<br/>describe possible realizing manifolds and to link their geometry<br/>to the type of system they realize. In the past the PI has<br/>studied how biHamiltonian structures are generated by the<br/>geometry of curves in realizing manifolds. She also studied<br/>geometric realizations of equations of KdV type in Hermitian<br/>Symmetric manifolds, linking the projective character of<br/>differential invariants to equations of KdV-type. In this project<br/>she proposes to deepen this relation and to expand it to<br/>parabolic manifolds. In joint work with M. Eastwood she will be<br/>using tools in classical differential geometry to find projective<br/>structures on flows. Resolving this differential geometry problem<br/>will very likely create geometric realizations of KdV-type in<br/>parabolic manifolds. She will also investigate the possibility of<br/>a similar connection in other geometries, for example that of<br/>Schrdinger, mKdV and sine-Gordon flows to Riemannian<br/>geometry. Finally, in joint work with Calini and Ivey, the PI<br/>will study geometric and topological properties of solutions to<br/>realizations of soliton equations, in particular those<br/>corresponding to finite-gap solutions (periodic case). The study<br/>will try to link properties of these solutions to their spectral<br/>parameter.<br/><br/>Setting an appropriate geometric background is often a<br/>fundamental step in the resolution of a problem.  A choice of<br/>geometry establishes the properties and laws we wish to keep<br/>unchanged: Relativity (with Lorentzian geometry setting the<br/>interaction between space and time) and computer imaging (using<br/>projective geometry when 3D perspective needs to be preserved)<br/>are some of the best-known examples. But nowadays many engineers<br/>and physicists, including some groups working on data collection,<br/>consider a basic knowledge of differential geometry to be<br/>fundamental. Geometric thought is commonplace, as often finding<br/>the right choice of geometry for a problem is an initial step in<br/>its resolution - it all depends on how (or with which geometric<br/>eyes) you look at it -. BiHamiltonian nonlinear equations are<br/>very rich in structure and they are often used to model different<br/>types of phenomena. Their rich structure allows us to find a<br/>great deal of information about the system they model and to<br/>predict behavior. The best-known completely integrable systems<br/>are bi-Hamiltonian, and their solutions predict the behavior of<br/>fluids, from water waves in shallow water to the trailing<br/>vortices behind the wing tips of an airplane.  These phenomena do<br/>not, in principle, exist within any given geometric<br/>background. When we find geometric realizations for a completely<br/>integrable system we gain information in two different ways: 1)<br/>We learn that the behavior of these phenomena can be visualized<br/>within a certain geometry, and we learn how to visualize it. In<br/>particular, the same phenomena can be described in more than one<br/>geometry; 2) We learn that some geometries are hosts to phenomena<br/>that were not known to exist in that context before. For example,<br/>by linking projective and centro-equi-affine geometries, we can<br/>find evolutions of star-shaped curves that behave like solitary<br/>waves. The better we understand the relation between these two<br/>apparently unrelated subjects, the more we can transfer our<br/>extensive geometric knowledge, their connections and properties,<br/>to the understanding of completely integrable systems. And<br/>vice-versa."
