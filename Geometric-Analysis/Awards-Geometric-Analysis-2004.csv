Parker<br/><br/>This project involves analytic aspects of the theory of<br/>pseudo-holomorphic curves.  The aim is to develop effective<br/>methods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic<br/>manifolds and enumerative invariants of algebraic manifolds.  The<br/>main thrust is a continuing project with E. Ionel on the<br/>Gromov-Witten invariants of six-dimensional manifolds. String<br/>Theory is especially effective in making predictions about a<br/>special type of six-dimensional spaces called Calabi-Yau 3-folds.<br/>One of the most fascinating predictions of String Theory is the<br/>Gompakumar-Vafa conjecture, which claims that the plethora of<br/>Gromov-Witten invariants are determined by a more limited<br/>collection of `BPS numbers'.  The first proposed project seeks to<br/>derive and prove the Gompakumar-Vafa formulas by adapting the<br/>analytic methods that C. Taubes developed to relate the<br/>Seiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants.  This approach to the BPS<br/>numbers is different and more geometric than the physicists'.<br/><br/>The proposed work also includes efforts to extend the PI's<br/>previous work on Relative GW invariants to invariants relative to<br/>``a stratified symplectic subspace'', and to give a geometric and<br/>computationally effective description of the virtual fundamental<br/>class for symplectic manifolds which are not necessary<br/>semipositive.  A fourth project concerns the ``modified GW<br/>invariants'' defined by the P.I.'s student Junho Lee; those make<br/>it possible to study a class of manifolds (Kahler surfaces with<br/>positive geometric genus) where there are important conjectures<br/>that are not currently approachable by GW methods.  The last<br/>project is geometric analysis of a different sort aimed at<br/>understanding how supersymmetry simplifies expressions for heat<br/>kernels on manifolds.<br/><br/>One of the most notable developments in mathematics in the past<br/>decade has been the remarkable confluence of ideas coming from<br/>String Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Partial Differential<br/>Equations, and Symplectic Geometry.  A major part of that story<br/>revolves around the idea of counting holomorphic curves in<br/>algebraic manifolds.  That problem was studied for 100 years with<br/>few results.  Then, around 1990, it was realized that the problem<br/>can be translated into symplectic geometry and tackled using the<br/>powerful machinery of mathematical gauge theory. (Gauge theory,<br/>originally part of physics, has been the focus of many very<br/>fruitful interactions between mathematicians and physicists over<br/>the past twenty years; it includes Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten<br/>Theory, and String Theory).  This `Gromov-Witten invariant'<br/>approach led quickly to formulas answering some of the original<br/>curve-counting problems.  The subject is now advancing rapidly on<br/>many fronts, and is being continually stimulated by the<br/>predictions of physics.  This project is aimed toward further<br/>developing this theory using the gauge theory that is approach<br/>most closely aligned with physics, and to use the symplectic<br/>approach to make conceptual bridges between the algebraic and<br/>physics viewpoints.<br/>"

A significant theme here is the study of the<br/>  abundance of homoclinic tangencies and its effects. It has been<br/>  known for some time that homoclinic tangencies produce interesting<br/>  phenomena. They form an obstruction to structural stability, and have<br/>  a profound influence on bifurcations phenomena. While most of the<br/>  information we have about homoclinic tangencies may be considered<br/>  negative in regard to our ability to understand the underlying<br/>  dynamics, recently we obtained a positive result: generically they<br/>  lead to topologically transitive sets of maximal Hausdorff<br/>  dimension. One part of the current proposal involves understanding<br/>  the relation between these maximal dimension sets and Lebesgue<br/>  asymptotic measures. These are measures obtained by taking weak<br/>  limits of the averages of the iterates of measures which are<br/>  absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.  Recently we<br/>  have shown that in many dissipative cases SRB measures on surfaces<br/>  only exist on uniformly hyperbolic attractors.  We wish to extend<br/>  this to area preserving cases and to make progress on the conjecture<br/>  that generically in highly smooth systems  a non-Anosov area preserving<br/>  diffeomorphism of a surface has metric entropy zero. Another<br/>  question we will consider is whether the Henon family <br/>   has no SRB measure for a residual set of<br/>  parameters. It is a celebrated result of Benedicks-Carleson<br/>  and Benedicks-Young that SRB measures exist for a positive Lebesgue<br/>  measure set of parameters.  In addition to the above, we will study<br/>  various questions on the existence of symbolic extensions in smooth<br/>  systems. <br/><br/><br/>  We propose to study aspects of the orbit structure of non-linear<br/>  smooth dynamical systems.  Our particular emphasis will be on three<br/>  dimensional systems whose orbits return infinitely often to an<br/>  embedded transverse surface.  These systems occur in models which<br/>  arise in many fields of science from Biology to Physics and even<br/>  Economics. For instance, they include the problems of general forced<br/>  oscillations and the Newtoninan motion of three bodies in a plane.<br/>  Considering the so-called first return map to the embedded surface<br/>  we are led to study the iterations of smooth transformations<br/>  (mappings) of a surface to itself.  There are special motions called<br/>  homoclinic motions (first discovered and named by Poincare in the<br/>  three body problem) which are known to produce a rich, interesting,<br/>  and complicated orbit structure.  In particular, typical homoclinic<br/>  motions imply the existence of infinitely many unstable periodic<br/>  orbits and other orbits which behave in an erratic and unpredictable<br/>  way.  It is now known that in many cases such systems can be studied<br/>  by comparing them to statistical objects such as the random flipping<br/>  of a weighted coin.  This gives rise to so-called ""symbolic models""<br/>  whose orbit structure can be understood.  Our research concerns the<br/>  types of symbolic systems which can occur in modeling various smooth<br/>  systems.  including the estimation of certain numerical quantities<br/>  called ""entropy"" and ""dimension"" which can be used to quantify<br/>  different levels of complicated motion.<br/><br/>"

Resonances are<br/>discrete scattering data for non-compact manifolds analogous to the<br/>eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a compact manifold; the inverse resonance<br/>problem will be investigated in the contexts of conformal and<br/>asymptotically flat geometries, and invariants such as the determinant will<br/>be studied. Nonlinear dispersive equations with singular initial data may<br/>be viewed, via the inverse scattering method, as linearized flows for the<br/>scattering data of a very singular potential. We hope to extend the inverse<br/>scattering picture for the KdV and mKdV equations to such singular data and<br/>obtain greater insight into these dynamical systems--by constructing the<br/>flow on Hilbert spaces of initial data which are singular but very natural<br/>from a dynamical point of view.  <br/><br/>Inverse spectral theory is the mathematical discipline that<br/>underlies important applications of mathematics to medical imaging,<br/>geophysical prospection, non-destructive testing, and many other areas.<br/>In these applications, properties of a physical<br/>system (a human body, the earth, or an industrial material) are <br/>deduced from its response to externally imposed stimuli (electromagnetic<br/>radiation, seismic waves, or ultrasound). The properties deduced may <br/>loosely be described as the ""geometry"" of the system and its response <br/>to external stimuli the ""spectral data"" (or ""normal<br/>modes""). A deep result of the study of completely integrable systems is <br/>that certain physical phenomena,  such as the propagation of waves in<br/>shallow water, can be solved using an associated inverse spectral problem.<br/>Thus advances in inverse spectral theory lead to a better understanding of<br/>how such nonlinear waves propagate.  The impact of this project will be <br/>twofold: first, it will elucidate, by studying carefully chosen geometric <br/>contexts, the relation between speectrum and geometry.

Many new methods of constructing complete<br/>embedded minimal surfaces have recently been found; in place of a<br/>dearth of examples just a few years ago, we now have a quite<br/>varied collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A<br/>basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them<br/>into families with common properties and understood<br/>limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that<br/>combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of<br/>geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,<br/>notably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will<br/>attack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one<br/>heliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk<br/>surface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes?  Of<br/>what families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same<br/>time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal<br/>surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass<br/>representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully<br/>documented, and useful as a research tool.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to<br/>biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;<br/>indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their<br/>foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some<br/>or several of its features in the expression we witness.  At its<br/>base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we<br/>search for principles in science that can be formulated as<br/>extremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of<br/>optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation.  This<br/>leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions<br/>of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in<br/>physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,<br/>the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating<br/>droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications<br/>range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of<br/>stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many<br/>other optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we<br/>do not have much general information about solutions to the<br/>equation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a<br/>wide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and<br/>which we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model<br/>problem, enriching our understanding of all optimization<br/>problems.<br/>"

These results are expected to have<br/>applications to such problems as the local CR embedding problem, local<br/>deformations of CR structures, characterizing domains on which the<br/>tangential Cauchy-Riemann complex is solvable, regularity of maps between CR<br/>manifolds, and the existence of local frames for CR vector bundles.<br/><br/>Non-technical description:<br/><br/>The geometry of complex manifolds (geometric objects in which complex<br/>numbers instead of real numbers can be used as coordinates) has recently<br/>begun to play a surprisingly important role in both mathematics and physics.<br/>For example, in string theory, physicists postulate that the fundamental<br/>particles of matter are actually ""quantum strings"" that vibrate inside<br/>sub-microscopic complex manifolds called Calabi-Yau manifolds.  The<br/>principal analytic tool for studying complex manifolds is the Cauchy-Riemann<br/>equations, a system of partial differential equations that characterizes,<br/>among other things, those functions that have complex derivatives.  When one<br/>studies surfaces within complex manifolds (such as the ""branes"" that arise<br/>in string theory), the Cauchy-Riemann equations need to be replaced by a<br/>much more complicated system called the ""tangential Cauchy-Riemann<br/>equations,"" which we are just beginning to understand.  This proposal will<br/>develop new techniques for studying some deep analytic questions surrounding<br/>the solvability of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are<br/>expected to be of fundamental importance in understanding the geometry and<br/>analysis of surfaces in complex manifolds.<br/><br/>"

The first one, counting<br/>manifolds, is in a sense a continuous analog of asymptotic group theory.  <br/>The guiding line is to convert finiteness results about locally symmetric<br/>manifolds, which follow from rigidity phenomenon and arithmeticity, to<br/>concrete quantitative statements. It is closely related to some central<br/>questions in mathematics such as the congruence subgroup problem, and to<br/>the remarkable finiteness theorem of Borel and Prasad, and it has<br/>applications in Riemannian geometry, number theory and theoretical<br/>physics. This project continues earlier work of the P.I. and joint work of<br/>the P.I. with Burger, Lubotzky and Mozes. The second main project concerns<br/>embeddings of free groups into groups with some geometric structure. This<br/>plays a central role in the study of linear and topological groups (in<br/>particular subgroups of Lie groups over local fields), and impacts some<br/>topics in differential geometry, ergodic theory, geometric group theory,<br/>unitary representations and profinite groups.  One target, which the P.I.<br/>pursues in collaboration with E. Breuillard, is to obtain an effective<br/>version to Tits alternative, a weak version of which was proved by Eskin,<br/>Mozes and Oh, while solving Gromov's exponential growth conjecture. Other<br/>problems are related to the Auslander conjecture. This project is also<br/>related to the study of dense subgroups of analytic Lie groups, and the<br/>``opposite'' problem of classifying the (analytic) metric completions of a<br/>given countable group.<br/><br/>There are several classical finiteness statement concerning locally<br/>symmetric spaces which have been known for more than 30 years, and yet<br/>have no quantitative proofs, or for which the existing estimates are<br/>suboptimal. One example is the classical theorem of Wang (and its strong<br/>version due to Borel and Prasad) about the finiteness of the number of<br/>manifolds with bounded volume; we would like to have good estimates for<br/>this number. Another example is the fact that the fundamental group of a<br/>manifold with finite volume is finitely presented; the size of a minimal<br/>presentation can be estimated in terms of the volume. More generally, we<br/>study relations between the volume of manifolds and their geometric<br/>structure. The second project deals with free subgroups. In his celebrated<br/>1972 paper J. Tits proved that any finitely generated linear group which<br/>is not virtually solvable contains a non-commutative free subgroup. This<br/>result, known today as the Tits alternative, answered a conjecture of Bass<br/>and Serre and was an important step toward the understanding of linear<br/>groups. Any improvement in Tits' theorem has immediate corollaries in<br/>various different fields of mathematics. The P.I. and E.

The two rings <br/>are isomorphic and have natural bases parametrized by the same semigroup <br/>S (the set of dominant coweights of G). However the isomorphism between <br/>the two rings (the Satake transform) does not carry one natural basis  to the <br/>other.

One of the main theorems obtained by <br/>Kapovich, Leeb and Millson is that if a structure constant for the <br/>representation ring of the Langlands' dual group does not vanish then the <br/>corresponding (ie for the same parameter values) structure constant <br/>of the Hecke ring does not vanish. The converse is true for GL(n) <br/>(by classical work of Hall, Green and Klein) but is false for other groups. <br/>One of the main problems Millson intends to work on is the converse problem <br/>for general G i.e if the structure constant for the Hecke ring is nonzero <br/>what can be said about the corresponding structure constant (or related <br/>structure constants) for the representation ring.<br/><br/><br/>        Millson's work began with one of the first theorems of high-school<br/>geometry - the theorem that three positive real numbers a,b,c are the <br/>side-lengths of a triangle in the plane if and only if they satisfy the<br/>""triangle inequalities"", that is, each of a,b,c is less than or equal<br/>the sum of the other two. It is a natural problem to try to give  conditions <br/>on three isometry classes of geodesic segments in any homogeneous geometry <br/>that are necessary and sufficient in order that one can assemble them into<br/>a triangle. In the case of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries a geodesic<br/>segment is determined up to isometry by its length and three geodesic<br/>segments can be assembled into a triangle if and only if the three lengths<br/>satisfy the above triangle inequalities. However for many examples (e.g the <br/>noncompact symmetric spaces of rank r larger than 1) geodesic segments are <br/>parametrized up to isometry by elements in a simplicial cone of dimension r. <br/>One should think of a point in this cone as a ""vector-valued length"".

I plan<br/>to study seven areas in which I have obtained prior results, and where<br/>continued work is likely to yield new and useful mathematics. [1] When <br/>a flow converges, it is valuable to study the stability of its limit, in<br/>order to improve our global understanding of the dynamics of flows. [2] If<br/>a flow fails to converge but behaves in a nonsingular way, one can still<br/>study the dynamics of this collapse by classifying the asymptotic behavior<br/>of nearby solutions. [3] In most cases, a flow does become singular; so it<br/>is of paramount importance (particularly in regard to Hamilton's program<br/>to resolve Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture) to develop a better<br/>classification of singularities. [4] The basic method of studying<br/>singularities is the construction of a sequence of parabolic dilations<br/>(blow-ups). To take limits of these solutions, one must obtain (partial)<br/>injectivity radius estimates by various means. [5] The most powerful (but<br/>perhaps most difficult) way to obtain such injectivity radius estimates<br/>would be to study and extend existing Harnack estimates of the type<br/>pioneered by Li and Yau and further developed by Hamilton. [6] It is <br/>also useful to study the asymptotic behavior and stability of parabolic<br/>dilations at certain model singularities (a method which has been very<br/>fruitful in studying the mean curvature flow). [7] Further information<br/>about singularities can be obtained by constructing and studying solitons:<br/>self-similar solutions that often arise as limits of blow-ups. Moreover,<br/>Kaehler Ricci solitons have interesting connections with complex geometry<br/>and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/><br/>Geometric evolution studies the way an<br/>object's shape changes. In some cases, such as the mean curvature flow and<br/>porous media flow, the motivation is to model certain physical phenomena<br/>such as the motion of an interface in forming metallic alloys, the shape<br/>of a thin film of highly viscous oil, or the flow of oil in shale. In<br/>other cases, the goal is to improve the shape of an object, either to find<br/>optimal (most efficient) shapes, or else to help mathematicians recognize<br/>and classify geometric objects. My own research is part of a large program<br/>to resolve one of the most compelling open questions in mathematics: the<br/>desire to understand and classify all possible 3-dimensional shapes. But<br/>regardless of whether their motivation comes from material science or pure<br/>mathematics, all geometric evolution problems have much in common; so that<br/>the field benefits from rich cross-fertilization. In particular, ideas and<br/>techniques that are developed for any of these highly nonlinear problems<br/>are usually quickly adaptable to related applications.<br/>"

The goal is to break new ground in this area of mathematics by proposing and solving new problems and, at the same time, devising a substantial research program for further investigation. Path and loop spaces over a Riemannian manifold are naturally equipped with the basic ingredients for an analytic theory, namely, the Wiener measure and a differentiable structure. These are important infinite dimensional mathematical and physical models. The PI will study the following problems concerning these models: (1) Integration by parts formula for manifolds with the Neumann boundary conditions (adiabatic case); (2) Logarithmic Sobolev and related inequalities for simply-connected manifolds; (3) Couplings of Brownian motions on manifolds, especially the problem of maximal couplings; (4) Infinite dimensional mass transportation problems related to the Wiener measure. <br/> The importance of mathematical objects, such as path and loop spaces over Riemannian manifolds, has been recognized by mathematicians and physicists for quite some time. The need for their study is motivated by a variety of problems in applicable mathematics and theoretical and applied physics. A better understanding of these models from the mathematical as well as from the physical points of view will contribute to our current knowledge in these two fields. The practical aspects of these investigations will become significant in the future development of mathematical and physical sciences. <br/>"

Blaine Lawson, Jr.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with the study of cycles, residues,<br/>boundaries and differential characters.  The proposal has several<br/>interrelated parts.  The first concerns the groups of algebraic<br/>cycles and cocycles on a projective variety $X$.  The aim is to<br/>relate these groups to the global structure of $X$.  The<br/>investigator has, with others, established a theory of homology<br/>type for algebraic varieties based on the homotopy groups of<br/>cycles spaces. This theory will be used to study concrete<br/>questions about algebraic spaces.  Implications for real<br/>algebraic geometry will be explored.  Striking onnections to<br/>universal constructions in topology which emerged in prior<br/>research will also be investigated. A second part of the proposal<br/>concerns cycles which bound complex subvarieties in a projective<br/>manifold.  Several new conjectures relate these cycles to<br/>approximation theory, pluripotential theory, and the projective<br/>spectrum of Banach graded algebras.  A third area of the proposal<br/>concerns the study of singularities and characteristic<br/>forms. This subject includes a generalization of Chern-Weil<br/>theory which gives canonical homologies between singularities of<br/>bundle maps and characteristic forms. It includes a useful<br/>analytic tool -- geometric atomicity -- which will be studied,<br/>and it yields a new approach to Morse Theory. Applications<br/>relating singularities to global geometry remain to be<br/>investigated. The forth part of the proposal concerns sparks and<br/>spark complexes. This recently developed framework for the study<br/>of differential characters has yielded interesting<br/>generalizations which extend Deligne cohomology and arithmetic<br/>Chow groups. They are essentially secondary invariants which<br/>mediate between cycles and smooth data. Further development of<br/>the theory and its application to the study of cycles is<br/>proposed. A fifth area is concerned with special cycles in<br/>geometry, in particular Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau<br/>manifolds, and associative and Cayley cycles in $G_2$ and<br/>Spin$_7$ spaces. These latter subjects relate to mirror symmetry<br/>conjectures and to M-theory in Physics as well as many areas of<br/>geometry and algebra. This project will also be concerned with<br/>student development, including an undergraduate educational<br/>effort aimed at fostering mathematical independence and<br/>developing interactive enviornments.<br/><br/>A concept of central importance in geometry is that of a<br/>``cycle''.  In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the<br/>simultaneous solution of a system of polynomial equations. In<br/>differential geometry they arise in many ways: as the large scale<br/>solutions of certain differential equations, and as the level<br/>sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.  Curves and<br/>surfaces in space are simple examples.  Cycles with a particular<br/>geometry also play a fundamental role in modern physical theories<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with the study of cycles across this<br/>broad spectrum. In the algebraic setting cycles have been related<br/>to fundamental large-scale geometry of their surrounding<br/>space. This discovery has revealed surprizing and important<br/>relationships between spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental<br/>constructions in algebraic topology and has led to new insights<br/>in both fields.  This work will be continued.<br/><br/>Another area of investigation concerns cycles which form the<br/>boundary of subsets with special geometric structure.  They<br/>represent non-linear versions of classical boundary value<br/>problems in analysis. Such questions arise in many contexts.<br/>Recently the proposer has formulated conjectures relating certain<br/>important classes of such cycles to questions in approximation<br/>theory and Banach algebras. Successful resolution should produce<br/>significant new insights in several fields of mathematics.<br/><br/>A third area of study concerns a mathematical apparatus developed<br/>by the proposer to detect subtle relationships between cycles and<br/>the global structure of the space they live in.  This apparatus<br/>encompasses some of the most effective tools historically<br/>developed for this purpose, and it is much more general.

The connection between the medial axis<br/>and conformal maps may also lead to new ideas for studying<br/>applications in three dimensions (where conformal mappings do not<br/>exist, but maps based on the medial axis still do). Three<br/>dimensional problems are the most important for applications, but<br/>our understanding lags far behind the two dimensional case, so<br/>new two dimensional ideas which generalize to higher dimensions<br/>are important.<br/>"

Using a decomposition theorem of<br/>Biran, this implies several new kinds of symplectic intersection<br/>phenomena for compact Kahler manifolds. The goal of the first<br/>project is to study these new intersection results which suggest<br/>that many basic symplectic properties of a compact Kahler<br/>manifold are determined by the Biran decompositions it<br/>admits. The second project is a joint effort with V.L. Ginzburg<br/>and B.  Gurel. It involves the construction of a generalized<br/>version of Hamiltonian Floer homology in which periodic orbits in<br/>different homotopy classes are allowed to interact via a<br/>generalized Floer differential that counts perturbed holomorphic<br/>curves with punctures. The construction is motivated by the<br/>Symplectic Field Theory of Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The<br/>resulting theory should also have a rich algebraic structure, as<br/>well as a variety of applications including new calculations of<br/>the Hofer-Zehnder capacity for weakly-exact symplectic<br/>manifolds. The third project is a program to prove a conjecture<br/>which asserts the existence of periodic orbits on all level sets<br/>near a nondegenerate symplectic critical submanifold of a<br/>Hamiltonian. This is a generalization of some similar conjectures<br/>of Arnold which concern periodic orbits of a charged particle<br/>moving in a magnetic field.

Such systems include<br/>planets and satellites moving under their mutual gravitational<br/>attraction, a charged particle moving in an electro-magnetic<br/>field, and the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid. These<br/>motions are often quite complex and one way to begin to<br/>understand their global behavior is to look for repeating<br/>patterns, i.e., periodic orbits. While most Hamiltonian flows<br/>have many periodic orbits, it is usually a difficult problem to<br/>establish their existence at a fixed energy level. This problem<br/>is a central theme in the study of Hamiltonian flows and, in<br/>modern times, has been shown to be deeply related to the shape of<br/>the space on which the flow is defined. The projects in this<br/>proposal study various aspects of this relation. In the first two<br/>projects we use Hamiltonian flows to define and compute<br/>symplectic invariants. The last project involves the construction<br/>of a new symplectic invariant which should lead to new existence<br/>results for periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows which describe<br/>the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field.<br/><br/><br/>"

T. Yau conjectured that the existence of <br/>Kaehler metrics with constant scalar curvature is related to the stability of <br/>the underlying polarized manifold. In recent years, striking progress has <br/>been made in this direction. In 1997, G. Tian proved that any <br/>Kaehler-Einstein manifold with positive scalar curvature is K-Stable. In<br/>2001, S. K. Donaldson proved that an algebraic manifold with discrete <br/>automorphism group and Kaehler metric of constant scalar curvature is Chow stable.<br/>Very recently, in a joint work with G. Tian, the proposer proved that <br/>the existence of Kaehler metrics of constant scalar curvature implies Semi-K<br/>Stability of the K energy with respect to the given cohomology class. <br/>Inspired by these results, the proposer wants to study a network of problems <br/>centered around the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics (which includes <br/>constant scalar curvature metric as a special case), stability of polarized Kaehler <br/>manifold, and other related problems. The main ideas of solving these problems<br/>consist of improving regularity for geodesics in the space of Kaehler metrics in <br/>the sense of T. Mabuchi, of understanding the long-time existence of the Calabiflow, <br/>and of the convergence of the Kaehler-Ricci flow. These ideas are related to different <br/>mathematical fields but the proposer believes that they are all very promising to solve the Conjecture of  Yau (in particular to solve the problem of the existence of Kaehler-Einstein <br/>metrics on Fano manifold). The proposer is going to work on the problems through <br/>these ideas.<br/><br/>The problem of the existence of Kaehler metrics of constant<br/>scalar curvature, being the key problem in differential geometry, has <br/>strong impact to other fields of sciences like physics. According to Albert<br/>Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of <br/>space-time. Thus the research in differential geometry is crucially important in <br/>physics and cosmology. The research proposed also has impact in string theory, <br/>which is the theory of unifying all four basic forces of the Nature. The <br/>proposer's work, together with the works of other mathematicians and physicists, <br/>helps in understanding our Universe.<br/>"

Using a decomposition theorem of<br/>Biran, this implies several new kinds of symplectic intersection<br/>phenomena for compact Kahler manifolds. The goal of the first<br/>project is to study these new intersection results which suggest<br/>that many basic symplectic properties of a compact Kahler<br/>manifold are determined by the Biran decompositions it<br/>admits. The second project is a joint effort with V.L. Ginzburg<br/>and B.  Gurel. It involves the construction of a generalized<br/>version of Hamiltonian Floer homology in which periodic orbits in<br/>different homotopy classes are allowed to interact via a<br/>generalized Floer differential that counts perturbed holomorphic<br/>curves with punctures. The construction is motivated by the<br/>Symplectic Field Theory of Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The<br/>resulting theory should also have a rich algebraic structure, as<br/>well as a variety of applications including new calculations of<br/>the Hofer-Zehnder capacity for weakly-exact symplectic<br/>manifolds. The third project is a program to prove a conjecture<br/>which asserts the existence of periodic orbits on all level sets<br/>near a nondegenerate symplectic critical submanifold of a<br/>Hamiltonian. This is a generalization of some similar conjectures<br/>of Arnold which concern periodic orbits of a charged particle<br/>moving in a magnetic field. The first step is to construct a<br/>Floer-type invariant for the underlying variational<br/>principle. Once it is rigorously defined, this should quickly<br/>lead to many new existence results.

Such systems include<br/>planets and satellites moving under their mutual gravitational<br/>attraction, a charged particle moving in an electro-magnetic<br/>field, and the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid. These<br/>motions are often quite complex and one way to begin to<br/>understand their global behavior is to look for repeating<br/>patterns, i.e., periodic orbits. While most Hamiltonian flows<br/>have many periodic orbits, it is usually a difficult problem to<br/>establish their existence at a fixed energy level. This problem<br/>is a central theme in the study of Hamiltonian flows and, in<br/>modern times, has been shown to be deeply related to the shape of<br/>the space on which the flow is defined. The projects in this<br/>proposal study various aspects of this relation. In the first two<br/>projects we use Hamiltonian flows to define and compute<br/>symplectic invariants.

It can be used to understand how a geometric structure evolves<br/>to a more canonical one or the union of canonical structures. In most <br/>cases, there<br/>is a tension field which governs the evolution. The most notable cases <br/>are the harmonic<br/>map flow, the Ricci flow, the mean curvature flow, the Gaussian <br/>curvature flow, and the<br/>inverse mean curvature flow. The long time existence and asymptotic <br/>behavior of the geometric<br/>structure has revealed deep understanding of geometry and topology. Even <br/>short time existence<br/>have immediate consequence of smoothing out the structure. For example, <br/>the short time existence of the<br/>Ricci flow for complete manifolds with bounded curvature provides <br/>smoothing effect  to<br/>approximate the metric by metrics with bound covariant derivatives of <br/>curvature.<br/>All these geometric flows have many common features, most notable is the <br/>fundamental role<br/>of solitary solutions of the flow. It gives strong understanding of <br/>singularity of the nonlinear<br/>system and lead to good estimates: like the Li-Yau-Hamilton estimate <br/>which play important<br/>roles on singularity formations. While working on the Ricci flows, there <br/>are constant insight by<br/>working on the mean curvature flow and other geometric flows, and vice <br/>versa. The works of<br/>Huisken and Sinestrari will be important for this purpose. And so is the <br/>work of Huisken-Ilmanen<br/>on the inverse mean curvature flow. The most recent breakthrough of <br/>Perelman will of course be the central piece<br/>of discussion for the whole project. Not only that we like to make sure <br/>the whole program of<br/>geometrization for three manifolds, but also we like to strengthen and <br/>apply the technique to various<br/>important geometric situation: the Ricci flow for compact Kaehler <br/>manifolds with positive Chern<br/>class, and to four dimensional manifolds. Note that the recent work of  <br/>Cao-Chen-Zhu has<br/>already pointed to the importance of the argument of Perelman in the <br/>Kaehler case. Perelman's<br/>most recent work in the Kaehler case made further progress. We hope to <br/>incorporate it in a bigger picture of<br/>Kaehler geometry. When one studies the Kaehler geometry, a very <br/>important ingredient to understand<br/>Mirror geometry for Calabi-Yau manifolds is the study of special <br/>Lagrangian submanifolds. This<br/> has been pursued by M.- T. Wang using the Lagrangian mean curvature flow .<br/>The existence and regularity of such submanifolds will play important <br/>roles in the future of geometry. As<br/>was mentioned above, the inverse mean curvature flow will also be <br/>important for our discussions as it was<br/>demonstrated by the work of  Huisken-Ilmanen in solving the Riemannian <br/>Penrose conjecture. In terms<br/>of general relativity, Bray, Huisken, M.-T. Wang and Yau will be very <br/>much involved in the analysis of<br/>various flows that appeared. (Huisken-Yau used the mean curvature flow <br/>to study center of gravity,  Bray<br/>studied the Penrose conjecture) As a whole, there will be close <br/>cooperation and many students will be<br/>trained under this joint program.

The primary project involves the use of symplectic<br/>geometry tools to investigate the differential topology of four<br/>dimensional spaces.  The long range goal is to shed light on the<br/>classification for smooth, four dimensional spaces, this one of the<br/>outstanding open problems in low dimensional topology.  As there is<br/>considerable circumstantial evidence for a symplectic geometry role in<br/>the story, the immediate plan is to probe the symplectic geometry<br/>connections to the subject.  The first of the mathematical physics<br/>projects aims to construct an equivariant Fredholm setting for a Dirac<br/>operator on the loop space of a manifold.

In this project, techniques of Lorentzian and<br/>Riemannian geometry will be used to attack certain problems<br/>pertaining to such spacetimes, as well as some problems<br/>concerning new developments in the theory of black holes. One of<br/>the specific aims of this project is to continue development of<br/>an approach to establishing positivity of mass for asymptotically<br/>hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds (with spherical conformal<br/>infinity) which does not require spin assumption. This approach,<br/>which makes use of the brane action introduced by Witten and Yau<br/>in their work on the AdS/CFT correspondence, may also be useful<br/>in settling some positive mass conjectures for asymptotically<br/>anti-de Sitter spacetimes with toroidal topology at infinity.

The classical definition of<br/>a black hole, though mathematically elegant, is problematic in<br/>practice (especially for numerical studies) in that it requires<br/>knowing the full future evolution of spacetime all the way to<br/>infinity.

Labutin, University of California, Santa Barbara<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/><br/>The project is dedicated to investigation of main elliptic<br/>partial differential  equations arising in<br/>Riemannian geometry, namely equations with the Monge-Ampere operator,<br/>Laplacian, and conformal Laplacian. The central question for the project<br/>is the analysis of the singular sets arising in geometric problems.<br/>It is  proposed to approach several problems  using ideas<br/>from nonlinear potential theory. Let us describe the problems.<br/>The singular Yamabe problem originates in the work of<br/>Loewner and Nirenberg, and Schoen and<br/>Yau. It consists of finding conformal deformation of the<br/>metric in a domain of a Riemannian manifold (unit sphere is the model <br/>case)<br/>to a complete metric with  a constant scalar curvature.<br/>The question is how to describe the domains for which it is possible.<br/>In the case of the conformal deformation to the constant negative<br/>scalar curvature in the unit sphere   it was recently solved by PI.<br/>The answer is that it is possible if and only if  the complement<br/>is not thin in the potential theory sense. This means that the<br/>Wiener-type test with  a certain capacity holds at any point of<br/>the complement. In the case of the conformal deformation to the zero <br/>scalar curvature<br/>there is a strong evidence that the criterion will be  the polarity of<br/>of the complement with respect to another capacity.<br/>PI intends to verify it. Can one extend the results<br/>from the sphere  to general closed manifolds?<br/>Under what additional assumptions?<br/>Can potential theory  ideas contribute<br/>to the deformation to positive scalar curvature?<br/>Another  group of questions is related to the<br/>Liouville theorems on negatively curved<br/>Cartan-Hadamard manifolds.  The  main  problem is easy to state. Does <br/>any such  manifold<br/>of dimension greater than  three with uniform  upper negative sectional <br/>curvature bound<br/>support a nontrivial bounded harmonic function?<br/>PI believes that potential theory ideas<br/>can contribute to better understanding<br/>of this question.  The solvability of the Dirichlet problem<br/>at infinity  (and hence the failure of the Liouville theorem)<br/>for strongly negatively curved Cartan-Hadamard manifolds<br/>was established in the works by<br/>Sullivan, Anderson, Schoen, and Ancona.<br/>There are certain similarities with the Dirichlet problem<br/>in irregular domains in<br/>the flat space, where<br/>potential theory ideas are proved to be useful.<br/>Validity of Liouville theorems in a domain<br/>is  known to be equivalent to the polarity of<br/>the complement with respect to the classical<br/>electrostatic  capacity. Can one establish a similar relation for<br/>the manifolds?  Is curvature the adequate<br/>characteristic of the metric for such problems?<br/>Results of Grigoryan and Saloff-Coste<br/>show, that for a different but related question of the validity of<br/>Harnack inequality, the correct language is the Riemannian volume growth<br/>and local Poincare-type  inequalities rather than the nonnegative <br/>curvature.<br/>It is certain that the new methods will have to be developed for<br/>Liouville theorems. The main goal of the project is investigation of<br/>the described problems  using the techniques which have not been <br/>applied to such problems<br/>before.  These are the techniques of nonlinear potential theory.<br/><br/><br/>The area of interaction between nonlinear partial differential equations<br/>and geometry is undergoing a strong development. However, the current <br/>research<br/>is not primarily aimed at the questions proposed in the project. The  <br/>project<br/>is focused on the application of the methods from<br/>technically difficult area of nonlinear partial differential equations,<br/>namely nonlinear potential theory, to several concrete problems about<br/>singularities arising in Riemannian geometry. Previously these  methods <br/>were not<br/>systematically applied and developed in such context. More complete  <br/>understanding of<br/>potential theoretic methods in geometric analysis will be  of great <br/>help in<br/>detailing the way to better understanding of singularities in geometric <br/>problems.<br/>Better understanding of singularites of geometric objects leads in its <br/>turn to<br/>progress in problems from theoretical physics, topology and other areas <br/>of mathematics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

There are expected to be other<br/>applications of Floer homology to questions about surgery on<br/>knots. As part of this program, the principal investigator will<br/>complete a thorough investigation of the foundations of<br/>Seiberg-Witten Floer homology. A similar study of the<br/>closely-related instanton Floer homology is at present obstructed<br/>by difficulties stemming from the non-compactness of instanton<br/>moduli spaces. The principal investigator intends to examine<br/>these obstructions with a view towards having a more complete<br/>instanton Floer theory.<br/><br/>Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness.<br/>Its importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by<br/>the French mathematician Poincare, during his investigation of<br/>the laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body<br/>system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to<br/>Newton's laws.  In the past twenty years, topology has seen<br/>applications in questions such as the knotting of proteins and<br/>DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The topology<br/>of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher<br/>dimension, is of particular subtlety.  Through this project, it<br/>is hoped to bring new techniques to bear on outstanding questions<br/>in three-dimensional topology.  These techniques -- gauge theory<br/>and the Seiberg-Witten equations -- originated in physics, where<br/>they had potential application to fundamental questions such as<br/>quark confinement.  They have been an effective tool in the study<br/>of four-dimensional spaces (such as our space-time).  The aim now<br/>is to apply the same techniques to questions in dimension three.<br/>"

The classical theory of harmonic maps deals with<br/>maps between Riemannian manifolds.  More recently, the importance of<br/>considering singular domains and targets has been discovered.  Harmonic map<br/>theory in singular spaces was initiated by Gromov and Schoen and their<br/>analysis of harmonic maps into non-positively curved Riemannian simplicial<br/>complexes combined with Corlette's vanishing theorem is the basis of their<br/>proof of p-adic super-rigidity.  The study of harmonic maps into singular<br/>targets was further generalized by Korevaar and Schoen and independently by<br/>Jost.  Further generalization is to consider singular domains.  In this<br/>project, we study harmonic maps from a simplicial polyhedron to a metric<br/>space of non-positive curvature.  A fundamental question is the regularity<br/>of these maps, and our goal is to show that these maps are smooth enough to<br/>be useful in many applications.  In particular, we hope to bring harmonic<br/>map theory and holomorphic quadratic differentials into the study of<br/>finitely generated groups.  More precisely, we will use harmonic maps from a<br/>two-dimensional simplicial complex to understand finitely generated groups<br/>from their actions on R-trees.   This point of view is important in the<br/>study of combinatorial group theory and three-dimensional topology.<br/>Harmonic maps will also be used to investigate compactifications of the<br/>Teichmuller space of a compact surface.  Finally, the study of minimal<br/>surfaces will be considered as an extension of the generalized harmonic map<br/>theory.  <br/>The proposed work contributes to the basic understanding of geometric<br/>variational problems.  Mathematicians have devoted large effort in<br/>developing variational methods and the successes of these investigations<br/>have laid the foundations of many branches of sience. There is a natural<br/>notion of energy associated to maps between certain spaces and, in this<br/>project, we study its critical points which are called harmonic maps. They<br/>have shown to be extremely useful as an analytic tool in geometry.  The<br/>generalization of harmonic maps between smooth spaces to non-smooth spaces<br/>promises to yield many more applications. We investigate the extent to which<br/>the classical methods in harmonic maps can be carried over to the singular<br/>setting.  The applications of the generalized theory make these questions<br/>relevant to a broad mathematical community.<br/>"

Invited speakers and other<br/>participants include a number of female mathematicians, recent<br/>PhDs, and graduate students.<br/><br/>A manifold is a geometric space in which every point has<br/>neighborhoods that can be identified with Euclidean space of some<br/>dimension.

A common theme of this project, and also of the research of the PI<br/>over the past several years, is the important role of the nodal sets of<br/>solutions to differential equations, or in general the level sets of the<br/>functions involved. The problems discussed in the project involve differential<br/>equations of various types, elliptic, hyperbolic and of mixed type. Some<br/>problems have close connections with other fields in mathematics, including<br/>several complex variables and algebraic geometry. One class of problems that<br/>the PI would continue to work on includes the geometric structure of level sets<br/>of solutions, in particular the nodal sets, the singular sets and the branch<br/>sets. An important part of the study is the investigation of the asymptotic<br/>behavior of solutions near these sets or the asymptotic behavior of these sets<br/>themselves. Another class of problems that the PI would continue to work on<br/>involves the effect of level sets of known functions in the equations on the<br/>properties of solutions.<br/><br/><br/>The problems involving singular sets originate from the material science and the<br/>control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those sets where<br/>singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to problems where they<br/>arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate the singular sets, the<br/>so-called `bad sets'. One of the central tasks is to identify the conditions<br/>under which the singular sets can be controlled and the conditions under which<br/>the singular sets are small. The proposed problems concerning singular sets in<br/>the project are in their simplest forms. They are related to the Erickson's<br/>model for liquid crystals and the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the<br/>superconductivity. The PI believes that the discussion of these mathematical<br/>problems would improve the methods to control the singular sets in various<br/>applications.<br/><br/><br/>"
