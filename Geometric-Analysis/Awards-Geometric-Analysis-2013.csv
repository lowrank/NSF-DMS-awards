The main conjecture in the field relates the existence of such metrics to the stability of the variety in the sense of geometric invariant theory. The proposed research focuses on situations when no extremal metric exists. On the algebro-geometric side the goal is to construct canonical degenerations of the variety and the PI's proposal is to use filtrations of the homogeneous coordinate ring, in analogy with Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of unstable vector bundles. On the differential geometric side one needs to understand the possible limiting behavior of families of extremal metrics. In general this is much more intricate than the much more thoroughly understood case of Kahler-Einstein metrics, and the PI proposes to first restrict attention to metrics with bounded curvature, and to relate the limiting behavior to filtrations. In the proposal a special emphasis is placed on the construction of new examples of extremal metrics, and the applications of these ideas to other problems in Kahler geometry.<br/><br/>Geometric partial differential equations govern much of the physical world. For example solutions of Einstein's equations are intimately related to our understanding of the universe.  The proposed research studies differential equations related to Einstein's equations and the key question is how the global structure of a space influences the local, analytic properties, such as singularities of the solutions of such equations. Understanding this phenomenon will have applications in physics and the sciences in general."

Principally, the investigator plans to study dynamical and geometric structures of ""higher rank"" systems in these areas. These appear naturally in seemingly quite separate areas, for example in number theory or in studying the spectrum of the Laplacian. The investigator will work on rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and semi-simple Lie groups and their lattices striving to classify such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical hypotheses.  In particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic abelian actions and their cocycles on tori and homogeneous spaces as well as general Cartan actions of rank 2. These special cases provide tests for more general conjectures.  The investigator will also study actions by semi-simple groups and their lattices preserving projective, affine and other geometric structures.  In addition, the investigator will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially those of higher spherical rank) and more general singular spaces and their geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical and group theoretic tools will be used in this research.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and ergodic theory investigate the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time, such as turbulence in a fluid flow. New ideas and concepts such as chaos and fractals have changed our understanding of the world. Dynamics and ergodic theory provide excellent mathematical tools, and have a strong impact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is a highly developed and ancient field in mathematics of amazing vigor.  It studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.  Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, starting with Gauss in the nineteenth century. It is closely linked with physics and other sciences and applied areas such as computer vision. Geometry and dynamics are closely related.  Indeed, important dynamical systems come from geometry, and vice versa geometry provides tools to study dynamical systems. One main goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Important examples of such systems arise from geometry when the space contains many flat subspaces.  Group theory finally enters both dynamics and geometry by studying the group of symmetries of a geometry or dynamical situation, or by investigating the dynamical and geometric behavior of the group of symmetries acting on a space."

Many of these investigations are motivated by the classical study of  the Teichmuller space of hyperbolic (or conformal) structures on a surface. For example, the Hitchin component of the space of (conjugacy classes of) representations of a closed surface group into PSL(n,R) has been shown to have many striking resemblances to Teichmuller space. Prof. Canary, in collaboration with Bridgeman, Labourie and Sambarino, has recently developed a mapping class group invariant metric on each Hitchin component which restricts to the Weil-Petersson metric on the Fuchsian locus. Prof. Canary proposes to investigate the properties of this metric and use it as a tool to understand the geometry of the Hitchin component. More generally, he proposes to study metrics on spaces of Anosov representations of word hyperbolic groups into semi-simple Lie groups. Prof. Canary also proposes to study the topology and geometry of deformation spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The Ending Lamination Theorem provides a classification of the manifolds in these deformation spaces, but as the invariants in this classification are not continuous, it does not provide a parameterization. Recent work has shown that the topology of these spaces has a rich structure and many intriguing questions remain to be studied.<br/><br/><br/>Prof. Canary will study deformation spaces of geometric structures on manifolds. A 2-dimensional manifold is a space which looks locally like the 2-dimensional plane, e.g. the surface of a basketball or a pretzel. A geometric structure gives a way of measuring distances and angles on the manifold. It is natural to then study  spaces of  geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed  manifold. The classical Teichmuller theory studies all hyperbolic geometric structures on a fixed surface.  Teichmuller theory has played a central role in several mathematical fields, e.g. complex analysis and dynamics, as well as in physics, especially in string theory. Similarly, a 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The universe we live in is an example of a 3-dimensional manifold. Professor Canary proposes to study deformation spaces of hyperbolic geometric structures on 3-manifolds. More generally,  Prof. Canary will study  both the geometry and the topology of deformation spaces of  geometric structures arising from representations of groups into semi-simple Lie groups. In addition, Prof. Canary will continue his commitment to undergraduate education, by continuing his involvement with curriculum development in courses using inquiry-based learning techniques, and his work mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors."

One of the main aims of the proposed research is to derive a complete theory for the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves displacing test masses permanently. This will include answering the questions whether there exists such an effect for neutrino radiation as present in binary neutron star mergers and if there is a cosmological memory effect. The goal is to give a detailed geometric-analytic description in the various scenarios and to apply the mathematics to experiments. The PI has already made contributions in this direction in the recent past. The emerging results of the project are expected to answer fundamental physical questions about gravitational radiation, the source objects in astrophysics and the very early period of our universe. Since the pioneering article by D. Christodoulou, where he derived the nonlinear memory effect (also called the Christodoulou effect), it had been an  outstanding problem if electromagnetic fields coupled to the Einstein equations affect this nonlinear phenomenon. The PI with collaborators P. Chen and S.-T. Yau solved the problem, proving that the electromagnetic field in the Einstein-Maxwell (EM) equations enlarges the Christodoulou effect. Working with Christodoulou's geometric-analytic approach for the Einstein vacuum equations and N. Zipser's analysis of the EM equations, the PI, Chen and Yau established novel results and methods in the geometric analysis of the EM equations. The geometric-analytic investigations by Christodoulou as well as by the PI with Chen and Yau allowed the authors to deduce exact solutions describing the related effects precisely and for all data. In particular, the results hold for large data such as binary black hole or binary neutron star mergers. Geometric analysis has since proven to be the most powerful method to tackle these problems. In the study of the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves, null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian geometry play a crucial role.  This is due to the fact that gravitational waves travel along such null hypersurfaces and experiments are performed at null infinity.  Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of the latter has to be understood. D. Christodoulou and S. Klainerman in their work ""The global nonlinear stability of the Minkowski space"" developed new techniques to investigate those. The PI generalized their work and established the borderline case from the point of view of decay of the data. In a research monograph of 300 pages the PI obtained numerous new results that can be applied to other problems in geometry and analysis. The main method and its developments have recently led to the solution of some of the most challenging problems in mathematical physics. The new project will use new ideas from the PI's recent work and it is expected to yield further new results in general relativity (GR), geometry and PDE analysis.    The educational component of the proposal focuses on disseminating knowledge of mathematics, physics and astrophysics as well as historic background to the public. Aiming at the creation of an exhibit at the Museum of Natural History at the PI's home University combining geometry and analysis with astrophysics, the educational project will include student work at undergraduate and graduate levels. Together with the PI and the museum staff, they will  be involved in teaching at high schools working on the project. At public events organized by the museum the PI will collaborate with the museum staff to present activities to enhance learning. Research results will be presented in a simplified way and adapted to the audience. The project is designed as to reach out to a very broad public including minority groups, families with small kids, schools at all levels and will have an appealing component for everyone. Some of the long-lasting impacts will be new activities for high school classes to teach mathematics by introducing concepts of physics combined with history and art.    <br/><br/>The geometric nature of general relativity singles out geometric analysis to be the perfect research field to answer the many physical questions.  The laws of GR are the Einstein equations, linking the curvature of spacetime to its matter content. Exploring these equations will lead to a better understanding of the universe as a whole and of isolated systems such as galaxies, binary black holes or binary neutron stars. To unravel the complex interplay between geometry, analysis and physics is one of the main goals in GR. This project aims to investigate this beautiful interaction. Along the way, the mathematical tools developed promise to bear fruit in the  analysis of the many structurally similar nonlinear PDEs. Through the educational component, the PI's research will also have direct impact in a broader sense via the afore-mentioned activities. The PI will complement the outreach by attending conferences to communicate her results. She will also make her results available via internet and publications."

The principal investigator proposes to analyze a family of problems addressing the study of the space of constant scalar curvature Kaehler surfaces. The projects proposed concern both problems on the local development of singularities, but also the understanding of compact smooth spaces. The principal investigator aims to establish connections between the algebraic geometry aspects of the problems and their counterparts in Kaehler geometry. The resolution of these projects will provide constructions of new examples of constant scalar curvature Kaehler surfaces, or constant scalar curvature almost Kaehler 4-manifolds. In another direction, the principal investigator proposes a series of projects on the relations between estimates of the curvature components, the topological and differential invariants of a 4-orbifold, and existence or non-existence of Einstein metrics. The main approach is via the Seiberg-Witten theory.<br/><br/>The study of the four dimensional spaces has a long history both in mathematics and physics being motivated by the study of the space-time model. In mathematics, there is strong evidence that the four dimensional spaces are very special as they admit infinitely many smooth structures.

In particular, the principal investigator aims to establish new connections among these various fields."

Mathematically, those invariants are typically described as virtual Euler characteristics of some moduli spaces. The wall-crossing phenomenon is related to the presence of real codimension one ""walls"" in the space of parameters, where the invariants jump. In the case of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the walls live in the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the ppropriate Calabi-Yau categories. Similar walls also occur in the theory of representations of quivers and cluster algebras. In mirror symmetry, walls correspond to jumps in the number of pseudo-holomorphic discs bounded by the torus fibers of an SYZ Lagrangian fibration. In supersymmetric gauge theories in physics, the number of BPS states jumps across ""walls of marginal stability"". The Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas invariants thus occur in the physics literature on topics such as moduli spaces of vector ultiplets of 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories and supersymmetric black holes. Since these various wall-crossing formulas look so similar, one can ask for a common formalism. The aim of the FRG is to study the underlying ""wall-crossing structures"" and demonstrate hat the above-mentioned similarities are not coincidental, but rather reflect a deep underlying theory.<br/><br/>It is a frequently encountered situation in mathematics and physics that numerical quantities which in principle depend on various parameters actually are constant for general parameter values (they are ""invariants""), but jump along certain ""walls"" in the parameter space. Wall-crossing formulas describe these ""jumps"" quantitatively. The subject of wall-crossing has recently become a very active one due to its relevance to a number of different areas of mathematics and physics. The aim of this project is to develop the concept of ""wall-crossing structure"" rigorously and apply it to problems both old and new in which wall-crossing formulas appear. The results arising from this project will be in demand by both the mathematics and physics communities. The FRG will also build a research community around this coordinated effort, involving a mix of junior and senior researchers, training opportunities for graduate students, and the rganization of several workshops."

Sormani<br/><br/>The PI will apply Intrinsic Flat convergence between Riemannian manifolds to better understand how close space-like manifolds studied in Mathematical General Relativity approximate the standard well known models.  The Intrinsic Flat distance, first introduced by the PI with Stefan Wenger using methods of Ambrosio-Kirchheim, is particularly well-suited to some questions arising in General Relativity because increasingly thin gravity wells disappear under this convergence.  In joint work with Dan Lee, the PI has shown that spherically symmetric Riemannian manifolds with increasingly small ADM mass converge to Euclidean space in the pointed intrinsic flat sense, and here proposes to generalize this result.  In addition, the PI proposes to develop two new notions of convergence: the first will allow mathematicians to study Lorentzian manifolds directly, and the second will prevent regions from disappearing due to orientation and cancellation.  Both notions are specifically adapted to questions arising in General Relativity.<br/><br/>Einstein's Theory of General Relativity describes how space is curved by gravity.  Even within our own solar system, when computing the trajectories of spacecraft heading to Mars, engineers must take into account the curvature caused by the mass of the planets and the sun. Each planet forms a gravity well.  If the mass of a planet is small, one would like to know in what sense the space around it is almost flat.  In fact, the space around a planet of arbitrarily small mass could be very highly curved (and have a very deep but thin gravity well).  In joint work with Dr. Stefan Wenger, the PI has developed a new means of measuring the closeness between curved spaces and, in joint work with Dr. Dan Lee, she has estimated how close the space around a single perfectly spherical planet is to Euclidean space.  In this project, she will develop tools allowing one to better understand the space around groups of planets which are not perfect spheres: like the ones in our own solar system."

This project considers the way in which these fields interact, particularly the effect on the geometry of locally symmetric spaces. More specifically, the PI will apply insights from number theory, group theory, algebraic geometry, and low dimensional topology to study the geometric and topological properties of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces. Special focus will be placed on lattices acting on real and complex hyperbolic space, where a better understanding of arithmetic lattices can shed light on several open questions about the geometry and topology of finite volume real and complex hyperbolic manifolds. Many well-known properties of 2 and 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds lead to analogous questions in higher dimensions, and it is of significant interest to study which of these properties are peculiar to low dimensions and which remain true for the more enigmatic higher-dimensional spaces.<br/><br/>Geometry and number theory are two of the most classical areas of mathematical study, and the interaction between the two has fascinated mathematicians since ancient times. This relationship lies behind countless great mathematical advances from Euclid's Elements to Gauss to Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Studying this interplay continues to bear deep fruit. Number fields are objects related to solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients (e.g., the rational numbers), and number fields give rise to an infinite family of geometric objects called arithmetic locally symmetric spaces, which lie at the heart of the Langlands program and often parameterize fundamental objects in mathematics and physics. Invariants of these number fields, like the discriminant of a polynomial, and properties of associated symmetry groups lead to deep insight about nature of these geometric spaces. Group theory is one of the most significant assets in the modern study of geometry and number theory, which goes back to Lagrange and Galois's study of the roots of polynomials and their symmetry, and the modern viewpoint originates in Klein's Erlangen program from the 1870s. Recent years have also seen significant applications of the geometry of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces to computer science, information theory, graph theory, and cryptography, and the connections with number theory and group theory are central to many of these applications."

We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the  nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estiimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central  to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to  the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates  features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to  provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly  in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also  for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications.  In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of  this project should have a substantial application to many other  equations of this general type which play important roles in other  parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>Einstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job  of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the  astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every  known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of  view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very  distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational  fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear  system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations  (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein  constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent  PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a  more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact  between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many  advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and  which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the  physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological  scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open  questions in this area."

Symplectic invariants (usually counts of curves of various kinds) are defined using solutions to perturbed systems of equations, and the issues involved in finding coherent perturbations are not yet fully worked out. A main part of this proposal is to continue McDuff?s project with Wehrheim that reworks the traditional approach (via finite dimensional reduction) to this problem. So far, they have resolved the main topological issues, but questions concerning isotropy and how to deal with the lack of smoothness caused by gluing have yet to be worked out in detail, even in the simplest case of closed curves. Once this most basic problem has been dealt with, many important variants of the construction also need reworking, for example what happens when there is a circle symmetry. McDuff also proposes to study a variety of more geometric questions. For example, how does the existence of a very non generic holomorphic curve in a symplectic four manifold affect the other curves in the manifold? How ""bendable"" are symplectic structures: is there a circle action with isolated fixed pointswhose moment map defines a (singular) fibration over a circle?<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry has grown into a very important tool for understanding the structure of manifolds. These are spaces which, like the space-time of physics, locally look like familiar Euclidean space but might have global twisting. As in the recent solution to the Poincare conjecture concerning three dimensional manifolds, it has turned out that instead of looking at plain vanilla manifolds, one should give them extra structure: a metric (which is a way of measuring distance) or perhaps a complex or symplectic structure. The latter two involve making two-dimensional measurements (symplectic structures measure area), and are related by a mysterious mirror symmetry that was first suggested by physicists and recently given various mathematical interpretations. In its eagerness to work with these exciting new ideas from physics, the mathematical community has been using various foundational tools without setting them up with sufficient rigor. This has become a serious problem. Mathematics develops via intuition and imagination, but, because results cannot be verified by experimentation, without careful and valid proofs one is left with mere speculation. This project is largely motivated by the desire to remedy this. It proposes a detailed reworking of basic constructions (from topology and analysis) that allow one to count objects in a consistent way. Once completed, symplectic geometers will be able to move ahead with a sure way to test the correctness of their arguments."

Mathematically, those invariants are typically described as virtual Euler characteristics of some moduli spaces. The wall-crossing phenomenon is related to the presence of real codimension one ""walls"" in the space of parameters, where the invariants jump. In the case of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the walls live in the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the ppropriate Calabi-Yau categories. Similar walls also occur in the theory of representations of quivers and cluster algebras. In mirror symmetry, walls correspond to jumps in the number of pseudo-holomorphic discs bounded by the torus fibers of an SYZ Lagrangian fibration. In supersymmetric gauge theories in physics, the number of BPS states jumps across ""walls of marginal stability"". The Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas invariants thus occur in the physics literature on topics such as moduli spaces of vector ultiplets of 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories and supersymmetric black holes. Since these various wall-crossing formulas look so similar, one can ask for a common formalism. The aim of the FRG is to study the underlying ""wall-crossing structures"" and demonstrate hat the above-mentioned similarities are not coincidental, but rather reflect a deep underlying theory.<br/><br/>It is a frequently encountered situation in mathematics and physics that numerical quantities which in principle depend on various parameters actually are constant for general parameter values (they are ""invariants""), but jump along certain ""walls"" in the parameter space. Wall-crossing formulas describe these ""jumps"" quantitatively. The subject of wall-crossing has recently become a very active one due to its relevance to a number of different areas of mathematics and physics. The aim of this project is to develop the concept of ""wall-crossing structure"" rigorously and apply it to problems both old and new in which wall-crossing formulas appear. The results arising from this project will be in demand by both the mathematics and physics communities. The FRG will also build a research community around this coordinated effort, involving a mix of junior and senior researchers, training opportunities for graduate students, and the rganization of several workshops."

The NSF support will complement the existing funding and will be used to cover some of the travel expenses of the participants based in the United States. The Fields Institute is a major international research center with extensive experience in organizing similar events. The workshop in question focuses on the appearance of modular forms in many different contexts: in the physics of Calabi-Yau manifolds, such as generating functions for certain physical quantities; in the arithmetic of Calabi-Yau manifolds, as part of the general Langlands philosophy in the study of Galois representations of Calabi-Yau varieties defined over number fields; in the structure of geometric invariants on Calabi-Yau varieties, such as Donaldson-Thomas invariants. All of these represent extremely active topics of research, and the workshop aims to synthesize the different points of view brought by each of these perspectives.<br/><br/>Calabi-Yau manifolds play a vital role at the crossroads of mathematics and physics. While they first arose as important objects in geometry, Calabi-Yau manifolds really came to prominence after they appeared naturally in string theory. String theory replaces the traditional notion of the point particle with a small loop of string, moving through space-time. To make string theory compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects six of these dimensions to be a very small ""curled up"" geometric object. These objects are Calabi-Yau manifolds. Their introduction into physics led to a great deal of new mathematics. A crucial property of Calabi-Yau manifolds is that they both have very delicate flatness properties (satisfying so-called Ricci flatness) and they can be defined using systems of polynomials equations. As a result, they can be viewed as both algebro-geometric and arithmetic objects, the latter if the polynomial equations have coefficients in a number field. Intimate connections have been found between the physical, algebro-geometric and artihmetic features of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The goal of this workshop is to explore these relationships, making new connections between researchers with these three different perspectives.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Geometric Analysis programs."

The PI expects that appropriate modifications to the linear problem will allow her to extend their techniques to produce infinitely many new embedded, constant mean curvature hypersurfaces. As a second project, the PI will consider compactness theory for extrinsic biharmonic maps. For sequences of harmonic maps, energy quantization and regularity theory play a key role in establishing the compactness result. The PI intends to show, using comparable results for the biharmonic setting, that the limiting biharmonic map and the maps arising from dilations at concentration points are connected in the image manifold without necks. Finally, the PI will attempt to combine and extend her study of the structure of complete, embedded minimal surfaces with finite topology and the structure of annular minimal surfaces with boundary to understand the structure of complete minimal surfaces with infinite topology. <br/><br/>Solutions to variational problems are critical points for an energy functional and as such are deeply connected with physical phenomenon.

In the setting of Riemann surfaces we study Teichmueller curves, Jacobians with real multiplication, volumes of complex hyperbolic cone manifolds and representations of the braid group developed by Picard, Deligne-Mostow and Thurston.  We also investigate dynamical systems of low entropy, ranging from pseudo-Anosov maps to automorphism of K3 surfaces, via constructions adapted to small Salem numbers and Coxeter groups.

The first project concerns fully nonlinear differential equations in riemannian geometry. Recent work of the principal investigator and R. Harvey on the Dirichlet problem will be continued, and questions concerning singularities and tangents to solutions will be investigated.  Motivation for this study came from the investigators' development of pluripotential theory in calibrated and other geometries, where notions of plurisubharmonic functions, pseudo-convex domains, capacity, etc. were introduced and many basic properties established.  This should have an important impact in calibrated geometry, which in turn plays an important role in M-theory in modern physics.  There should also be applications to symplectic geometry and to p-convexity in Riemannian geometry.  The second part of the proposal concerns the groups of algebraic cycles and cocycles on a projective algebraic variety.  Here the aim is to understand these groups and relate them to the global structure of the variety itself.  The investigator has, with others, established a theory of homology type for algebraic varieties based on the homotopy groups of cycles spaces.  This theory will be applied to concrete questions about algebraic spaces, and implications for real algebraic geometry will be explored.  Striking connections to universal constructions in topology which emerged in prior research will also be probed.  A strongly related part of the proposal concerns cycles which bound holomorphic chains in projective manifolds. Characterizations in terms of projective linking numbers and quasi-plurisubharmonic functions will be studied.  This will involve analyzing the structure of projective hulls, a concept analogous to polynomial hulls, which has been introduced by the investigator and is of independent interest.  Projective hulls are related to approximation theory, pluripotential theory, and the spectrum of Banach graded algebras.  The final area concerns analytic approaches to differential characters, and their generalizations, developed by the PI.  The central objects mediate between cycles and smooth data. In the complex category this involves an analytic study of Deligne cohomology.  It yields invariants for bundles and foliations, and retrieves the classical Abel-Jacobi mappings.  Variational methods will be brought to bear on the study and connect it to the 1-Laplacian and the theory of minimal hypersurfaces.  <br/><br/>A concept of central importance in geometry is that of a ""cycle."" In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the simultaneous solution of a system of polynomial equations. In differential geometry cycles arise in many ways: as the large scale solutions of certain differential equations, and as the level sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings. Curves and surfaces in space are simple examples.  Cycles with a particular geometry (discovered by the investigator and his collaborators) play a fundamental role in modern physical theories This project will also be concerned with graduate student development.  Students will be part of the research team. There will also be an undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering mathematical independence."

The first project is about understanding the ways in which Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds can degenerate in families. Building on his previous work, the PI proposes to understand these degenerations, to explore the structure of the possible limit spaces, and to apply these results to attack a conjecture of Kontsevich-Soibelman, Gross-Wilson and Todorov related to the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow picture of mirror symmetry for hyperkahler manifolds. In the second project the PI will study the geometry of Hermitian manifolds using the Chern-Ricci flow, an extension of the Kahler-Ricci flow to all complex manifolds. This flow is intimately related to the complex structure of the manifold and will be used to widen our understanding of non-Kahler compact complex surfaces. The third project is centered on Donaldson's program to extend Yau's solution of the Calabi Conjecture in Kahler geometry to symplectic four-manifolds. This would provide a new and powerful analytic tool to construct symplectic forms on closed symplectic four-manifolds as solutions of a highly nonlinear PDE, and would allow to solve basic open questions in symplectic topology, such as: given a compact almost-complex four-manifold, when are there compatible symplectic forms?<br/><br/>The proposed research is in the field of Geometric Analysis. In this area one studies problems of geometric nature (for example how a high-dimensional space, called a manifold, is curved), using the tools of analysis and differential equations. One of the main objects of study in the proposed research are Calabi-Yau manifolds. According to string theorists, our physical space-time is not four-dimensional but rather ten-dimensional. The remaining six dimensions are extremely small, so that we don't normally perceive them, but are crucial for understanding elementary particles. These six dimensions together form a tiny geometric space, which is a Calabi-Yau manifold, and which captures essential features of particle physics. Understanding its geometry would allow us to understand how particles are created and how they interact, and is one of the main current problems in mathematical physics."

The PI will study the pluri-closed flow, a new curvature flow which arises from complex geometry. He will develop its analytic theory and singularity formation. It has been found that there is a deep connection between this flow and the renormalization group flow of the nonlinear sigma model with B-field. The PI will explore this connection further and give new mathematical insights for the duality in the string theory. For the Einstein equation, the PI will focus mainly on the existence of its solutions and behavior of its singular solutions. The case for dimension 4 is particularly interesting. Self-dual metrics in dimension 4 will be also studied. They can be used to study the geometry and topology of underlying spaces. The PI will also study how the symplectic flow develops finite-time singularity in dimension 4 as well as other fundamental problems in  symplectic geometry. The problems include isotopy of symplectic surfaces and its applications to classifying symplectic 4-manifolds. The PI will also continue his construction of new invariants for symplectic manifolds which admit a Hamiltonian S^1-action. These invariants are constructed by studying the Yang-Mills equation coupled with Cauchy-Riemann equation. These invariants and their extensions are inspired by the topological  field theories in mathematical physics and provide new mathematical foundations for physical theories.<br/><br/> <br/>Problems in this project arose naturally from the attempts to understanding nonlinear differential equations from geometry and physics. These equations involve curvature and include Ricci flow, static Einstein equation. They played a fundamental role in understanding of nature through mathematical means. They also have found many deep applications in geometry and topology, such as the topology of low dimensional spaces. The resolution of these problems will provide mathematical foundations for some physical theories and will have profound applications to long-standing mathematical problems. Most natural phenomena are nonlinear and possess singular behaviors. These are reflected in possible singular solutions to the curvature equations which describe those phenomena. It is still challenging to have a complete mathematical understanding of these singular solutions. This project will address some of these basic problems."

Define the deRham coHomotopy to  be the cohomology of the linearized deRham complex defined as  follows: first construct a resolution of the deRham algebra (A,d).  This is a differential algebra map of a free differential graded   commutative algebra (T,d) to the deRham algebra (A,d)   inducing a bijection on cohomology.The  linearized complex  is that induced on the generators [or indecomposables] of T by its  differential. This deRham Cohomotopy can be related to ordinary  homotopy for simply connected spaces and to algebraic K theory  of associative algebras using spaces with contractible universal  covers. The  concrete proof that this recipe is meaningful is the key  non-trivial point of  deRham Topology and to the applications  of this proposal. It is based on developing  explicitly the nonlinear  notion of homotopy between maps of differential algebras. One obtains  an illuminated picture of algebraic structures and maps between them  that closely resembles that of maps between cell complexes and  fibrations in usual topology. Thus one may analyze the theory of  algebraic objects defined by any number of multilinear operations with  j inputs and k outputs for j and k positive.In one envisaged set of  applications mathematical models in geometry and analysis that  involve infinitely many degrees of freedom and nonlinear structures,  finite dimensional approximating models  are constructed with  coherent mappings between the different levels of approximations.  The Hodge star operator [which associates to a linear subspace its  orthogonal complement] is not immediately amenable to this method. Thus the proposal also focuses on several  algebraic structures like  string theories and geometric structures like singularities in open and  closed strings particular to manifolds in order to finesse the  Hodge Star difficulty.<br/><br/>Some questions are linear problems. The quantitative answer depends  linearly on the data of the  problem. There are good techniques for these  problems. Nonlinear problems like the mathematical  models of ocean currents, flows of oil in a reservoir  and the weather  are   much more difficult to  get a grip on mathematically and computationally. The proposal claims that a technique of nonlinear topology holds some  promise to give a new  technique for treating quite general nonlinear  mathematical models of physical processes. The technique will be easy  to apply by offering finite models approximating nonlinear problems. The  likelihood these models will fit with reality and have predictive value is  enhanced because their derivation is based on the underlying  mathematical structure of the nonlinearities."

The proposal describes several areas  that the PI will investigate using quasiconformal mappings as a primary tool. The first is the iteration theory of complex analytic functions on the plane.  The PI has previously used quasiconformal methods to solve a number of problems in the field and plans to refine these techniques to attack several remaining open problems. The second area  is to use quasiconformal maps and hyperbolic geometry in computational geometry, mostly in problems related to algorithms for meshing planar regions  with optimal complexity and geometry. Obtaining similar results in three dimensions  is one of the most important goals of the field, and the proposal describes some ideas for attacking this problem too. The final part of the proposal describes the dimension distortion properties of quasiconformal maps. This is one of the most interesting problems intrinsic to study of quasiconformal maps, but, as the proposal describes, can also be linked to famous open problems in computational geometry.<br/><br/>The proposed work will investigate how combinatorial and discrete ideas yield new results in analysis  and how ideas from conformal analysis and hyperbolic geometry can prove new theorems about discrete geometry and meshing.  Conformal maps preserve angles; these maps have been intensively studied for over 150 years and are of fundamental importance to a wide variety of problems in analysis, geometry, probability, physics and engineering.  Classically,  conformal maps  have been used in the study of  various differential equations related to fluid flow, heat conduction and wave propagation.  More recently,  conformal maps have been fundamental to the study of statistical mechanics, percolation  and random growth models.  Quasiconformal maps allow a controlled amount of angle distortion. These maps are a flexible and extremely useful generalization of conformal maps  that  help us better understand the special case of conformal mappings, but also introduces many important new problems and techniques.  The PI's previous work has used quasiconformal maps to give the best known algorithm for computing conformal maps onto polygons and the best known algorithms for meshing planar domains into  triangles or quadrilaterals with optimal geometric properties.  Such meshes play an important role in many numerical problems from computer graphs to finite element methods for PDEs and many of these methods work more effectively if the underlying mesh has good geometric properties.  The proposed work will extend and sharpen the results already obtained and will use similar ideas to attack other problems that arise in dynamics and geometry."

The first of these arises from a particularly promising definition of quasilocal mass due to Bartnik, which seeks to localize the total (or ADM) mass. Although this definition satisfies most desired properties, and thus has the potential to be very useful, its abstract and nonconstructive nature yield severe limitations on understanding and applicability. In order to rectify this problem the Static/Stationary Metric Extension Conjecture asserts that the quasilocal mass may be calculated as the ADM mass of a solution to the Static/Stationary Vacuum Einstein equations which satisfies a certain geometric boundary condition. In recent joint work of the PI and M. Anderson, existence for this boundary value problem has been established under a reasonable assumptions; this development is a significant step towards the full conjecture. The Penrose Inequality relates the total mass of a spacetime to the area of its event horizons (boundary of black holes) via the inequality: total mass squared is greater than or equal to the total area of the event horizons divided by 16 pi. This may be viewed as a conjecture for an arbitrary spacelike slice of a spacetime, and in this setting an important special case (when the second fundamental form of the slice vanishes) has been confirmed independently by Huisken and Ilmanen (one black hole) and by Bray (finitely many black holes). In recent joint work with Bray, the PI has succeeded in reducing this problem to solving a canonical system of partial differential equations, and has confirmed existence in special cases. With Q. Han the PI has completely analyzed the blow-up and regularity properties for half of this system. It is a major goal of this project to complete this program by proving a general existence result, and thus establishing the Penrose Conjecture. The PI also plans to extend this reduction process in order to yield a systematic way of treating other related geometric inequalities.<br/><br/><br/>Although there are numerous proposed definitions for quasilocal mass in General Relativity, most seem to suffer from one affliction or another. In the case of Bartnik's mass, the sole problem is the abstract nature of its definition. If the Static Extension Conjecture were verified, this lone difficulty should be resolved, thus opening the way for several applications. For example, it is generally believed that whenever enough mass is concentrated in too small of a region, gravitational collapse must ensue and result in a black hole - such a statement is often referred to as the Hoop Conjecture. While there are many ways to accurately describe the size of a region, until a proper notion of quasilocal mass is established, a rigorous and complete version of this conjecture will remain elusive. Another possible application of a properly defined notion of quasilocal mass, is to the long time existence problem for the Einstein Equations. As these equations form a hyperbolic system, it is tempting to search for a theory based on an energy method analogous to the classical theory of the scalar wave equation. A major obstacle to realizing such an approach, is the lack of an appropriate notion of energy for the gravitational field (a constituent of quasilocal mass). Moreover the boundary value problem associated with the Static/Stationary Extension Conjecture, is in fact an elliptic boundary value problem for the Ricci operator. Hence the techniques developed to study this conjecture should prove useful when investigating well-posed boundary value problems in several other settings, such as for instance, the Ricci flow on manifolds with boundary. As for the Penrose Inequality, it was originally put forth by Penrose to study what is perhaps the most important open question in General Relativity today, namely the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (whether spacetime singularities are always enclosed by black holes), which is related to General Relativity's veracity as a physical theory. Heuristically, the Penrose Inequality is essentially a necessary condition for cosmic censorship to hold. Thus if the Penrose Inequality were to be confirmed it would add significantly to the general belief in the validity of cosmic censorship. Lastly,  methods developed for the full Penrose Inequality are expected to provide a new powerful tool for reducing questions concerning general initial data sets to the case of time symmetry, and therefore will have numerous applications to a wide range of other problems in General Relativity."

The main goal of the conference is to bring together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory. String theory, as well as quantum field theory, has contributed a series of profound ideas which gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones. For mathematics, string theory has been a source of many significant inspirations, ranging from Seiberg-Witten theory in four-manifolds, to enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry, to work on the Jones polynomial in knot theory, to advances in symplectic topology, to recent progress in the geometric Langlands program and the development of derived algebraic geometry and n-category theory. In the other direction, mathematics has provided physicists with powerful tools, ranging from powerful differential geometric techniques for solving or analyzing key partial differential equations, to toric geometry, to K-theory and derived categories in D-branes, to the analysis of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string compactifications, to the use of modular forms and other arithmetic techniques. The depth, power and novelty of the results obtained in both fields thanks to their interaction is truly mind boggling. String-Math is the annual conference that was founded to reflect the most significant progress at the interface of string theory and mathematics.<br/><br/>String theory is the attempt to build a mathematical model which describes all four fundamental forces and all forms of matter. It assumes that the fundamental objects of the theory are one-dimensional objects - ""strings"" with elementary particles (i.e., electrons and quarks) being oscillations of fundamental strings. In particular, string theory aims to reconcile gravity, i.e., general relativity, with quantum mechanics which is the formalism in which the other three forces are described. String theory is very mathematical in nature and its development was based on advances in modern mathematics and inspired many recent developments in mathematics.  The main goal of the String-Math conference is to bring together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory.  By now there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and physicists working at the string-theoretic interface between the two academic fields. The influence flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and ideas contributing crucially to major advances in string theory. Following the success of first two meetings of String-Math series the conference String-Math 2013 is expected to have a major impact on the field and to serve as a record of the state of the art in string-related mathematics."

In Riemannian geometry, he will continue his work on classifying Riemannian submersions from space forms and other symmetric spaces, work on classifying special metrics (such as solitons and metrics with restrictions on the algebraic type of the curvature tensor), and on understanding the integrable systems associated with special holonomy metrics of higher cohomogeneity. In Finsler geometry, Bryant will continue to develop the theory of Finsler manifolds with constant flag curvature, both in constructing new examples and in understanding the properties of their geodesic flows; the relations with twistor theory and exotic holonomy structures will be especially examined.  In complex geometry, Bryant will continue his work on characterizing the rational normal structures induced on the moduli space of rational contact curves in holomorphic contact $3$-folds, with the goal of understanding how these are connected to integrable systems and their curvature properties.  All these (and other related projects) will produce results that are useful in themselves, but they will also motivate the development of new techniques in exterior differential systems and the method of equivalence and will facilitate the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in these techniques.<br/><br/>Many of the important advances in our ability to use mathematics in physics and other sciences have depended on developing a geometric understanding of those problems, i.e., an understanding that focuses only on the aspects of those problems that are not tied to specific (often, arbitrarily chosen) coordinate systems.  For example, Einstein's formulation of General Relativity came only after he was able to employ the coordinate-free concepts of Riemannian geometry effectively to isolate and describe the essential nature of gravity as the curvature of space-time.  However, coordinate-free formulations of a problem often reveal degeneracies that need to be approached by nonstandard tools, such as the theory of differential systems.  Bryant's plan of research, which applies the coordinate-free theories of differential systems and the method of equivalence, will lead to a more fundamental, geometric understanding of a number of problems that arise in the study of surfaces in space, the special structures that arise because of extra or hidden symmetries, and the nature of curvature itself in a number of geometric contexts."

Thus, a large portion of the proposed project concerns the further extension of gluing techniques for solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations of minimal surfaces and constant mean curvature surfaces, to study important existence and uniqueness questions for singularities and long time behavior of the two curvature flows. Such transplantation of techniques has already proven successful, also in the previous work of the P.I.<br/>Firstly, in the project the P.I. will, in collaboration with Prof. Nicos Kapouleas (at Brown University) and Dr. Stephen J. Kleene (at MIT), continue their joint work on gluing constructions for minimal surfaces and mean curvature flow singularities for surfaces in 3-manifolds, and applications to solitons in the curvature flows. Secondly, the PI will, in collaboration with Dr. Hskuldur P. Halldorsson, establish existence results for new types of long time solutions under mean curvature flow in Euclidean space. Thirdly, the P.I. will, alone or in collaboration with others, study time-dependent gluing constructions in mean curvature flow, and explore an analogous problem for 3-dimensional Ricci flow, which will further help guiding the on-going study of properties of this flow by many other researchers. Fourth, alone or in collaboration with others, initiate the study of gluing constructions for other nonlinear geometric PDEs. For example in relation to conformal geometry, complex geometry and constraints on Ricci curvature.<br/><br/><br/>Minimizing the area of an interface between two regions is a fundamental problem which arises in many scientific and engineering applications. Mean curvature flow, being defined as the fastest way to locally decrease the area of a given surface, is formulated as a partial differential equation, very similar in nature to that which governs the flow of heat in a material. While key foundational results are known, many of the basic questions remain unanswered. Already, many very striking applications, lauded by experts across the sciences, have in recent years followed from the study of these particular flows. Many more are expected to arise both within and outside of mathematics, such as in astronomy, to black holes and the large-scale structure of the universe, and in chemistry, to complex molecules. The proposal involves research problems at varying levels, and so there is rich opportunity and concrete plans to include as well undergraduate students as graduate students, postdoctoral and faculty researchers across institutions in the project. Given the manifest geometric and physically motivated nature of the material, the ideas and results of the project are also very suitable for an inspiring communication, visually and otherwise, to a broad audience."

Following the guiding philosophy of Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture, certain relationships between these invariants are expected, and the main aim of the project is to establish these relationships, while staying firmly rooted in explicit examples and computations.<br/><br/>Broadly, the project investigates symplectic manifolds, which are spaces that locally look like the phase spaces of classical mechanics. Given a symplectic manifold, one can cook up a variety of interesting structures (called 'invariants'), bearing a strong resemblance to ideas coming from string theory; in fact, in some sense these invariants describe what physics would look like for strings living on a space with a symplectic structure. Investigations by physicists have predicted surprising connections between the physics experienced by particles living on spaces with a symplectic structure, and that experienced by particles living on a completely different kind of space: a space with an algebraic structure. This deep connection between two completely different kinds of spaces is very surprising, and not at all well-understood. Even so, it is very useful for mathematicians who study invariants of symplectic manifolds, because it gives predictions for what they should be in terms of algebraic geometry, which one can then set about verifying mathematically. The project aims to follow this strategy to investigate certain kinds of symplectic invariants, which have a variety of useful applications in different areas of mathematics and physics."

Conformal geometry studies the structure of spaces in which there is a well defined notion of lengths, but the emphasis is on related measurements of length where the notion of angles is preserved. Similarly minimal surface theory studies the placement of surfaces in an ambient space in which there is a well defined notion of length and hence notion of area. Common to both disciplines is the use of differential equations to study related geometric invariants. In recent years there is extensive developments in analytic techniques in differential equations that have direct applications in both conformal geometry and minimal surfaces.

One of the PIs has shown that for each p greater than 1 there is an Lp Brunn-Minkowski theory. Thus far, most work on this new theory has been limited to p greater than 1, but the PIs together with Boroczky have made progress in the singular case of p = 0. Just as the classical Minkowski problem is a central focus of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory, its Lp analogue is central to the new theory. For p greater than 1, there has been significant progress on the elliptic PDE now known as the Lp Minkowski problem. A complete solution of the zero-th Minkowski problem would have a profound impact on a number of important questions. The PIs in collaboration with Boroczky have established both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to this logarithmic Minkowski problem when the prescribed ""data""' is even. They have also established uniqueness in two dimensions. Proving uniqueness in higher dimensions is part of the proposed work. One particular focus of the PIs' research is the development of affine isoperimetric inequalities. Over the years the PIs have established a number of sharp affine isoperimetric inequalities and their analytic counterparts. New methods recently developed by the PIs will be used to extend earlier work. While the Brunn-Minkowski theory has been an effective tool for solving a variety of basic inverse problems involving data about projections of convex bodies onto subspaces, the study of a dual Brunn-Minkowski theory initiated by one of the PIs is ideal for dual questions involving intersections of convex bodies with subspaces. The PIs have recently discovered new dual curvature measures that arise naturally within the dual theory and believe that newly developed tools within the dual theory can be used to solve the PDE that is the natural dual analogue of the Christoffel-Minkowski problem. An intensive effort to solve this PDE is a central part of the work proposed. Previous work of the PIs has indicated fascinating parallels between information theory and both the Lp Brunn-Minkowski theory and its dual. The PIs will continue to investigate connections between a subject that is associated with Electrical Engineering and one that is considered pure mathematics.<br/><br/>The Brunn-Minkowski theory and its dual are the core of convex geometric analysis and are the foundation of Geometric Tomography. Geometric Tomography aims at retrieving information about a geometric object from data about its lower dimensional sections or projections. It has had and clearly will continue to have practical applications in science, engineering, and even medicine (think CAT scan machines). While isoperimetric inequalities go back to the ancient Greeks, many of the newer ones are applicable in geometry, analysis, and even engineering. The new inequalities and theories that the PIs propose to establish (and extend) should result in the development of mathematical tools that offer potential new applications to mathematics, science, and engineering."

The first broad area of the proposal centers on the study of singularities in  MCF, including estimates for the size of the singular sets, a compactness theorem for the possible types of singularities, a classification of generic singularities of the flow, and a canonical neighborhoods theorem that describes the flow in a neighborhood of the generic singularities.  These are the most important questions about singularities and the PI and his collaborator have already obtained significant results in this direction.  The second main area of the proposal concerns the structure of Einstein manifolds and, in particular, the question of when an Einstein manifold has a unique asymptotic structure (or tangent cone at infinity).  The main prior result in this direction is due to Cheeger and Tian in 1994, where they showed uniqueness under an integrability assumption that the PI would like to remove.  These sort of uniqueness questions have played an important role in a number of areas of geometric analysis and are extremely important in understanding the structure of the singular set for limits of Einstein manifolds.<br/><br/>This project focuses on several geometric variational problems.  The problems are mathematical, but many of them arose first in science and engineering.  Perhaps the most natural geometrically are minimal surfaces that locally minimize their surface area and, thus, model soap films in perfect equilibrium (so the film does not change other time). These have been studied at least since  Lagrange's 1762 memoir, but recent years have seen breakthroughs on many long-standing problems in the theory of minimal surfaces, with important contributions from many mathematicians.    There is a time-varying analog of this where a surface (which is not in equilibrium) evolves to minimize its surface area as quickly as possible; this is called mean curvature flow or MCF.  Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation  which is formally similar to the equation that governs the flow of heat in physics.  Clearly, minimal surfaces remain static under the MCF.  MCF and other geometric flows were   developed for their intrinsic beauty as well as their potential applications to other fields to model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in annealing metals, and crystal growth.  While key foundational results have been obtained, several of the most basic questions remain unanswered.  In contrast, the Einstein equation is a nonlinear differential equation for the curvature of a space (or a space-time in general relativity).  Hilbert realized a century ago that this comes up variationally as the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Einstein-Hilbert functional."

Cohomology theories provide useful invariants for topological spaces, and their classification by the spectra provides a unified picture, indicating how numerous they are. Nevertheless, our understanding of cohomology theories, along with their equivariant, differential, and other mixed variants, remains limited. This is partly due to the fact that aside from a few examples, such as ordinary cohomology and K-theory, there are no good geometric descriptions of the cohomology classes of a given theory with immediate ties to naturally occurring objects in geometry. Even in the case of K-theory and its variants, our current understanding leaves many questions unanswered. Geometrically representing classes of a theory has proven to be useful in many regards, including the construction of non-homotopy invariant refinements, like differential theories, their equivariant versions, and pushforwards (cocycle level index theorems). In this proposal, the PI studies several ways of obtaining geometric models for K-theories (equivariant, differential, and their mixes) as well as refinements that take into account the Wilson line effects by using the Bismut Chern character. In one component of the research, the PI studies differential K-theory using representatives of the Atiyah class in the Toledo-Tong twisted resolution. In another, the PI aims to use his work with his collaborators, on the equivariant holonomy for abelian gerbes, to study topological invariants of non-abelian grebes. The main tool for this part is the equivariant topological chiral homology. This research has graduate student components.<br/><br/>Cohomology theories, their variants, and refinements are part of a branch of mathematics called topology. Cohomological invariants can measure a wide variety of phenomena, from wrappings of a piece of rope around a pole, to the possibilities for the shape of the universe. Cohomological techniques and descriptions have taken a central role in modeling high energy physics phenomena to the extent that several fundamental concepts were originally discovered by physicist and mathematicians independently. Comparison and cross-fertilization between the two fields has resulted in an accelerated enrichment of both, a trend that continues to pick up momentum increasingly. A modern categorical point of view now serves as a common language for mathematicians and physicists to explore cohomological ideas and their byproducts. Several components of the grant engage undergraduate and graduate students."

Mathematically, those invariants are typically described as virtual Euler characteristics of some moduli spaces. The wall-crossing phenomenon is related to the presence of real codimension one ""walls"" in the space of parameters, where the invariants jump. In the case of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the walls live in the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the ppropriate Calabi-Yau categories. Similar walls also occur in the theory of representations of quivers and cluster algebras. In mirror symmetry, walls correspond to jumps in the number of pseudo-holomorphic discs bounded by the torus fibers of an SYZ Lagrangian fibration. In supersymmetric gauge theories in physics, the number of BPS states jumps across ""walls of marginal stability"". The Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas invariants thus occur in the physics literature on topics such as moduli spaces of vector ultiplets of 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories and supersymmetric black holes. Since these various wall-crossing formulas look so similar, one can ask for a common formalism. The aim of the FRG is to study the underlying ""wall-crossing structures"" and demonstrate hat the above-mentioned similarities are not coincidental, but rather reflect a deep underlying theory.<br/><br/>It is a frequently encountered situation in mathematics and physics that numerical quantities which in principle depend on various parameters actually are constant for general parameter values (they are ""invariants""), but jump along certain ""walls"" in the parameter space. Wall-crossing formulas describe these ""jumps"" quantitatively. The subject of wall-crossing has recently become a very active one due to its relevance to a number of different areas of mathematics and physics. The aim of this project is to develop the concept of ""wall-crossing structure"" rigorously and apply it to problems both old and new in which wall-crossing formulas appear. The results arising from this project will be in demand by both the mathematics and physics communities. The FRG will also build a research community around this coordinated effort, involving a mix of junior and senior researchers, training opportunities for graduate students, and the rganization of several workshops."

Although it plays an important role in many branches of mathematics, such as enumerative geometry, Gromov-Witten theory, and random matrix theory, it is still a poorly understood phenomenon. The goal of the proposed project is to establish a general mathematical framework underlying topological recursion. This structure is expressed through the newly introduced concepts of a topological recursion (TR) operad and TR co-operad, and allows one to understand the types of enumerative and geometric problems where Eynard-Orantin theory appears, a precise mechanism to calculate the spectral curve of such a problem, and, conversely, a concrete geometric or enumerative problem associated to an arbitrary spectral curve. To be specific, the combinatorial structure of Eynard-Orantin recursion is easily seen to be modeled on a TR operad, while in many specific examples where Eynard-Orantin recursion appears, such as intersection numbers of moduli spaces of stable curves, Hurwitz theory, Kontsevich's matrix integral, etc., there is a naturally appearing TR co-operad. In general, the Laplace transform of a TR operad is conjectured to determine the spectral curve. On the other hand, a variation of the Feynman transform (which appears in modular operads), takes a TR operad to a TR co-operad in the category of topological spaces, which comes equipped with a natural measure. The volume of the TR co-operad is conjectured to determine the Eynard-Orantin correlation functions which underlie the original TRoperad.<br/><br/>Successful completion of the project would go a long way to understanding the role and nature of topological recursion in general, and would provide several useful applications in enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory. The area being investigated is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, and related spaces. Such constructions arise in high energy physics and are crucial in our understanding of mirror symmetry, and more generally string theory. However, potential applications are not limited to theoretical physics. Because of the ubiquity of surfaces in everyday life, there are a surprising number of concrete applications for such an abstract subject. For example, ribbon graphs, one of the fundamental tools used to explore topological recursion, can be utilized in facial recognition algorithms. In addition, they appear in Feynman graph expansions, which are used to model particle collisions."

The study of Hodge structures and their symmetry groups, MumfordTate groups, lies at the intersection of complex geometry, representation theory and arithmetic. The proposed work addresses the relationship between Hodge theory and representation theory, with a focus on those aspects that may be described using complex geometry. (The Hodge theory of algebraic varieties will not be addressed: the emphasis is on Hodge structures as objects of independent interest.)  In the classical case that the Hodge domain D is a Hermitian symmetric space that may be equivariantly embedded in Siegel's upper-half space, the relation between Hodge theory and the geometric and arithmetic properties of a variety is a deep and extensively researched subject. The area is considerably less developed in the non-classical case, and it is generally felt that the principle obstacle to generalizing the theory (arithmetic properties, automorphic forms, theory of Shimura varieties, et cetera) is our limited understanding of the system of differential equations governing variations of Hodge structure.  The principle motivation and objective of this project is to better understand this system, the complex geometry of the Hodge domain D, and the associated representation theory in the non-classical setting.<br/><br/>Hodge theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical subjects, including Algebraic Geometry, Complex Geometry, Number Theory and Representation Theory.

A number of major developments took place in the last 15 years; some of the highlights are Kontsevich's formality theorem, the study of Poisson-sigma models and the relationship to the integrability problem for Lie algebroids, the relation with the moduli space of flat connections and various moment map theories, singular reduction, (generalized) complex geometry, cluster algebras, etc.<br/><br/>The Gone Fishing workshops aim to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists and groups working on areas related to Poisson geometry from different points of view. They bring together leading experts and young researchers in these subjects to encourage more interaction and cross fertilization between different fields. This is becoming more and more urgent as these fields progress deeper. The workshops also provide an excellent opportunity for US based scientists to exchange ideas and promote possible collaborations. One important theme of each workshop is to address important questions and future directions of the subject. The next meetings of the Gone Fishing workshops are: Temple University, Philadelphia, (Sept. 28-29, 2013); and the University of California at Berkeley, (Sept./Oct 2014).<br/><br/>URL: poissongeometry.org"

He specializes in applying contemporary methods such as curvature flows and h-principle theory to solve classical problems which often have simple intuitive statements, while their solutions may require sophisticated techniques. The PI's research in this area spans a wide range of topics including isometric embeddings, isoperimetric problems, geometric knot theory, polyhedral approximations, and connections with real algebraic geometry. Some recurring themes throughout these investigations are various notions of convexity or optimization, and the interaction between geometric and topological concepts, or local versus global properties of submanifolds. More specifically, a typical problem is how restrictions on curvature, intrinsic metric, or various boundary conditions, influence the global shape of a curve or a hypersurface, or even allow an embedding of that object in a Euclidean space of low codimension.  A fundamental problem in this area is that of isometric rigidity of surfaces: can one continuously deform a smooth closed surface in Euclidean space without changing its intrinsic metric?  We also consider a number of related problems involving the self-linking number or vertices of closed curves, spherical images of closed surfaces, and various deformations of submanifolds which preserve the sign or magnitude of the curvature. Other projects include inequalities for mean chord lengths of submanifolds, regularity of real algebraic hypersurfaces, and unfoldings of convex polyhedra.<br/><br/>Curves and surfaces are to geometry what numbers are to algebra. They form the basic ingredients of our visual perception and inspire the development of far reaching mathematical tools. Yet despite centuries of pure study, and an abundance of potential applications, there are still many fundamental open problems in this area which are strikingly intuitive and elementary to state.  Studying these problems may stimulate useful developments in pure mathematics, or lead to wider applications in science and technology. For instance, the PI's work on rigidity problem for surfaces may have applications for stability of complicated domes in modern architecture, or various physical frameworks. The polyhedral approximation techniques which the PI is proposing could be useful in computer aided design, and the emerging field of discrete differential geometry. The related studies of the Gauss maps of surfaces could be useful in computer vision and optics, while studying isoperimetric problems has been a significant source of enrichment in calculus of variations and mathematical physics. Further, folding-unfolding problems have numerous applications ranging from deployment of satellite dishes in space to implantation of stents in human arteries. Another impact of the proposed activity would be development of connections between various fields, as in the PI's work on tangent cones, which combines concepts from geometric measure theory, algebraic geometry, and convex analysis. Finally, these problems are ideal for introducing the general public to the exciting world of modern day mathematics, and arousing the interest of beginning students in Geometry."

The first group of problems considered in the proposal concerns generalizations of the Conley conjecture. This conjecture asserts the existence of infinitely many periodic points of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a symplectically aspherical, closed manifold. The Conley conjecture has been established by Hingston (for tori) and the PI, and eventually generalized to all closed symplectic manifolds with zero Chern class and to negative monotone symplectic manifolds. The PI proposes a variety of further generalizations of these results as well as a program to investigate the cases where the conjecture is known not to hold. In particular, the PI will study the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with a hyperbolic fixed point, higher dimensional generalizations of Franks? theorem, and the Conley conjecture for manifolds with large minimal Chern number. The second part of the proposal concerns a similar circle of questions for periodic orbits of Reeb flows. Finally, the main subject of the last part of the proposal is a study of Hamiltonian systems with finitely many periodic orbits and certain homological resonance relations on the actions and indices of the orbits. The ultimate goal of these projects is to better understand the underlying reasons for the abundance of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems. The methods to be utilized by the PI are essentially Floer-theoretic in nature. An essential new ingredient comes from the PI?s recent work, joint with Gurel, on periodic orbits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with a hyperbolic fixed point.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of physical processes in which dissipative forces can be neglected. For example, planetary motion in celestial mechanics and some electro- or magneto-dynamical processes can be, and usually are, treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the classical subjects lying at the very core of modern theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems and symplectic geometry is the study of periodic orbits (i.e., cyclic motions). Periodic orbits are ubiquitous: a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems have periodic orbits and the number of distinct periodic orbits is infinite for a broad class of systems. The analysis of this phenomenon is among the main objectives of the proposed research.  One novel ingredient of the proposed research is a new form of interaction between local and global features of Hamiltonian systems. For instance, the PI proposes to show that Hamiltonian systems with a certain type of local behavior must necessarily have infinitely many periodic orbits. The proposed research has potential applications to physics and mathematical aspects of mechanics."

Within the last two years, many new insights have been established around the idea of mirror symmetry and ""quantization"" of topological invariants for a large class of geometric spaces. The central driving force of the recent development is the discovery, due mainly to physicists Eynard, Orantin, Marino, and others, of a recursive formula for quantum invariants in terms of integral transforms over Riemann surfaces. For example, this recursion formula computes both open and closed Gromov-Witten invariants for all genera of an arbitrary toric Calabi-Yau three-fold. Here what we call the classical invariants of the Calabi-Yau space determine a Riemann surface as its mirror dual. Then the Eynard-Orantin recursion formula computes the quantum invariants, i.e., the higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants, of the original Calabi-Yau space. The mathematical structure of this miraculous procedure is best understood by the simplest example of the theory discovered by the PI, in collaboration with Dumitrescu and others. This example is based on the quest of mirror symmetric dual of the Catalan numbers, which has led the authors to an unexpectedly rich theory. The application of the mirror symmetry, and then of the quantization process of Eynard-Orantin, to the Catalan numbers, we obtain: (1) the virtual Poincare polynomials of the moduli spaces of smooth pointed curves; and (2) the intersection numbers of the tautological classes of the moduli spaces of stable pointed curves. For this particular example, and later for many other examples, the PI and his collaborators Bouchard, Shadrin, Sulkowski, and others, have discovered that the partition function (a special choice of the generating function of quantum invariants) satisfies the ""quantum curve"" equation, which is a Schrodinger equation. The idea of quantum curves is due to physicists Aganagic, Dijkgraaf, Klemm, Marino, Vafa, and others. For all examples that admit the quantum curve, it has also been verified that the partition function is a Baker-Akhiezer function of an integrable system of the KdV/KP type. Very surprisingly, a torsion condition of a Steinberg symbol in the second K-group in algebraic K-theory holds for all these examples. Establishing a mathematical understanding of the relation between this higher algebraic K-theory condition and the quantizability of a Riemann surface (in particular a knot A-polynomial), and the existence of a Baker-Akhiezer function behind the scene, in the context of quantum topological invariants, is the goal of the proposed project.<br/><br/>Pure mathematical research is often inspired by radical ideas from theoretical physics. The mirror symmetry is an example of such ideas: there are two very different mathematical ways of describing the physical universe. Since the universe is unique, we must conclude that these two mathematical theories are equivalent. The ""mirror symmetry"" refers to the relation of these two theories. Further extending the idea of mirror symmetry more mathematically, one arrives at a naive, but also quite radical, question: what is the mirror symmetric partner of Catalan numbers? If we consider Catalan numbers as a ""classical"" object, then what are the ""quantum"" generalization of them? The PI and his collaborators have discovered an affirmative answer to these questions. To their surprise, the answer turns out to provide the simplest mathematical example of a powerful speculative theory due to theoretical physicists. The physics theory predicts a concrete and universal formula to calculate an infinite series of characteristic numbers (called invariants) of the possible universe. This is a rather involved theory, and mathematical proofs of the formulas are also complicated. Our simplest example illustrates what is happening in an elementary language, and helps understanding the general theory. Building on the concrete mathematical foundation the PI and his collaborators have established, the PI proposes to study newly proposed conjectures on classical and quantum knot invariants by physicists. The quantum generalization of Catalan numbers count certain topological graphs. It is interesting to note that these numbers also appear in biology as the free energy of complex molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. For example, the quantum generalized Catalan numbers count the ""secondary"" structures of an RNA. The primary structure is the linear sequence of nucleotides. The secondary structure refers to the complication of its position due to knotted, tangled, and bridged, structures. Being a result of quantization, the generating function of these quantized Catalan numbers satisfies a Schrodinger equation. This also provides a simple example of another set of radical physics predictions related to quantization of surfaces. These predictions include new conjectures in knot theory. The proposed research project is aimed at establishing mathematically rigorous results, verifying speculative predictions from theoretical physics. The work is expected to have impact on several areas of pure mathematics. It is also expected to have an application in the study of secondary structures of complex molecules in biology. Through the construction and analysis of simple examples of the mysterious and miraculous theories with quite involved nature, the PI has been able to attract undergraduate students participating in these research topics. The proposed project contains an REU component to engage undergraduate students in the exciting research frontier."

The focus will be on understanding global properties of interesting classes of minimal surfaces, e.g., compactness properties. This will be done by studying the geometric structure of elements of the class.  This approach is motivated by far-reaching work of Colding and Minicozzi who characterized the structure of embedded minimal disks.  Their work has been the basis for much recent progress in the field.  The PI will attack these questions primarily by using methods originating in the theory of integrable systems - especially the geometric theory of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Specifically, the PI will develop preliminary work which suggests that many spaces of minimal surfaces possess dynamics which are modeled on the KdV equation. The connection between minimal surfaces and the KdV equation is best understood using language and ideas coming from projective geometry. As such, one over-arching goal of the project is to formalize these observations in the language of projective geometry and to understand the interaction between the dynamics and the geometry of the minimal surfaces.  A near-term goal is to apply the techniques developed to spaces of free-boundary minimal surfaces. These are particularly amenable to the methods and so act as good model spaces. Motivated by work of Meeks, Perez and Ros on properly embedded minimal surfaces of genus-zero, a longer-term goal is to blend this perspective with more established methods in order to answer questions about embedded minimal surfaces of finite genus. Chief among these is the question, raised by Colding and Minicozzi, whether a embedded minimal surface of finite genus which is complete is necessarily properly embedded.<br/><br/>A minimal surface mathematically models the shape of a soap film spanning a fixed wire frame. This is because, roughly speaking, the ""energy"" of such a film is given by its surface area and so stable configurations are those with least area - i.e., minimal surfaces. As such, the theory of minimal surfaces directly connects to problems arising in physics, chemistry, biology and materials science.  More broadly, minimal surfaces are an important model for many geometric variational problems - that is problems where one seeks to find and study the properties of geometric objects which are optimal in some sense.  In addition to being a fundamental principle in the physical sciences, such variational problems arise in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics.  A specific goal of the project is to understand the relationship between minimal surfaces and the KdV equation - an equation important in fluid dynamics.  In contrast to minimal surfaces, which are static, the KdV equation models a dynamic physical phenomena, namely the motion of certain one-dimensional water waves. The KdV equation possesses many remarkable mathematical properties and is important in other areas of physics, notably in string theory.  The relationship between the KdV equation and the minimal surface equation is poorly understood and any insight the project may shed on this connection should have broad importance both in mathematics and in physics."

The PI expects that a good notion of quasi-local mass and angular momentum will be important in the study of the Penrose inequality and the mass-angular-momentum inequality.  Finally, the PI plans to study gravitational radiation. The research will be based on PI's previous work with Lydia Bieri and Shing-Tung Yau on the memory effect where the radiation of gravitational energy is related to measurement of displacements of test particles. The PI plans to investigate gravitational radiation using quasi-local mass and to study the role of other conserved quantities in gravitational radiation.<br/><br/>While the concept of total energy of isolated systems is important in general relativity, the measurement of mass, momentum or angular momentum contained in a finite region is essential in many fundamental problems in general relativity. This is particularly important due to the non-local nature of gravitation. The proposed research evaluates the energy, momentum or angular momentum contained in any region of the universe. This allows the study of general relativity in regions where the gravitational field is strong. As a result, the proposed research will lead to a better understanding of formation of black holes and the gravitational radiation during the process."

This project considers the way in which these fields interact, particularly the effect on the geometry of locally symmetric spaces. More specifically, the PI will apply insights from number theory, group theory, algebraic geometry, and low dimensional topology to study the geometric and topological properties of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces. Special focus will be placed on lattices acting on real and complex hyperbolic space, where a better understanding of arithmetic lattices can shed light on several open questions about the geometry and topology of finite volume real and complex hyperbolic manifolds. Many well-known properties of 2 and 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds lead to analogous questions in higher dimensions, and it is of significant interest to study which of these properties are peculiar to low dimensions and which remain true for the more enigmatic higher-dimensional spaces.<br/><br/>Geometry and number theory are two of the most classical areas of mathematical study, and the interaction between the two has fascinated mathematicians since ancient times. This relationship lies behind countless great mathematical advances from Euclid's Elements to Gauss to Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Studying this interplay continues to bear deep fruit. Number fields are objects related to solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients (e.g., the rational numbers), and number fields give rise to an infinite family of geometric objects called arithmetic locally symmetric spaces, which lie at the heart of the Langlands program and often parameterize fundamental objects in mathematics and physics. Invariants of these number fields, like the discriminant of a polynomial, and properties of associated symmetry groups lead to deep insight about nature of these geometric spaces. Group theory is one of the most significant assets in the modern study of geometry and number theory, which goes back to Lagrange and Galois's study of the roots of polynomials and their symmetry, and the modern viewpoint originates in Klein's Erlangen program from the 1870s.

Symplectic geometry and periods of algebraic manifolds: We shall study extensively the new cohomological invariants for symplectic geometry introduced by Tseng and myself, which may be considered as generalization of Bott-Chern cohomology. We shall also study the mirror counterpart of this cohomology and interpret the role of the supersymmetric equations in II A and II B theories in this new cohomology. Many examples will be calculated to support our theory. For deeper understanding of the theory of mirror symmetry, we shall also calculate periods of algebraic manifolds which are not toric. Power method of D-modules will be used. 2. Gromov-Witten invariants and Calabi-Yau manifolds with elliptic vibrations: We shall extend my previous work with Yamaguchi to study the ring of higher loop amplitude in string theory. We shall give more refined structure to this ring and try to construct analogous properties of it that are close to classical automorphic form theory. We also like to understand in a deeper manner the singular structure of the degeneration of elliptic fiber structure of Calabi-Yau manifolds. They have interesting physical meaning. 3. SYZ construction of mirror manifolds: We like to study the affine structure that appears in this construction. Interesting equations will be solved. 4. Construction of balanced metric through understanding of twistor construction: Nonkahler geometry is playing an increasingly important role in string theory. We shall explore such balanced metrics. 5. Quasilocal mass in general relativity: Mu-Tao Wang, Po-Ning Chen, and I will continue to study the important quasilocal mass that Wang and I introduced. We hope to seek the important property of this mass and hopefully use it to study dynamics of Einstein equation. 6. Invariants of graph theory: We are developing intrinsic cohomology theory to directed graphs. We believe that we can construct rich invariant based on our construction.<br/><br/>Overall, we are applying geometric methods to solve important questions in new fronts of geometry that are closely related to physics, such as string theory and general relativity. The works on graph theory pioneer a new direction to understand complex networks which have fundamental importance in computer science and other areas of mathematics."

Galloway<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes to continue his work on two basic research directions: (i) the geometry and topology of initial data sets in general relativity, and (ii) spacetime rigidity results.<br/><br/>An initial data set in a spacetime M consists of a smooth spacelike hypersurface V, its induced metric h and second fundamental form K.  A 'marginally outer trapped surface' (MOTS) in V is a closed two-sided hypersurface whose out-going light rays have vanishing divergence. The presence of a MOTS signals a gravitationally extreme situation: Generically one expects the development of singularities and the formation of a black hole.  MOTSs arose in a more purely mathematical context in the work of Schoen and Yau concerning the existence of solutions to Jang's equation, in connection with their proof of positivity of mass. In a time-symmetric (K =0) initial data set a MOTS is simply a (2-sided) minimal surface.  An important theme in minimal surface theory for many years has been the use of minimal surfaces to study the topology of Riemannian manifolds.  In a similar vein, motivated by results on topological censorship (which are global in time results), the PI and collaborators, M. Eichmair and D.  Pollack, have recently studied the relationship between the topology of 3-dimensional asymptotically flat initial data sets and the occurrence of MOTSs.  In particular, using a consequence of geometrization and recent existence results for MOTSs, they have shown that non-trivial topology implies the existence of (immersed) MOTSs.  This can be interpreted as a non-time symmetric version of results of Meeks- Simons-Yau. This work raises many interesting questions that the PI proposes to work on, particularly in the context of higher dimensional initial data manifolds with inner horizon (MOTS boundary) which satisfy the 'dominant energy condition', a physically natural curvature condition.  The approach advocated makes use of the connection between solutions of Jang's equation and MOTSs.  Various rigidity problems will also be addressed, in connection with the aforementioned work, the PI's previous work with R. Schoen on the topology of black holes and the PI's recent work with Carlos Vega concerning a spacetime rigidity problem originally posed by Yau, a concrete version of which is known as the Bartnik splitting conjecture.<br/><br/>Modern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods. In more general terms, this project is concerned with the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific interest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These theories provide a method for studying the relationship among three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and light cones)."

Another goal is to extend the existing framework to a refined Fukaya category, leading to a tool for mirror symmetry proofs. Moreover, the proposal seeks to solidify and provide accessible expositions of the differential-topological foundations for regularizations of moduli spaces of elliptic PDEs.<br/><br/>The research projects described in this proposal concern symplectic geometry, the geometric structure that lies behind the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics. Recent applications of ideas from symplectic geometry include invariants that help to distinguish one (three or) four-dimensional space from another.

The focus is on understanding the effect of singularities on the geometry and topology of complex algebraic varieties. The first project deals with a detailed study of global analytical invariants (e.g., characteristic numbers and classes) of local complete intersections which measure the complexity of singularities. The PI also proposes a characteristic class version of Steenbrink's notion of Hodge spectrum for hypersurface singularities. The second project studies topological and analytical properties of Hilbert schemes of points on a quasi-projective algebraic manifold. These are moduli spaces describing collections of (not necessarily distinct) points on a given space, which bring out seemingly hidden aspects of the geometry and topology of the space under consideration. These moduli spaces, originally studied in algebraic geometry, are closely related to several branches of mathematics, such as singularities, symplectic geometry, representation theory and even theoretical physics. The PI aims to obtain a generating series formula for characteristic classes of these (very singular) moduli spaces. The third project deals with a study of characteristic classes of toric varieties, with applications to generalized Pick-type formulae and Euler-MacLaurin summation formulae. Toric varieties are of interest both in their own right as complex algebraic varieties, and for their applications to the theory of convex polytopes. For instance, the problem of counting lattice points in a convex polytope amounts to the computation of Todd classes of a certain toric variety. Characteristic class formulae for toric varieties often translate into surprising number-theoretic identities (e.g., expressed in terms of generalized Dedekind sums), which the PI aims to investigate in detail.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies patterns of geometric figures involving position and relative position without regard to size. From the very beginning, topology has developed under the influence of questions arising from the attempt to understand properties of ""singular"" (or irregular) spaces. Such spaces occur naturally in various fields of pure mathematics including geometric topology, algebraic geometry, number theory, and also in more applied fields, such as the study of configuration spaces for robot motion planning. Algebraic varieties, i.e., the spaces of solutions of polynomial equations, are major examples of singular spaces. They are the main objects of study in algebraic geometry, and also provide a convenient testing ground for topological theories. The proposed research aims to improve our understanding of topological properties of algebraic varieties, a task which often involves the discovery and study of subtle interactions between the local and global behavior of various invariants."

Mathematically, those invariants are typically described as virtual Euler characteristics of some moduli spaces. The wall-crossing phenomenon is related to the presence of real codimension one ""walls"" in the space of parameters, where the invariants jump. In the case of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the walls live in the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the ppropriate Calabi-Yau categories. Similar walls also occur in the theory of representations of quivers and cluster algebras. In mirror symmetry, walls correspond to jumps in the number of pseudo-holomorphic discs bounded by the torus fibers of an SYZ Lagrangian fibration. In supersymmetric gauge theories in physics, the number of BPS states jumps across ""walls of marginal stability"". The Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas invariants thus occur in the physics literature on topics such as moduli spaces of vector ultiplets of 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories and supersymmetric black holes. Since these various wall-crossing formulas look so similar, one can ask for a common formalism. The aim of the FRG is to study the underlying ""wall-crossing structures"" and demonstrate hat the above-mentioned similarities are not coincidental, but rather reflect a deep underlying theory.<br/><br/>It is a frequently encountered situation in mathematics and physics that numerical quantities which in principle depend on various parameters actually are constant for general parameter values (they are ""invariants""), but jump along certain ""walls"" in the parameter space. Wall-crossing formulas describe these ""jumps"" quantitatively. The subject of wall-crossing has recently become a very active one due to its relevance to a number of different areas of mathematics and physics. The aim of this project is to develop the concept of ""wall-crossing structure"" rigorously and apply it to problems both old and new in which wall-crossing formulas appear. The results arising from this project will be in demand by both the mathematics and physics communities. The FRG will also build a research community around this coordinated effort, involving a mix of junior and senior researchers, training opportunities for graduate students, and the rganization of several workshops."
