One of the main parts in this progress has been played by the String Theory, with its main idea of interpreting elementary particles as small circles (called strings) rather than point-like objects. On the mathematical side it has led to appearance not only of new problems in classical areas, but also a fast development of completely new areas. Even the terminology reflects that: Mathematicians speak about ""quantum groups"", ""mirror symmetry"", ""instantons"", ""branes"" - all those terms are borrowed from physics. In the opposite direction, many mathematical concepts (some of them were considered  esoteric at the time) now become powerful tools for a working physicist. String theorists speak about ""derived categories of branes"", ""motivic invariants"" - the terminology borrowed from mathematics. There is no doubt that the above-mentioned interaction will affect not only some  fields in mathematics and physics but will influence the way of thinking about the real world. Current project fits nicely in the above paradigm. It is highly motivated by the recent important developments in the 2-dimensional supersymmetric massive theories, but its scope is purely mathematical, and its applications are important for quantum physics.  The project connects new and active area of research in theoretical physics with deep mathematical questions in homological algebra, toric geometry, Floer theory and Topological Field Theory.  <br/><br/>In more technical terms, the project is devoted to the new approach to the concept of Fukaya-Seidel category, which is  the mathematical counterpart of the so-called Landau-Ginzburg model in physics. Main motivation for the ideas developed in the project was the work of physicists D. Gaiotto, G. Moore, E. Witten on 2-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. By replacing the language of plane webs proposed by physicists by the dual language of polygons, the PI  connects their formalism with the geometry of secondary polytopes of the polygon of critical values of the Landau-Ginzburg potential. The categorical structure which appears in the work of physicists is then  explained in the language of factorization sheaves on the secondary polytope. It opens the door to generalizations to the case of higher-dimensional Topological Field Theories. A conjectural new description of the Fukaya-Seidel category will be investigated by the PI. It generalizes the earlier ideas of Haydys as well as the more recent proposal of Gaitto, Moore and Witten. It expresses the Fukaya-Seidel category as a deformation of the category which has combinatorial nature. The deformation is given by some Maurer-Cartan element, which is  defined in terms of solutions to the  Witten (or zeta-instanton) equation. A conjectural relation of the degenerations of the moduli space of solutions to Witten equation with faces of the secondary polytope will also be studied. The relation of webs with Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the solutions is stressed. Several applications of the proposed formalism will be studied, such as:<br/>a) wall-crossing formulas of Cecotti-Vafa and Kontsevich-Soibelman;<br/>b) complexified and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory;<br/>c) Morse theory of functions which are Morse but not Morse-Smale. According to earlier work of Kapranov and Saito that story is intrinsically connected to Steinberg relations in the algebraic K-theory and Stasheff polytopes;<br/>d) relation to the theory of spectral networks of Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke."

The mathematical focus of the conference is on the fields of topology and geometry.  The greatest impact of the conference comes from its emphasis on the Southeast region of the US, especially on the junior researchers in this area.  Besides bringing a high profile conference to the area and allowing local researchers to interact with leading mathematicians from across the country, the Tech Topology Conference provides a platform for the promotion and advancement of the mathematics being done in the Southeast region.  Indeed, half of the speakers in the first four conferences have been from the Southeast, and one third have been junior researchers.  With the 2015 conference, the organizers will introduce a 5-minute lightning talk session, allowing the conference to feature even more of the work being done - especially by junior researchers - in the Southeast.<br/><br/>The Tech Topology Conference is a annual conference series at Georgia Institute of Technology that started in 2011. The main aims of the conference are: (1) to provide a high-profile Geometry-Topology conference to the Southeast that brings leaders in the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality mathematics being done in the Southeast and (2) to provide a convenient meeting place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research, and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country.  The Tech Topology Conference focuses on several areas of Geometry and Topology, all in line with the interests of the Geometry and Topology faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  In the past there have been lectures on 3-manifolds, dynamics, knots, and geometric group theory, to name a few.  In inviting speakers, the emphasis is on researchers in the Southeast, especially junior researchers.  For speakers and participants alike, the Tech Topology Conference provides a critical venue for researchers in the Southeast to interact with leaders in the field from around the country and to share their work.  Mathematical progress is integral to the whole idea of the Tech Topology Conference: the organizers provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and informally, to discuss mathematics.  Beginning in 2015 we there will be a lunchtime session consisting of 5-minute talks, enabling the conference to feature even more of the work being done in the Southeast.   The organizers post notes from the conference talks on the conference web site, making much of the mathematical content of the conference available publicly.<br/><br/>The conference website is ttc.gatech.edu"

Four-dimensional manifolds (with three spatial and one temporal direction) are used in  General Relativity as models for the Universe. Manifolds of other dimensions, such as two or  six, are used by theoretical physicists in String Theory models which may lead to a unification of Quantum Field Theory and Gravity. Because the solution sets of many equations arising in  theoretical physics and applied mathematics are manifolds, the ability to distinguish between  manifolds is useful throughout the mathematical sciences, as well as in Topology, Geometry, and  Theoretical Physics. The work  undertaken in this project will lead to a rare mathematical proof of a prediction from supersymmetric quantum  field theory. The discovery in 2012 at CERN of the Higgs boson confirms the Standard Model, but supersymmetry has not yet been detected by the Large Hadron Collider experiments.  However, the Principal Investigators' research shows that at least some consequences of supersymmetry can be  mathematically verified.  The  activities in this project should also lead to greater involvement of minorities, especially African-American  and Hispanic students, and women in mathematics research, given the Principal Investigators' record and continuing  desire to encourage women and minorities to pursue careers in mathematics and to provide  mentorship and training.  To communicate this work to a wider audience, the Principal Investigators will write a research monograph based on this project, and organize conferences at Rutgers University and Florida International  University and special sessions at national American Mathematical Society meetings each year  from 2015 through 2018. <br/> <br/>In 1994, using supersymmetric quantum field theory, Edward Witten derived his celebrated formula relating Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants of a closed, oriented, smooth four-dimensional manifold with admissible topology and simple type. The first goal of this project is  to complete the proof of Witten's formula, employing a mathematically rigorous method based  on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles; the Principal Investigators have completed all steps of this program except their work on the gluing theorem for non-Abelian monopoles. They will also use non-Abelian monopoles to define new invariants of four-dimensional manifolds, investigate higher- rank Donaldson invariants, and derive relations between the instanton and Seiberg-Witten Floer homologies of closed three-dimensional manifolds."

The focus will be on the intersection between representation theory, algebraic topology, and commutative algebra. There is a long tradition of interaction between commutative algebra and algebraic topology, and commutative algebra and representation theory. Techniques and concepts that arose and were developed in one field have driven developments in the other. Regrettably, opportunities for building and fostering collaborations, especially among graduate students and  younger researchers, from the three subjects (or indeed any two of them) have been all too rare, especially in the U.S. The three subjects have witnessed remarkable changes and developments in the last decade, and the CRM program comes at an opportune moment. This NSF award will fund the travel of younger researchers (graduate students, recent PhDs, and junior faculty) at U.S. institutions to participate in some of the key events of the program. This will provide them with a unique opportunity to learn about current research in these fields and the interactions between fields; discuss ideas with one another, and begin collaborations on future research.<br/><br/>The topics to be covered by the CRM program, and in particular the advanced courses and workshops: matrix factorizations, maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules; cluster algebras and cluster categories; cohomological theory of support varieties; and tilting theory, to name a few, are at the intersection of several important and rapidly developing areas of mathematics, each subject benefitting from advances in the others. The CRM program will bring together leading researchers in each of these subjects, and one can be optimistic that this will lead to the new insights and developments in them. The highlights of the program include two, week-long, advanced courses, one in February 2015, titled (Re)emerging methods in Commutative Algebra and Representation Theory, and another in April 2015, titled Building bridges between Algebra and Topology. Each will be followed by a week-long workshop. Additionally, a conference is scheduled for  25--29th May, 2015."

The ""Gone Fishing"" workshop series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson Geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers alike.  The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists, and groups working on related areas having different perspectives.  As these various fields continue to progress further, it is becoming increasingly urgent to encourage more interaction and cross fertilization between them. Last but not least the ""Gone Fishing"" meetings  provide a unique forum forjunior mathematicians from all over the United States to  learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson Geometry and to disseminate  their own research results in the field. <br/><br/>Poisson Geometry originates as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics.  Its history begins with 19th century classics by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the works of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein.  Today, Poisson Geometry intersects and is applied to many areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The ""Gone Fishing"" workshops provide an excellent opportunity for scientists based in North America to exchange ideas and stimulate collaboration. Each workshop has a goal to address important questions and future directions of the subject. <br/><br/>URL: http://math.colorado.edu/gonefishing2016/"

A thorough understanding of these equations requires incorporating techniques from physics, analysis, and geometry, and results in a deeper understanding of all of those areas.  Aiming at the long term fulfillment of these research goals, we will enact a number of educational activities. These include outreach activities to recruit local high school and community college students into the UC system, opportunities for undergraduates to gain research experience in this area of mathematics, and programs aimed at graduate-level education and training in both research and teaching activities.

We will use a variety of techniques from PDE and geometry to understand these flows, in conjunction with the goal of training students at all levels. These equations appear quite naturally in physical contexts, so progress on the questions outlined in this proposal would yield insights and have impact beyond geometry, specifically to understanding PDE, complex geometry, and mathematical physics.

The first project will build on the PI's work with Dinew and Zhang which proved the interior Holder continuity of the second order derivative for the weak solution of complex Monge-Ampere equations. This estimate is essential in studying the Kahler metric whose potential is of weak regularity. The PI proposes to establish this regularity estimate under more optimal condition. Along this direction, the PI will also study some interior estimates for the complex Monge-Ampere type equations. In the second project, the PI is determined to extend his recent work with Wang about the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) estimate on general Riemannian manifolds. The PI will investigate more interesting applications of this ABP method that is not broadly exploited in geometric analysis yet. It is possible to apply this technique to study the first proposed project on the complex Monge-Ampere equations. The third project concerns the mean curvature flows for Lagrangian submanifolds with boundaries which is related to a boundary value problem of a fully nonlinear equation. If the analytic parts were well understood, it would provide a powerful tool to construct special Lagrangian submanifolds with boundaries and to study the existence of the area-preserving minimal maps between bounded domains.<br/><br/>This project aims at studying problems arising from differential geometry via fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. The goal is to better understand relations between geometric quantities and properties of these important geometric fully nonlinear equations. The innovative techniques developed in this proposal will lead to the solutions of important problems in geometry and enriching the existing theory of fully nonlinear partial differential equations in general. In the process, this work is having important consequences in both physics and applied sciences."

This award provides travel support for US PhD students, postdocs and scientists to participate in the conference, which is sponsored by the Tsinghua Sanya International Mathematics Forum. In particular, this award enables students and early career researchers, who do not have other financial resources, to join the conference and to interact with international leading experts in the field. Mathematical general relativity (GR) studies the laws of the universe encoded in the Einstein equations linking the curvature of spacetime to its matter content by means of mainly geometric analysis. It thereby generates further important research results in geometric analysis as well as it answers burning physical questions about the universe. The nature of these problems require a deep understanding of the underlying geometry and the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations. <br/><br/>This conference will bring together leading international researchers working in different areas of mathematical general relativity to discuss their results, to initiate new collaborations and to investigate new directions of research in this field. In recent years, monumental breakthroughs in mathematical GR and geometric analysis have occurred. Among them we find the results showing that through the focusing of gravitational waves a closed trapped surface and subsequently a black hole will form. Moreover, initial data engineering has made huge progress through gluing techniques. Geometric flows and energy methods have proven to be essential in solving important problems in all areas of mathematical GR. New insights on the nature of gravitational waves, which are believed to be detected in the near future, have been obtained by geometric-analytic as well as numerical methods. Similar geometric-analytic techniques were used to gain new insights in other mathematical fields. A major goal of this conference is to facilitate interactions between different groups working in GR, including geometric analysts, physicists, astrophysicists and numerical relativists. The topics that will be discussed at this event range from gravitational waves to stability and formation of black holes, to strong cosmic censorship, to concepts of energy and quasilocal mass and related phenomena. In all these areas geometric analysis has played key roles in advancing exciting research in both mathematical and physical directions. A crucial point of the conference is to forge professional links between experts and graduate students as well as early career researchers, in particular to expose students and early career researchers to new developments in these areas. <br/><br/>Conference website: http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/sanya/2016/CGR2016/home.aspx"

Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) is one such mathematician. In this conference, young mathematicians and students will get both deep insights and gain inspiration from Riemann's work.

Indeed, Riemann's contributions have set the foundations of entire areas of mathematics which are actively studied. Among these, Riemann's study of the geometry of space has evolved into one of the most important problems in geometry and theoretical physics: what is the geometry of space-time that can simultaneously explain the very small scale physics (quantum physics) and very large scale physics (cosmology as explained by general relativity)?  The organizers expect this problem to be a major driving force of geometry and theoretical physics in this century. This conference will feature a number of distinguished speakers, including Professor Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study. The activity will put Riemann's work into proper perspective, while attracting a younger generation of mathematicians to these subjects, and providing a forum to discuss future directions of development of mathematics and their interaction with physics."

The project has a component related to discrete forms of geometric data and the Laplace operator on metric measure spaces. Two graduate students of the principal investigator will be working on experimental measurements of frequencies of vibrating bodies of unusual shapes.<br/><br/>It is known that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold are approximated by eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a (suitably weighted) graph Laplace operator of a proximity graph on an epsilon-net.  One of these projects seeks to extend that result to the Laplacian on differential forms and to get better estimates for the Laplacian on metric measure spaces, including stability results.  It would be very interesting to  understand which spaces with bounded geometry can be approximated to an additive error by graphs with uniform bounds on degrees of vertices and lengths of edges. So far, we can do that only for the 2-plane and not even for 3-space, but we do not know a single counterexample to the main conjecture in this area.  One project aims to prove Michel's Conjecture on boundary rigidity under reasonable hypotheses.  Another project will study dynamical systems with positive entropy in which entropy is generated locally, that is, positive entropy is generated in arbitrarily small tubes around one trajectory.

The organizers anticipate inviting many mathematicians at the postdoctoral and graduate student level (from Asia, Europe, and the United States) to these summer schools. Both summer schools will include a poster session so as to give young researchers a chance to present their recent work.

GAP XIII (2015) will be devoted to derived geometry and GAP XIV (2016) to quantization. Higher structures has emerged as a new field in mathematics, as well as in mathematical and theoretical physics. The subject has undergone tremendous exploration recently due to its close connection to a number of areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, including algebraic topology, Lie theory, homotopy algebras, mirror symmetry, string theory, quantum field theory and noncommutative geometry. The project will be devoted to bringing together different aspects of higher structures, in particular derived geometry and quantization, as well as identifying new emerging directions of investigation, which is becoming more and more urgent as the field progresses. Derived geometry develops a powerful machinery for studying the residual geometry of badly behaved intersections and quotient spaces of high current interest in different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics while quantization establishes bridges between classical and quantum physics. Roughly speaking, quantization is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, based on the geometry of the underlying classical objects."

For example, the planetary motion in celestial mechanics, the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid, and the motion of a charged particle in an electro-magnetic field are usually treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the most important questions concerning the dynamics of such systems and connected to many other branches of mathematics and physics is the existence of periodic orbits. Corresponding to cyclic motion, this is the simplest dynamical phenomenon after equilibrium, and an investigation of periodic orbits of a system is crucial in understanding its global behavior. To give but a few applications, the knowledge of periodic orbits is crucial in astronomy, particle accelerators, and fluid dynamics or can be used to understand stability of solutions for large times. Hamiltonian systems tend to have numerous periodic orbits, but proving the existence of even one closed orbit often requires advanced and powerful mathematical tools. This research project aims at establishing the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for a broad class of Hamiltonian systems and analyzing the systems that fall outside this class, and the work will advance our understanding of the dynamics of conservative systems and result in the development of new powerful techniques applicable to other questions. Many of the systems considered in the proposal (e.g., magnetic flows) are of interest in physics and engineering, and some of the projects are expected to have applications in mathematical physics, geometric mechanics, and other areas.<br/><br/>The research program focuses on the question of the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for Hamiltonian dynamical systems in a variety of settings and on new methods to investigate this question that are currently being developed by the PI. The research comprises several interconnected projects addressing various aspects of this question for certain classes of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and Reeb flows and also for specific Hamiltonian systems such as magnetic flows. The project also opens up new research directions such as the study of non-contractible periodic orbits on closed manifolds. The PI will tackle these problems employing symplectic topological methods including Floer and quantum homological techniques, contact and symplectic homology, J-holomorphic curves, and spectral invariants, and will continue to develop new Floer theoretic techniques tailored for the study of periodic orbits. The projects have applications to other questions of interest in symplectic and contact dynamics and topology, classical dynamical systems, and Riemannian geometry."

Some of the well-studied objects in algebraic geometry are the projective plane (the plane with additional ""points at infinity"") and curves on it. A natural question is that of finding the number of curves that satisfy certain special conditions, such as passing through fixed points or having special shapes, which was the starting point of a branch of algebraic geometry called enumerative geometry. During the past twenty years, the interaction between enumerative geometry and string theory in physics has resulted in many exciting new developments and has been a central area of current research.  This research project aims to define and study new invariants, in a broader sense on general algebraic surfaces, that have connections to both mathematics and physics. These invariants contain sophisticated information about the number of singular curves, the geometric properties of the surface, and the parametrization space of singular curves. The project envisages development of a theoretical framework and tools for computation, as well as establishing connections between different subjects in mathematics.  It will add to the understanding of geometry of algebraic varieties and has application to the description of spacetime in string theory.<br/><br/>This research project treats several problems in algebraic geometry, especially about the enumeration of singular curves on algebraic surfaces and its motivic generalization. Previous work has established that the numbers of varieties with certain given singularities satisfy universal formulas. This project concerns the generalization of these universal formulas in the motivic sense. The research defines a sequence of motivic invariants and studies their quantitative properties as well as their geometric interpretation. The work aims to extend the existing connections with Gromov-Witten theory, stable pairs theory, and modular forms for these new invariants, and to compare them with other motivic curve-counting invariants. One of the advantages of these new invariants is that they satisfy nice formulas and only depend on topological intersection numbers."

They have been studied in diverse mathematical and physical disciplines for a long time. This project is concerned with counting Lagrangian surfaces that end on a given knot: the investigator's previous work has lead to a new prediction relating their enumeration to ""cluster algebras."" Explaining the prediction requires tools from string theory, quantum field theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. <br/><br/>This project develops an approach to understanding Lagrangian surfaces that end on a fixed Legendrian knot, by giving an explicit model for their moduli. The PI will show that this model has a rich geometric and combinatorial structure: it is an affine complex symplectic manifold and a cluster variety, with the clusters indexed by exact Lagrangian fillings of the knot. When the knot is algebraic, the PI will show that these fillings are related via nonabelian Hodge theory to the theory of irregular connections on Riemann surfaces. This perspective will lead to new results in Legendrian knot theory, for instance a complete enumeration of exact Lagrangian fillings of braid-positive Legendrian knots, and to new connections with algebraic geometry."

On the other hand, these canonical geometries have relations to a wide variety of established fields in mathematics. Moreover, Monge-Ampere type equations arise in a wide variety of problems in pure and applied mathematics and have a wide range of real-world applications, such as meteorology and optimal design of networks. Developing methods and techniques to construct and approximate solutions to such equations and to study their regularity could have applications in other instances where these equations appear. Finally, the Legendre transform is a classical tool in mathematics, mechanics, and economics, and seeking generalizations of this theory to other settings, as in this project, could find a broad range of applications.<br/><br/>A number of the equations proposed in this project are new, fall outside of the traditionally known Monge-Ampere type equations, and have exciting new geometric applications requiring new analytical tools. A novel feature in this research is to apply several different tools of microlocal analysis, traditionally pertaining to linear problems, to study these fully nonlinear equations. Another theme is to investigate novel relations between convex analysis and geometry and complex analysis and geometry. The problems investigated include: (1) Kahler-Einstein metrics with conic singularities. These metrics provide a new powerful analytic tool in algebraic and complex geometry. (2) The PI will study a new degenerate version of the special Lagrangian equation. It governs geodesics in the space of positive Lagrangians on a Calabi-Yau manifold. Understanding solutions of this equation requires new methods and will have applications to existence and uniqueness of special Lagrangians, singularities of Lagrangian mean curvature flow, the topology of the space of Lagrangians, and Lagrangian intersection theory. (3) The PI shall study the space of Kahler metrics using geodesics in the space, finite-dimensional Bergman approximations, Fourier integral operators with complex phase, and the metric space geometry of this space. (4) The PI is developing interactions between complex and convex geometry, including a differential theory for the polarity transform in parallel to the known theory for the Legendre transform. New equations of Hamilton-Jacobi and Monge-Ampere type that arise from this will be investigated as well as complex analogues.

The aim of this project is to advance our understanding of these ends in two complementary ways: by constructing new examples with unexpected properties, and by proving classification theorems to narrow down the range of possible phenomena. On the examples side, this will include the construction of Einstein metrics with isolated singularities not homeomorphic to their tangent cones, Einstein metrics with complex hyperbolic cusp ends, Einstein metrics interpolating between different Ricci-flat cones, and Einstein manifolds of unbounded topology. On the classification side, the main goal is to resolve open questions in the theory of gravitational instantons (complete hyper-Kahler manifolds of real dimension 4), by further developing a compactification technique recently introduced by the PI and his coauthors."

The second project concerns the center of mass and angular momentum and the question of isoperimetry in asymptotically flat initial data sets. The PI has been investigating several different notions of center of mass and angular momentum, assuming parity conditions.

Manifolds of curvature greater than or equal to zero have been an active area of study for many years, with most known examples produced by imposing some amount of symmetry, with the sphere and its large group of rotations being the most symmetric example.<br/><br/>These research projects bring homotopy-theoretic tools into the approach of Grove and Ziller to the study of Riemannian manifolds of non-negative curvature.  Some of the questions to be studied follow on well-known theorems and conjectures of Adem, Adams, and Chern.  In particular, a generalization is suggested of Adams' theorem on singly-generated cohomology rings and generalizations in the presence of symmetry for Chern's problem on the fundamental groups of positively curved manifolds are considered."

One central problem is to understand whether two solutions of these equations on a closed 4-dimensional space can always be continuously deformed into one another. Another key problem is to completely understand which 4-dimensional spaces carry solutions of these equations. Answers to these and related questions would be of fundamental interest not only in pure mathematics, but also in theoretical physics, where such problems arise in connection with theories of quantum gravity.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study a family of related problems in 4-dimensional global Riemannian geometry, focusing on existence, moduli, and detailed structure of Einstein metrics and other Bach-flat metrics on smooth compact 4-manifolds. The primary goal of this research program is to discover and elucidate fundamental links between the curvature of a Riemannian 4-manifold and the differential topology of the underlying space. The interplay between geometry and topology that occurs in dimension four is qualitatively different from what occurs other dimensions, and a deeper understanding of this phenomenon could have significant repercussions in differential topology. Related problems in higher-dimensional geometry will therefore also be considered when it becomes helpful to frame key issues in a broader context."

Differential geometry is the key mathematics in Einstein's theory of relativity, being used to describe the curvature of space-time in the presence of a body of mass and energy. As such, understanding the geometry and topology of manifolds is a fundamental problem in science. This project will focus on studying the behavior of evolution equations on manifolds. Geometric flows have proved to be very important in mathematics, in particular, Ricci flow has been very popular for its use in the resolution of some central problems, such as the long standing Poincare conjecture. Geometric flows can be used to study a fundamental question of geometry, which is to find canonical metrics on a given manifold. The Ricci flow proposes to do this in an analytic way, by flowing a given metric in time towards an improved, canonical one. This proposal will investigate the formation of singularities along the flow and will attempt to understand them in dimension four. There are possible applications of this study to theoretical physics, because Ricci flow can be seen as the renormalization group flow in string theory. Other related flows, like mean curvature flow, have further remarkable applications to other fields, such as in computer visualization, for eliminating noise, or in metallurgy, for heat treatment of metals. The outreach components of this project disseminate the results to general public and contribute to developing of young talent.<br/><br/>Ricci flow was introduced by Hamilton in the early eighties, in a fundamental work devoted to understanding positively curved three dimensional manifolds. It became clear later that if one flows an arbitrary metric on a given manifold, the flow will generally develop singularities. One needs to understand these singularities in order to continue the flow, and to not loose any significant topological information about the space. The singularities of Ricci flow are modeled by Ricci solitons, which are fixed points of the flow, modulo diffeomorphisms and scalings. Perelman classified three dimensional shrinking Ricci solitons, and used this classification in the resolution of the Poincare conjecture. This has attracted much attention on the higher dimensional problem, and its applications. The goal of this project is to understand the structure and properties of Ricci solitons, in arbitrary dimension. This will lead to a better understanding of how large the space of  Ricci solitons is. The study will focus in particular on complete four dimensional shrinking Ricci solitons. There are significant new challenges to this problem, in particular, there exist higher dimensional examples of Ricci solitons which are not positively curved. This principal investigator will attempt to understand the asymptotic geometry of complete four dimensional shrinking Ricci solitons, which is key information for their ultimate classification."

This field of mathematics continues to evolve and surprise. During he first week of the activity (the school), international experts in the field will give several mini-courses for young researchers from across the globe. The workshop, held during the second week, will be where established researchers will exchange their newest results in this field. Both activities will enhance communication between researchers from the U.S. and the rest of the world, especially young researchers from historically underrepresented groups and countries. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics will host the School and Workshop on Geometry Discrete Actions from 24 August to 4 September 2015 in Trieste, Italy. The organizers of the school and workshop are Bertran Deroin (Ecole Normale Superieure, France), Todd A. Drumm (Howard University, DC, USA), John Parker (University of Durham, UK), and Jose Seade (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico). Discrete actions on geometric spaces are of historic and current interest in mathematics. Students of mathematics are often first introduced these ideas with tilings of the plane, but the complexity of the actions and the geometries considered have been expanded on many times over.  The interconnections between seemingly disparate schools of thought are a hallmark of this field, as is the interaction between the geometric and more dynamical properties of the discrete actions. The relatively newer studies of Character Varieties and Higher Teichmuller Theory are a natural and fertile continuation of this tradition. The general themes for this activity were inspired by the Sullivan-McMullen dictionary in complex dimension 2. This school and workshop will be a unique blend of complex geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and Lorentzian geometry.  The purpose of this activity is to introduce young mathematicians to the themes of this activity and present some of recent developments in these fields of study. The school will consist of 5 short courses will include courses on Hyperbolic Surfaces, Lorentzian Geometry, Complex Hyperbolic Geometry< Kleinian Groups, and Character Varieties. These courses will be aimed at the upper graduate student level and will serve as an introduction to current research. The workshop, held during the second week of the activity, will concentrate on new results by invited researchers. Young mathematicians and established researchers will benefit from seeing presentation on the latest results. At the end of the conference, a session will be devoted to open problems related to the themes of the activity. The interaction between researchers working in developing countries, European researchers and U.S.-based researchers is an especially important part of activity. <br/><br/>The location of the school at workshop at ICTP, whose website <www.ictp.it> contains additional information about the institute, plays a vital role in this mission."

This phenomenon, which acquired the metaphorical name ""mirror symmetry,"" led to extraordinarily prescient mathematical predictions about the geometries (""Calabi-Yau manifolds"") involved in such theories. In 1994, Maxim Kontsevich proposed an organizing framework for multiple mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in his ""homological mirror symmetry"" (HMS) conjecture, which, he said, would ""unveil the mystery of mirror symmetry.""  At the time, one of the two main mathematical notions invoked by HMS, the ""Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold,"" was new and undeveloped, and it was very difficult both to prove instances of Kontsevich's conjecture and to deduce consequences of it.  Recent developments in the mathematics of Fukaya categories have changed that.  At the center of this CAREER project is a program to realize Kontsevich's vision. The PI and collaborators have formulated a notion of ""core homological mirror symmetry,"" and the program aims to show that if core HMS holds for a particular mirror pair then many other facets of mirror symmetry naturally follow as logical consequences.  The project includes support for graduate students working with the PI, which will assist them at the beginning of their research careers, and support for the development of a coherent honors program for mathematics undergraduates.<br/><br/>The main strand of the research program concerns mirror symmetry, primarily for Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds.  The program (underway in work of the PI and collaborators Sheridan and Ganatra) studies the consequences of ""core homological mirror symmetry"" for a given pair of polarized CY manifolds, which roughly says that one can match the tensor powers of the polarizing line bundle over one of these two with some collection of Lagrangian submanifolds of the other in a way that respects categorical structures. This hypothesis is quite natural in light of geometric approaches to mirror pairs based on the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow philosophy, though currently only proven in a few cases. We aim to show that core HMS implies full HMS and several aspects of ""closed-string"" mirror symmetry, notably the normalization of the holomorphic volume form and the precise form of the mirror map. This has become feasible in light of recents developments, due principally to Abouzaid, relating the geometric ""open-closed string map,"" from quantum cohomology to Hochschild homology of the Fukaya category, to the categorical property of ""homological smoothness"" of the Fukaya category. A key aim is to give a ""conceptual"" proof that the generating function for the numbers of rational curves on a quintic 3-fold equals the Yukawa coupling of its mirror -- a proof that does not rely on calculating the two sides. This research gives key roles to symplectic topology, pseudo-holomorphic curves, and symplectic Floer cohomology. Those techniques are equally important in a second strand, which is to develop Floer-thoeretic 3-manifold invariants on similar lines to Heegaard Floer theory but based not on symmetric products of a Heegaard surface (viewed as a complex curve), but rather on moduli spaces of rank 2 holomorphic bundles with section over such curves. Such invariants may serve to mediate between Heegaard and instanton versions of Floer theory for 3-manifolds."

The large N limit of the project title refers to 1/h where h is Planck's constant, a very small physical constant that measures the importance of quantum mechanical effects in a physical process.  Quantum effects are important at the atomic level, but not for macroscopic objects such as cars, whose motion is described by classical mechanics (Newton's laws).  As h tends to 0, or N = 1/h tends to infinity, quantum mechanical models tend to classical counterparts. Analogous situations arise in many areas of mathematics and physics whenever there is a large parameter N so that the N tends to infinity limit shares the principal features of the limit as quantum mechanics tends to classical mechanics. In geometry, N represents the degree of a polynomial. In Kaehler geometry, there are special metrics known as Bergman metrics that are analogous to polynomials of degree N. Any metric may be approximated by the polynomial-like Bergman metrics of degree N. The conference is devoted to the many uses of this approximation in geometry and physics, ranging from quantum gravity to the quantum Hall effect. <br/><br/>In Kaehler geometry, the geometric quantization of a Kaehler manifold is the space of holomorphic sections of the Nth power of a positive Hermitian line bundle L over a Kaehler manifold whose curvature form is the Kaehler form. In the Tian-Yau-Donaldson program of relating stability to extremal metrics, a central role is played by the approximation of general Kaehler metrics in the class by Bergman metrics of degree N. The Bergman metrics of degree N are special Kaehler metrics induced by holomorphic embeddings of M into complex projective space of dimension by bases of holomorphic sections of the Nth power of L.  The holomorphic embedding is essentially the map z -> B(N, w, z) where B is the Bergman kernel, i.e., the orthogonal projection onto the space of holomorphic sections of the Nth power of L.  Bergman kernels and metrics arise in physics as well as geometry. For instance, the Laughlin wave function of the fractional quantum Hall effect on a curved surface is intimately related to the Bergman kernel, with N given by the number of electrons on the surface. Bergman kernels and metrics also give a new approach to defining probability measures on the space of all Kaehler metrics, which is expected to be related to quantum gravity.

Schrodinger introduced quantum mechanics in 1927 to solve the puzzle of how an electron can be moving and stationary at the same time. His answer was that a quantum particle with a definite energy can only exist in a stationary state, the physics word for an eigenfunction of the Schrodinger operator governing the physics. The problem is that eigenfunctions are very hard to visualize and understand. Global Harmonic Analysis is about making rigorous relations between these eigenfunctions and the classical mechanics underlying the physical system. The projects in the proposal address two opposite kinds of questions: (i) how large can the eigenfunction be, and how are the points where it is large distributed? These are the points where it is  most probable to find the particle. (ii) How are the points where the eigenfunction is zero distributed? These are the  points where it is least likely to find the particle. <br/><br/>Global Harmonic Analysis is the use of the long-time dynamics of the geodesic flow of a Riemannian manifold to understand the high-frequency asymptotics of eigenfunctions. Two of the most important problems are (1) to analyze Lp norms of eigenfunctions and (2) to analyze nodal sets and critical point sets. For large p, Sogge and the PI have shown that the universal Lp bounds are only obtained if there exists a self-focal point x where a positive measure of geodesics from x loop back to x. In recent work, The PI showed that if the metric is real analytic, then all geodesics loop back and the first return map preserves a finite measure on the unit tangent space at x in the class of Lebesgue measure. In two dimensions, it follows that all geodesics through x are smoothly closed. One project is to generalize the last result to higher dimensions and smooth metrics. It is also very interesting to study low Lp norms and we are working with the Kakeya-Nikodym maximal function to do that. Regarding nodal and critical point sets, J. Jung and the PI have recently shown that the number of nodal domains of Neumann or Dirichlet eigenfunctions on non-positively curved surfaces with non-empty concave boundary must tend to infinity with the eigenvalue. It was also showed that the eigenfunctions have many critical points. In future work, the PI shall prove a more quantitative result and to study the higher dimensional case. The PI is also using holomorphic extensions of eigenfunction in the real analytic case to gain more control over nodal and critical point sets."

Mathematically the concept of curvature plays the central role. Partial differential equations (PDEs) arise naturally from many fundamental questions in Differential Geometry, notably in understanding a geometric space in terms of its curvature or finding an optimal geometric structure on a given space. The PI will focus on two important examples: minimal submanifolds and geometric flows. Minimal submanifolds are subspaces that locally minimize area (or volume). They have been studied since the work of Euler and Lagrange, yielding many applications to geometry and other related fields such as low-dimensional topology and general relativity. Moreover, they are important models for many interesting non-linear phenomena in nature and a variety of ideas developed in their study have turned out to be key in the calculus of variations, geometric PDEs, and mathematical physics. A geometric flow, on the other hand, is a process of deforming a given geometry through a parabolic system of PDEs coming from curvature. A prominent example is the flow by the Ricci curvature, or Ricci flow, which has had seminal consequences to the geometrization of three-dimensional spaces by the work of Hamilton and Perelman. <br/><br/>One of the tenets of this research project is that the existence of minimal submanifolds of certain topological and Morse index type can impose restrictions on the curvature of the ambient manifold, and vice-versa. The PI will investigate several questions relating the Morse index and the topology of minimal submanifolds in presence of positive curvature. Another aspect is the singularity formation phenomena in geometric flows, with a focus on the profiles of singularities and their rigidity and stability properties."

The key concept involved is that of a so-called curvature, the simplest kind being the scalar curvature function on a space. The extremal cases are often the most interesting to study. In particular, the existence of a constant scalar curvature metric is of a major importance in Differential Geometry. It has a strong impact on other fields of sciences such as physics. For instance, the work of Calabi-Yau directly provided a mathematical foundation in mirror symmetry. According to A. Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of the space-time. Therefore, the research in complex geometry is crucially important in physics and cosmology. The research proposed here also has impacts on algebraic geometry and partial differential equations. The project has an integrated education component which will enable the PI to continue supporting graduate students financially to pursue their research. <br/><br/>In recent years, striking progress has been made in Kaehler geometry, particularly on  the existence of the Kaehler-Einstein metrics and the limiting behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci flow solution, both in Fano manifolds.  More exciting progress will follow after these works in this and adjacent area. In Kaehler geometry, the focus of the field is now on the existence of constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics which is more general and harder than the existence of the Kaehler-Einstein metrics. This program on constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics, which was first proposed by E. Calabi in 1950s, amounts to solving a 4th-order partial differential equation which naturally interacts with metric geometry as well as algebraic geometry. In this project, the PI will study a network of problems centering around the existence of constant scalar curvature metrics and other related areas.

The first area is called symplectic geometry and the second area is called algebraic geometry. Symplectic geometry involves the study of classical physical systems, for instance pendulums, moving particles, other devices with possibly many moving parts. It gives a nice way of describing the position and velocity of these systems in a unified way. Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of certain fundamental equations called polynomial equations. These equations are used in many areas of mathematics, and even outside of mathematics, such as physics and computer science.  The solutions to these equations have a shape, which in some places is a nice smooth object, but also can have regions which are not smooth called singular points. In this project, we explore a deep relationship between these singular points and certain families of classical physical systems. Many properties of singularities have corresponding purely dynamical interpretations in these physical systems which will be explored further as very little is currently known. The study of singularities is especially important in algebraic geometry at the moment due to recent advances in an program called the minimal model program. Part of this project also involves teaching graduate students how to use various fundamental tools from symplectic geometry. Such tools are featured in this program.<br/> <br/>The primary aim of this project is to understand the relationship between symplectic/contact geometry and affine algebraic geometry. This relationship will be studied using pseudo-holomorphic methods that were originally introduced by Gromov and have now developed into important tools such as Gromov-Witten invariants, Floer homology, and Symplectic Field Theory. Mumford gave us a criterion to tell us when a complex surface is smooth at a particular point or not from its link. The PI proved a higher dimensional version of Mumford's result where the link now has a natural contact structure. Part of the aim of this proposal is to start a program relating the algebraic properties of higher dimensional singularities with their links as contact manifolds in the same way that Mumford's paper did so for surface singularities. Much of this work is also directly related to recent advances in the minimal model program.  As a starting point we hope to generalize at least parts of a result by Neumann giving us the topology of a resolution from the link. In a related project, we hope to understand the McKay correspondence for quotient singularities with crepant resolutions using Floer theoretic ideas. This might lead us to extend this correspondence to quotient singularities that do not have crepant resolutions, and even to more general singularities. The PI will give many examples of contact manifolds not contactomorphic to links of singularities.  The PI will also look at affine varieties from a symplectic perspective by trying to understand how properties such as log Kodaira dimension and rational connectedness relate to the symplectic structure. This project also involves teaching graduate students how to apply pseudo-holomorphic methods in various situations."

Complex geometry aims to study the shapes of complex manifolds through distances and angles; mathematically these measurements are called Khler metrics. In the physics context, manifolds that carry a metric that is both a Khler metric and an Einstein metric are of interest; these are called Khler-Einstein metrics. This project considers several central problems in complex geometry, both from analytic and algebraic points of view, and builds around the notion of a so-called singular Khler-Einstein metric. This relatively recent notion has been introduced in an attempt to extendi Yau's theorem on the resolution of Calabi's conjecture to singular settings directly coming from algebraic geometry, and more precisely birational (complex) geometry. A major current challenge consists of constructing these objects in various contexts and trying to understand their behavior; a good understanding of the behavior of singular Khler-Einstein metrics would have important consequences both in complex geometry as well as in areas of theoretical physics, such as string theory. Moreover, studying families of singular Khler-Einstein metrics is very closely linked with the moduli theory, one of the main components of algebraic geometry. It is expected that results of the project concerning applications of singular Khler-Einstein metrics will advance knowledge in the theory of singular spaces, in analytic and algebraic geometry, and in other areas of mathematics and physics.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three central topics: behavior of the Khler-Einstein metrics near the singularities of the variety, families and degenerations of singular Khler-Einstein metrics, and applications of the Khler-Einstein theory to algebraic geometry. The first circle of ideas is about finding models for Khler-Einstein metrics near their singularities. The singularities can arise from those of the variety or from the boundary divisor of the pair to consider. The project examines the general case of (semi) log canonical pairs, through past results of the PI and others, as well as numerous questions that arise in the these works. The topics include improving the pluripotential methods to get sharper estimates, understanding the (Riemannian) geometry of the singular Khler-Einstein metrics by relating singularities and completeness, and deriving higher regularity at the singular points. The second circle of ideas centers on families of singular Khler-Einstein metrics, and in particular studying the moduli space of canonically polarized varieties from a differential geometric point of view through Weil-Petersson geometry. Other related questions are about Gromov-Hausdorff (or more refined) convergence of conic Khler-Einstein metrics. The hope is that the recent developments in pluripotential theory should give a new angle to tackle these problems. The third circle of ideas focuses on various applications of singular Khler-Einstein metrics, particularly in algebraic geometry. Typical questions that arise in the project concern vanishing/parallelism theorems or semi-stability properties of the tangent sheaf of singular varieties. Here again, a consequent part of the questions is motivated by recent progress in the theory of Monge-Ampre equations."

The proposed work addresses the relationship between Hodge theory and representation theory, with a focus on those aspects that may be described using complex geometry. (The Hodge theory of algebraic varieties will not be addressed: the emphasis is on Hodge structures as objects of independent interest.)  In the classical case that the Hodge domain D is a Hermitian symmetric space that may be equivariantly embedded in Siegel's upper-half space, the relation between Hodge theory and the geometric and arithmetic properties of a variety is a deep and extensively researched subject. The area is considerably less developed in the non-classical case, and it is generally felt that the principle obstacle to generalizing the theory (arithmetic properties, automorphic forms, theory of Shimura varieties, et cetera) is our limited understanding of the system of differential equations governing variations of Hodge structure.  The principle motivation and objective of this project is to better understand this system, the complex geometry of the Hodge domain D, and the associated representation theory in the non-classical setting.<br/><br/>Hodge theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical subjects, including Algebraic Geometry, Complex Geometry, Number Theory and Representation Theory.  This rich confluence makes the subject a fertile and influential area of research.  The underlying motivation to study variations of Hodge structure (a dominant theme in this proposal) is to understand moduli of algebraic varieties.  Algebraic varieties arise as the solution spaces to polynomial equations.  The ability to understand and manipulate solutions of systems of polynomial equations is essential in many areas of engineering, science and mathematics."

Geometric flows, such as those addressed in this proposal, have applications to many branches of science, including materials science and cosmology. The research in this proposal will enhance the theoretical understanding of such flows. The Ricci flow is fundamental in modern geometry. Most of the work on Ricci flow has been done on smooth Ricci flows or Ricci flows with surgery. On the other hand, many partial differential equations have a well-defined class of singular solutions. The proposed work will explore a remarkable class of singular solutions for the three-dimensional Ricci flow. Similarly, for many partial differential equations, there are good notions of weak solutions. Understanding limits of Ricci flow with surgery may shed light on the problem of developing a good notion of weak Ricci flow. The Einstein flow is a geometric flow with very different features than parabolic flows. The proposed research will elucidate some general features of the Einstein flow. The long-time behavior of vacuum spacetimes is of evident interest in cosmology. Finding a framework for differential K-theory based on infinite-dimensional cocycles will lead to new directions in local index theory and the associated functional analysis.

The Einstein flow is a flow which describes the long-time behavior of a vacuum spacetime that has a foliation by constant mean curvature spatial hypersurfaces.

The aforementioned linear operators prescribe the change in the shape of space, change quantified in terms of certain curvature measurement by means of a differential equation that is typically nonlinear. A long-term goal of this study is to find conditions under which these curvature equations are solvable and to study the quality of the solution. Successful results in the proposed project will enrich the subject of conformal geometry by providing a large new family of examples of special Einstein spaces that are of interest to a wide audience of mathematicians, as well as to mathematical physicists. In addition to contributing directly to the field of conformal geometry, this project will help train a number of graduate students and postdocs, who will have the dual role of researchers and educators of the next generation of mathematicians. The extensive lecture course conducted by the principal investigators contributes to the mathematical education of scientists in several geographic areas.<br/><br/>A basic tool for this project is a version of a well-known inequality, the Sobolev inequality, that controls the size of a function in terms of a measurement of its variation.

A secondary objective of the project is to improve upon previous work of the principal investigators in order to obtain bounds for a family of conformally compact Einstein spaces, bounds that might eventually allow one to construct of a large family of such spaces, as predicted by physicists.  A third objective is to broaden the conditions under which one can assert the validity of a strong maximum principle for fourth-order partial differential equations, a technical device that only became available because of prior work by the prinicipal investigators.

However in order to use holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry, a substantial amount of analysis is needed to regularize the moduli spaces of holomorphic curves. In the 80's and 90's these moduli spaces were regularized using geometric perturbation techniques. However since then, symplectic geometry has moved beyond the scope of problems to which geometric perturbation techniques are applicable, leaving a serious gap in the foundations of the subject. Perhaps the most successful and promising technology for filling this gap is the polyfold theory of Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder. The conference has two main goals. The first goal is to educate a large audience in polyfold theory, in order to enable more researchers to begin developing and using these new techniques. The second goal is to connect the abstract perturbations of polyfolds to the classical geometric perturbations in order to facilitate computations of invariants."

In physics, they are used to describe the space-time in Einstein's theory of general relativity. In mathematics, they are basic building blocks of more complicated geometries. The study of Einstein manifolds is thus a basic problem in geometry. One effective way to construct Einstein manifolds is to require that the underlying manifold has a complex algebraic structure. In other words, the points of such a manifold are complex-valued solutions of polynomial equations. Einstein metrics on such algebraic manifolds are called Kaehler-Einstein metrics. In the late 70s, Aubin and Yau constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with negative Ricci curvatures. Yau also constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with zero Ricci curvatures, which are now called Calabi-Yau metrics and play important roles in the string theory of physics. On the other hand, only recently has people pinned down a sufficient and necessary condition, called K-stability, for the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics with positive Ricci curvatures for a class of algebraic manifolds called Fano manifolds. This result depends on the work of many people, most importantly by Tian and Donaldson. After these discoveries, we want to further our understandings of such Kaehler-Einstein metrics and the obstructions to their existence. These problems are the main concerns of the proposal. The study of these Kaehler-Einstein metrics will greatly improve our understanding of Einstein manifolds important in both physics and mathematics. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PI will study the following closely related problems. 1.Various continuity methods of partial differential equations are used to solve the Kaehler-Einstein equation. The recent breakthroughs give qualitative pictures of blow up behaviors and convergences of these continuity methods. However, deeper quantitative understandings of the blow up behaviors or singularity forming phenomena are needed. The PI has studied in detail such quantitative properties for toric Fano manifolds. The PI will study the singularities forming processes for a broader class of Fano manifolds. The PI will also study the classification of the singularities formed in low dimensions by combining the methods from Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry. 2.The PI will study concrete constructions of Kaehler-Einstein metrics and related canonical metrics. On the one hand, the PI likes to extend the construction of toric Kaehler-Einstein metrics to other Kaehler-Einstein metrics with large symmetries, for example, on spherical varieties. On the other hand, the PI will study the classification of Sasaki-Einstein metrics with large symmetries in low dimensions based on his calculations of important examples. Related methods will also be applied to construct Kaehler-Ricci solitons and extremal Kaehler metrics. 3.The PI will study the deformations of canonical Kaehler metrics including Kaehler-Einstein metrics and Kaehler-Ricci solitons, and to understand the moduli spaces of these canonical Kaehler metrics. He will also study the singularities on the boundaries of these moduli spaces. 4.The PI and his collaborator will study the K-stability using algebraic geometry based on their previous work on K-stability.

The first part concerns what happens to a hypersurface under the mean curvature flow. This part is mostly concerned with hypersurfaces that are in general or generic position before the flow starts.  The mean curvature flow (MCF) is the negative gradient flow of volume, so any hypersurface flows through hypersurfaces in the direction of steepest descent for volume and eventually becomes extinct in finite time.  The project further develops the theory of generic MCF, extending recent results to other flows.  A second part of the project concerns Ricci curvature. Previously estimates with applications have been obtained by the PI and Naber, and recently monotonicity formulas have been proved by the PI and used with Minicozzi to settle a long standing open problem about uniqueness of tangent cones of Einstein metrics. This part of the project discusses possible extensions and related conjectures.  The third part of the project concerns the longstanding classification problem in the theory of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds: to exhibit for each closed 3-manifold a complete list, without duplication, of all its irreducible Heegaard splittings, up to isotopy. The final and smaller part of the proposal is about bounds for nodal sets (or zero sets) of eigenfunctions."

Higgs bundles, the solutions to these equations over a two-dimensional space, appear at the interface of geometry, physics, and representation theory. Understanding Higgs bundles through spectral data allows one to see a beautiful interplay between physical objects and properties of different Higgs bundles. This approach is appealing not only because of its intrinsic interest, but also because it is wonderfully suited for collaborations among several branches of mathematics and physics. The main goal of the project is to understand how Higgs bundles and their spectral data can provide new tools to study various geometric and physical questions. <br/><br/>Remarkably, there are often elegant and simple characterizations of topological invariants of the moduli space of surface group representations (and of branes in the A- or B-model) in terms of combinatorial and geometric values associated to the spectral data of the corresponding Higgs bundles. The spectral data approach may be extended to Higgs bundles with singularities, and the PI is currently carrying out a program to do so. By considering the hyperkahler structure of the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles, the PI and a collaborator constructed a triple of natural anti-holomorphic involutions whose fixed point sets are new examples of branes in the A-model and B-model, some of them closely related to the representation variety of 3-manifolds. Obtaining a better understanding of the relation between the topology of 3-manifolds and subspaces of Higgs bundles is something the PI is pursuing, in particular by studying the relation of Higgs bundles with knot and graph compliments. Finally, the PI is also considering Langlands duality by looking at the Fourier-Mukai transform on the spectral data for the families of branes, which should provide some of the necessary objects needed for quantization of character varieties and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles from the perspective of curve and brane quantization."

For example the value of a security, or its variance might be constrained to be non-negative, whereas the frequency of a gene must lie between 0 and 1. The actual path that the value of a particular security, or the prevalence of an allele in a single population follow is very complicated and, indeed, fundamentally unpredictable. Collectively these paths constitute what is called a stochastic process. While the time course of a single path is unpredictable, the statistical properties of the whole family of possible paths can often be shown to satisfy partial differential equations, which allow for their detailed analysis. The main goal of Dr. Epstein's research is to understand the solutions of the types of equations that arise in these contexts.  This is challenging because the equations display degeneracies connected to the fact that the paths are constrained to lie in certain regions of space, like triangles and tetrahedra, which themselves have non-smooth boundaries.  Dr. Epstein is trying to develop a detailed enough understanding of these equations to develop incisive numerical tools for use by biologists and population geneticists.<br/><br/>A principal focus of Dr. Epstein's research is to understand the detailed analytic properties of the solutions to Kimura diffusion equations, which arise as limiting cases of Wright-Fisher Markov models.  Working jointly with collaborators for the past seven years, he has established analytic foundations for this natural class of equations, on a natural class of domains. In their recent work it became clear that the class of operators needed to be expanded to include equations with somewhat singular coefficients, which are needed for the analysis of problems that arise in more realistic applications to Probability, Mathematical Finance and Population Biology. Much of the work proposed herein deals with developing analytic tools to address these sorts of real world problems. This will include the analysis of such quantities as the heat kernel, stationary measures, probabilities of fixation, and times to fixation. Beyond the abstract analytic work, Dr. Epstein will also develop numerical algorithms to accurately solve Kimura diffusion equations and the associated elliptic problems that arise in the study of statistical property of such processes in cases of genuine applied interest. Dr. Epstein will also pursue the analytic aspects of stable, accurate numerical methods for solving time-dependent problems in electromagnetics. This involves finding novel representations of solutions to the wave equation and full Maxwell equations, which in turn lead to numerical methods with better accuracy and stability properties than pre-existing approaches."

The long-time behavior of wave equations on smooth spaces is well-understood in many regards, but the presence of singularities raises many unresolved problems.  The singularities studied include boundaries, cone points, and large-scale structures ""at infinity."" These projects are of interest to mathematicians and physicists working in partial differential equations, geometry, general relativity, and numerical analysis.

Other than on perturbations of Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, very little fine information is known about the long-time behavior of waves.  Many facts that are known to hold for the linear wave equation in flat space are largely unknown when the underlying spacetime on which the evolution takes place is instead time-dependent or singular. The investigator will employ microlocal, or phase space, techniques to explore problems in these areas.  In particular, the investigator will address problems concerning (1) wave decay on curved spacetimes such as those arising in general relativity, (2) wave maps, or nonlinear sigma models in the language of quantum field theory, on conic surfaces, and (3) boundary value problems for the Helmholtz equation arising in numerical analysis."

Werner <br/><br/>These research projects are in asymptotic geometric analysis and affine convex geometry. One main emphasis of the principal investigator's research is on high-dimensional objects and phenomena. This leads to applications of her research in areas as diverse as physics, biology and medicine, computer science, optimization and economics, and material science: Indeed, a mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if one wants to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow one to predict its future motion from position and velocity one would need six separate numbers in all.  If one wants to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then one will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases which are not visible in low dimensions.  We can exploit those patters thus taking advantage of the ""curse of dimensionality"" to make it the ""blessing of dimensionality"".  It is one purpose of this grant to study such high dimensional phenomena.<br/><br/>Important features of the proposed project are, on the one hand, emphasis on affine invariant and high dimensional objects and phenomena, and, on the other hand, links with other areas of mathematics and mathematical sciences (such as probability, statistics, information theory and quantum information theory). Topics to be studied include: Entropies for convex bodies and log concave functions, affine invariants and their inequalities, structural properties of convex bodies, probabilistic methods in convexity and geometric aspects related to optimization, Banach spaces, and quantum information theory. A focus of this research program is the development of affine invariants and their related inequalities.  The principal investigator and her collaborators started the systematic study of (affine invariant) functionals associated with convex bodies and log concave functions and their corresponding inequalities. Among the most important such functionals for convex bodies are affine surface area and p-affine surface area.  Those were recently extended to log concave functions by the PI and her collaborators.  The affine isoperimetric inequalities related to the affine surface areas are more powerful than their Euclidean relatives and related to other important inequalities (e.g., the Santalo- and Inverse Santalo-inequalities). The latter is related to Mahler's conjecture, which is still open in dimension three and higher.  Connections, observed recently by the PI, between affine surface areas and Renyi entropy allow interactions between information theory, and convex affine geometry."

This research project investigates problems centering around the Ricci flow, which is in turn a natural way to evolve Riemannian metrics in their underlying space.  The concept of Ricci flow was invented by R. Hamilton in 1982 and has had wide applications in mathematics since then. For instance, the Ricci flow has had a profound and far-reaching impact on 3-dimensional geometry and topology, as evidenced by G. Perelman's solution to the Poincare conjecture in 2003. The investigator will study the applications of the Ricci flow in algebraic geometry and 4-dimensional topology. These applications will deepen our understanding of several related subjects, including partial differential equations, probability, complex analysis, and theoretical physics. By organizing conferences and seminars, the PI will motivate graduate students to join this research endeavor. Moreover, the PI will present the work to undergraduate students and the general public. <br/><br/>The investigator will continue developing tools based on the Ricci flow. In particular, he will refine and localize the existing estimates in Ricci flow, for the purpose of applying Ricci flow in algebraic geometry and 4-dimension topology. He will generalize the pseudo-locality theorem of Perelman, and find the relationships between Ricci flow theory and the theory of metric spaces with lower bound of Ricci curvatures, i.e., the Cheeger-Colding theory. He will continue to develop the special estimates in the Kahler Ricci flow. Among other things, he will aim to combine the flow version of Chen-Lu inequality with other estimates. Based on the improved estimates, the PI will aim to understand the relationship between the minimal model program in algebraic geometry and the Kahler Ricci flow. He will also determine if some of the results in the Cheeger-Colding theory can be reproved using the Ricci flow method. Finally, the PI intends to study the expected deep connections between the Ricci flow and probability theory."

Practical issues include developing new, efficient algorithms for computations that need to be done frequently  (such as multiplying matrices), as well as determining whether more efficient algorithms than the ones already known may exist. The theoretical aspects include  questions almost philosophical in nature, such as: Is there really a difference between  intuition and systematic problem solving? (This question was asked by Godel and contributed to the development of the famous P versus NP conjecture.) The project will use modern mathematical tools to address these questions, more specifically, algebraic geometry and representation theory. Although the research for this project is driven by questions from computer science, these questions are of interest to mathematics in their own right  and have the potential to guide future mathematical research in the way physics has done in recent years.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two central questions in complexity theory: the complexity of matrix multiplication and the Geometric Complexity Theory approach to Valiant's conjectures. Regarding matrix multiplication, linear algebra is central to all applications of mathematics,  and matrix multiplication is the essential operation of linear algebra.  In 1969 Strassen discovered  a new algorithm to multiply matrices significantly faster than the standard algorithm. This and subsequent work has led to the astounding  conjecture that asymptotically, it is essentially almost as easy to multiply matrices as it is to add them. It is a central question  to determine just how efficiently one can multiply matrices, both practically and asymptotically.  This project will prove bounds for how efficiently  matrices can be multiplied. Regarding Geometric Complexity Theory, a central question in theoretical computer science is whether brute force calculations can be avoided in problems such as the traveling salesman problem. This is the essence of the P versus NP  conjecture. The   Geometric Complexity Theory  (GCT) program  addresses such  questions  using geometric methods. GCT touches on central questions in algebraic geometry, differential geometry, representation theory and combinatorics. The goals  of this project are (i)  to better establish the mathematical foundations of GCT by solving open problems in combinatorics and classical algebraic   geometry and (ii) to solve complexity problems considered more tractable, such as determining whether or not the determinant polynomial admits a small formula."

The PI studies submanifolds of Euclidean space with nonnegative curvature and their rigidity properties. In recent years the Ricci flow has found many important applications in geometry. The PI plans to study further applications of such flows or possible modifications to the existence problem in positive curvature.

A simple example is the collection of isometry classes of metric structures on a circle - these are determined by the circumference of the circle and so correspond to the open line of all positive real numbers; in this example a deformation would be an expansion or contraction of one circle to another of larger or smaller circumference.

These invariants have been a central object of study in several fields, from their origins in theoretical physics (string theory) to algebraic and symplectic geometries.  Computing such numbers for general spaces is a difficult task. For spaces with symmetries, gauged Gromov Witten theory has proven to be a far-reaching tool used to systematically understand the behavior of Gromov-Witten  invariants as well as to compute them.

The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world such as angles, distances and properties of certain shapes. Differential geometry was developed to use the tools of calculus to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity, or the properties of soap bubbles (which turn out to be related to the equations describing black holes). In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations.  The research in this project involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study.  <br/><br/>The functional determinant of an elliptic operator is a problem originating in spectral theory and mathematical physics, and the analysis of the particular problem the PI considers is a variational problem leading to a fourth order elliptic equation. The associated Lagrangian is unbounded, and the existence of solutions and their qualitative properties is highly nontrivial. Similar equations are used to model the properties of thin films. Another problem the PI studies concerns the moduli space of Riemannian metrics that are critical points of functionals given by the integral of quadratic curvature quantities. In work of the PI with J. Viaclovsky, they constructed new examples of critical points, but this construction naturally leads to various conjectures about the moduli space of solutions. An important example of a quadratic curvature functional is the Weyl functional. Critical points are called Bach-flat metrics, and include important examples such as self-dual metrics. One moduli space problem the PI studies is a question of Singer about the linearized problem for self-dual manifolds of positive scalar curvature."

To date the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 52 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington. By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and young people. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select young faculty at these institutions. <br/><br/>The theme of the upcoming conference at Rice University will concentrate on ""Metric and Conformal Geometry"". Accelerated by the work of Gromov, metric techniques have gained an important place in Riemannian geometry, especially in the study of conformal structures. This development has deeply affected understanding, particularly of Teichmuller spaces, conformal dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. In recent years, some of these metric techniques have also been important in the study of certain random conformal processes. The conference features leading researchers in these various fields, each of which has roots in metric and conformal geometry. <br/><br/>http://math.rice.edu/NewsEvents/Conferences/TGTC2015/"

These spaces will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean) n-dimensional spaces and may be very complicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere.  Higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology is defined through contact and symplectic geometry, which in turn are closely related to mathematical physics and string theory.  These studies in higher dimensions should in turn contribute significantly towards our understanding of low-dimensional (i.e., 3- and 4-dimensional) shapes, from the knotting of DNA at the microscopic level to the shape of the universe at the macroscopic level. <br/><br/>The PI will study contact and symplectic geometry in higher dimensions through a higher-dimensional generalization of Heegaard Floer homology.  Heegaard Floer homology, due to Ozsvth and Szab, is a package of invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces as well as knots and links in 3-space, which is extremely effective at distinguishing these spaces and knots and links from one another.  The main goal of the PI's research program is to develop the theory of Heegaard Floer homology in higher dimensions, i.e., in dimensions greater than 4.  This theory is expected to yield important applications to contact and symplectic geometry in higher dimensions, which in turn are related to algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  Khovanov homology, another important invariant of knots and links in 3-space, can at least conjecturally be viewed as a special case of higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology."

In recent years many new mathematical subjects have been created due to the influence of attempts to study the nature of subatomic particles. One important example of such new mathematics is the rapidly-developing subject of Gromov-Witten theory. One reason for the importance of Gromov-Witten theory is its deep connections with many other subjects, such as string theory, integrable systems of partial differential equations, counting of geometric objects, and parameter spaces for geometric objects. Another example is mirror symmetry, which is a duality arising from physics and is interpreted in mathematics as the equivalence of two seemingly completely unrelated geometric objects. Such a highly nontrivial correspondence is extremely interesting in its own right, while also important for theoretical physics. This research project will explore several key questions in the deep relations between Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry. The research will further advance knowledge about mirror symmetry, enumeration of holomorphic disks, and the geometry of parameter spaces of surfaces, and it will also further promote the existing interactions between algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and string theory. <br/><br/>This research project aims to study several aspects of open Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry: calculations of open Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds; understanding the relations between mirror maps defined using period integrals and open Gromov-Witten invariants; proving mirror symmetry statements for open Gromow-Witten invariants of symplectic toric orbifolds; and studying the behaviors of open Gromov-Witten invariants under birational transformations. The PI plans to study open Gromov-Witten invariants by relating them to other quantities, such as closed Gromov-Witten invariants, and to derive relations among open Gromov-Witten invariants. Techniques such as virtual localization, mirror theorems, analysis of Kuranishi spaces, tropical geometry, Seidel representations, and quantum differential equations will be used in the research."

An example of a geometric problem having to do with the arrangement of shapes in space is: If one (endlessly) glues together equilateral triangles so that 7 triangles go around each vertex, is it possible to embed the resulting surface in 3-dimensional space?  An example of a problem having to do with geometric shapes in the plane is to determine the possible shapes swept out by the path of a frictionless ball as it rolls (endlessly) around the inside of a polygonal table and bounces off the sides. Such processes occur both in nature and in a purely abstract mathematical context, and often produce mysterious, intricate, and beautiful patterns. These processes have connections to number theory, geometry, and physics. This research project studies these processes via numerical simulation to generate hypotheses that are subsequently confirmed or disproved via rigorous mathematical justification.<br/><br/>Speaking more technically, the principal investigator will continue investigations into geometric dynamics, concentrating on polytope exchange transformations and outer billiards. One common theme in this work is the construction of higher dimensional compactifications of non-compact low-dimensional dynamical systems. Another common theme is the appearance of renormalization phenomena. In the situation of interest, one has a fiber bundle where the base space is the parameter space and each fiber is a polytope exchange transformation based on the parameter it lies over. The goal is then to find an auxiliary transformation of the base space which relates the dynamics at the fiber over one point to the dynamics of the fiber over the image of the point under the transformation. For instance, this seems to happen when one studies the symbolic dynamics of a process, and this project aims to find a general theory for this. The principal investigator will also study a number of geometric iterations, such as the pentagram map, a projectively natural map on the space of polygons that is related to integrable systems and cluster algebras. Finally, the principal investigator plans to attack a number of longstanding unsolved problems in geometry, such as the square peg conjecture."

In practice these equations do not always admit a solution.  Understanding the properties of spaces in which these equations have solutions, and furthermore understanding precisely the obstructions to finding solutions sheds new light on the underlying structure of the universe.  A thorough understanding of the obstructions to solving these natural equations can lead to new and exciting predictions in the fields of string theory and high energy physics.<br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes to investigate several problems concerning the geometry of Kahler manifolds using techniques from partial differential equations and algebraic geometry.  The central theme of this research is to relate the convergence or singularity formation of several geometric heat flows, such as the Kahler-Ricci flow and the J-flow, to algebraic geometry.  In the setting of the Kahler-Ricci flow it is essential to understand the algebro-geometric properties of the blow-up set for the flow at any finite time singularity.  In the non-projective setting, this involves finding transcendental approaches to algebro-geometric problems-- for example, Kawamata's base point free theorem.  In the setting of the J-flow, the convergence or singularity formation of the flow is expected to be determined by an algebro-geometric stability condition. The PI aims to investigate how this stability condition is related to the analytic behavior of the flow for large time both in specific examples, and in general."

In elementary school we learn that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle on the plane is 180 degrees. This fact characterizes Euclidean geometry, which is the model space of zero curvature.  Similarly, negatively curved geometries are characterized by the fact that the sum of the interior angles of (small non-degenerate) triangles is always less than 180 degrees.  Non-positively curved geometries are defined in the same way: the sums mentioned above are less than or equal to 180 degrees.  In this project we will try to construct more of these geometries on spaces, either on singular spaces or non-singular spaces (non-singular spaces are called manifolds).<br/><br/>Recent work has found smoothings of some of the singular metrics on hyperbolized cube manifolds produced by the methods of Charney and Davis to obtain Riemannian metrics with curvatures close to -1.  These constructions have needed relatively large pieces for the Charney-Davis hyperbolization construction and a new project seeks to eliminate this requirement.  Several projects concern the space of all negatively curved metrics on a space, addressing the generalizations to this context of the classical moduli and Teichmueller spaces.  One line of investigation continues the study of the potentially nontrivial homotopy type of the nonclassical counterparts to Teichmueller space, while another studies topological invariance: If M and N are smooth manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic, and if M supports a negatively curved Riemannian metric, must N also carry such a metric?"

Riemannian geometry provides a large and flexible extension of the classical rigid and maximally symmetric ""Euclidean,""  ""Spherical"" and ""Hyperbolic geometries,""  as well as of the theory of surfaces. The special but rich class of symmetric spaces, the closest generalizations of the sphere, Euclidean plane, and hyperbolic plane, are the jewels and cornerstones among all Riemannian spaces. They play  significant roles  in several other areas of mathematics as well, including Analysis, Algebra and Dynamics. These important objects fall into two (dual) classes referred to as ""compact type"" and ""non-compact type,"" where the members of the first are ""more curved"" than flat space and the members of the latter are ""less curved"" than flat space.  A central aim of the work is to gain new geometric and dynamic insights that will single out say the symmetric spaces of compact type among all spaces ""curved more than flat space."" Specifically, the work seeks to provide a characterization through the presence of special (so-called polar) transformations by symmetries, known to be abundant for symmetric spaces. A simple analog of the kind of characterization sought is illustrated by the striking fact that among all spaces ""curved more than the sphere of radius 1,"" only the sphere (and real projective space) support a reflection (i.e., the space is a mirror image of itself).<br/><br/>There is a well-known link, due to Dadok, between so-called polar representations and isotropy representations of  symmetric spaces. Moreover, the theory by Tits and Burns-Spatzier provides a link between irreducible symmetric spaces of non-compact type of rank at least three and irreducible compact topological spherical buildings of rank at least three. Polar actions on general Riemannian manifolds constitute a vast  extension of polar representations just maintaining the basic geometric features of the latter (having so-called sections). However, the presence of such an actions on a (1-connected) positively curved manifold forces it to be a symmetric space of rank 1 (up to diffeomorphism), unless there are codimension-one orbits. The aforementioned links  provide the frame for proving this strong ""rigidity type"" result. The primary focus of the work to be done is to describe the much larger class of nonnegatively curved manifold in the presence of a polar action. The ultimate aim is to show that the principal building blocks are symmetric spaces or are dominated by symmetric spaces. A basic method to be employed is that of analyzing, describing and ultimately classifying the associated combinatorial chamber systems and buildings as in the case of positive curvature. In the nonnegative curvature case, however, the  buildings of interest are affine and hence in a sense infinite dimensional objects, and some of the key links described above for spherical buildings are not yet established for such Bruhat-Tits buildings. The prospects for establishing the missing links may bring new insights not only to affine (topological) buildings, but also to Kac-Moody groups and infinite dimensional symmetric spaces and representations."
