The variational <br/>techniques involve the study of  constrained variational  problems <br/>for lagrangian cycles. These problems can be formulated in arbitrary <br/>Kaehler (or symplectic) manifolds and involve minimizing volume among <br/>lagrangians that represent a fixed homology class and proving optimal <br/>regularity of the minimizer. In particular the project hopes to show <br/>that if the ambient manifold is a Calabi-Yau $3$-fold then, for a <br/>suitably formulated problem, the minimizer is special lagrangian. It <br/>has long been known that the mean curvature flow of a lagrangian <br/>submanifold preserves the lagrangian condition if the ambient <br/>manifold is Kaehler-Einstein. The project intends to investigate the <br/>regularity properties of the mean curvature flow of a lagrangian <br/>submanifold of a Kaehler-Einstein manifold.  In  particular, it <br/>intends to investigate the conditions under which the flow does and <br/>does not develop singularities in finite time.<br/><br/><br/>Variational problems with geometric constraints and mean curvature <br/>flow in codimension greater than one are on the frontier of <br/>mathematical analysis. These problems are natural in geometry but <br/>they are also important in many different applied problems. In <br/>material science a ``model'' problem asks to find a minimizer of <br/>``kinetic energy'' among area preserving maps between disks and to <br/>find the optimal smoothness of the minimizer. At present, the <br/>existence of a minimizer is known but nothing is known about its <br/>singularities. Parts of this project are closely related to this kind <br/>of  ``regularity'' question. In string theory  well known work <br/>conjectures the existence of a certain class of volume minimizing <br/>three dimensional surfaces called special lagrangian submanifolds. <br/>This project is a direct attempt to answer this question in the <br/>affirmative.  Mean curvature flow in various codimensions models many <br/>different physical phenomena. This project  attempts to exploit  the <br/>``lagrangian'' constraint to get an understanding of mean curvature <br/>flow  in higher codimensions. This subject is relatively unexplored. <br/>The techniques investigated in this project hold the promise of <br/>enhancing the interaction between geometry and various fields of <br/>applied mathematics and engineering and in bringing new results and <br/>techniques into these fields.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The first<br/>set of problems concerns the dynamics of an elastic curve moving<br/>in three-dimensional space, under forces determined by its<br/>curvature and subject to the constraint that it is inextensible.<br/>The main question is whether solutions starting from sufficiently<br/>smooth initial data exist for all time, or whether they may<br/>become singular in finite time.  For the long-time evolution of<br/>an infinite curve, solitary waves are expected to play an<br/>important role.  The boundary value problem for the tension will<br/>be studied in detail, with the goal of obtaining sharp bounds for<br/>the tension in terms of the position and velocity of the curve.<br/>In the second set of problems, the PI proposes to settle a<br/>conjectured quantitative version of the classical rearrangement<br/>inequality for the Coulomb energy. Furthermore, the cases of<br/>equality in the Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger inequality for multiple<br/>integrals will be investigated.  In addition, the PI participates<br/>in two interdisciplinary collaborations, on Statistical Network<br/>Calculus and its applications to data traffic (with colleagues<br/>from Computer Science and Systems Engineering), and on the<br/>clustering of proteins on membranes within polarized cells (with<br/>colleagues from Biology).<br/><br/>The elastic curve equations described above provide a simple<br/>example of a class of nonlinear wave equations with geometric<br/>forces and geometric constraints. The analytic difficulties<br/>encountered in this problem, and the techniques used to overcome<br/>them, are expected to be relevant for more complex mechanical<br/>systems with geometric forces.  While the work is geometrically<br/>motivated, the dynamics of elastic wires are clearly relevant to<br/>structural questions in Mechanical Engineering.  The basic<br/>well-posedness questions addressed here could have implications<br/>for the convergence of numerical solution schemes.

A notable contribution of<br/>the applied collaborations is that they expose researchers in<br/>Biology and Engineering to the everyday use of simple, but<br/>rigorous Mathematics.  The Network Calculus results center on<br/>questions of admission control and service guarantees in large<br/>data networks.

The first area concerns the application of<br/>nonlinear gluing techniques to the Cauchy problem in General Relativity.<br/>Nonlinear gluing techniques have played a central role in geometric<br/>analysis over the last 20 years.  It is only recently that they have been<br/>introduced as a useful tool in General Relativity.  Applications have<br/>included the existence of asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes with<br/>arbitrary spacial topology and those with no maximal slices.  The PI will<br/>extend and apply these powerful tools in a number of important ways. The<br/>second set of projects studies the existence and behavior of smooth<br/>Schr\""odinger maps. From a geometric point of view the Schr\""odinger flow<br/>is the most natural dispersive equation as it arises as the Hamiltonian<br/>flow of the Dirichlet energy for maps between manifolds.  This work will<br/>establish a bridge between the well-developed theory of dispersive<br/>equations and important techniques from geometric analysis. The third area<br/>is a continuation of the PI's work on surfaces of constant mean curvature<br/>(CMC) in Euclidean 3-space.  The local structure of the moduli space of<br/>all such surfaces with a fixed topology was previously worked out by the<br/>PI and his co-authors.  The development and application of new gluing<br/>techniques for CMC surfaces has led to important advances in our ability<br/>to describe the global structure of these moduli spaces.  The PI will<br/>carry this work significantly forward so that we may begin to obtain a<br/>more thorough understanding of these basic geometric objects.<br/> <br/>General Relativity is the physical theory which forms the cornerstone to<br/>our understanding of the large scale structure of the Universe, and has<br/>been intimately intertwined with differential geometry and partial<br/>differential equations since its inception at the beginning of the 20th<br/>century. As with any physical theory, its dynamical formulation (the<br/>Cauchy problem) is of central concern. The PI's research on the Cauchy<br/>problem will develop and apply new analytic techniques to General<br/>Relativity. The resolution of these problems will bring us further in the<br/>long term goal of understanding how to model physical phenomena via the<br/>mathematics of the initial data sets. Analytically, the Schroedinger flow<br/>is a generalization of the classical nonlinear Schroedinger equation,<br/>which has been intensively studied. The proposed program concerning the<br/>Schroedinger flow will foster the development of a new area of geometric<br/>dispersive systems.  Surfaces of constant mean curvature arise naturally<br/>as the surfaces which locally minimize their surface area while<br/>maintaining a fixed enclosed volume.  Soap bubbles form a familiar and<br/>important class of examples of surfaces of constant mean curvature.  The<br/>significance of these research projects lies both in the importance of the<br/>particular results which the PI will obtain and also in the continual<br/>development of sophisticated techniques which enable one to approach and<br/>understand problems which exhibit increasingly complex phenomena. Much of<br/>this research is interdisciplinary both between distinct areas within<br/>Mathematics and between Mathematics and Physics.  While important results<br/>have already been obtained, there is great potential for expansion in<br/>these areas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The first one concerns the free boundary regularity problem below the continuous threshold. In the search of the right formulation for the two-phase free boundary regularity problem below the continuous threshold, the PI and C. Kenig made an important discovery. The common theme to most of the results in the literature concerning the regularity of the free boundary is that near a flat point the free boundary is regular. The PI and her co-author found a global criterion which guarantees the regularity of the free boundary but which does not involve flatness. Motivated by this, they are in the process of developing a new<br/>set of techniques to prove regularity of the free boundary in several different setups. The second question addressed in this proposal concerns the existence of smooth solutions for the Schroedinger flow. In the last couple of years several authors have focused their attention on the Schroedinger flow, which is the geometric equivalent of a dispersive PDE. The approach of the PI and co-authors establishes a bridge between the theory of dispersive equations and the traditional techniques in geometric analysis.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems arise naturally in physics and engineering. The free boundary may appear as the interface between a fluid and the air, or water and ice. In the filtration problem, which studies how water filtrates from a dam made of a porous medium (say earth), the free boundary separates the wet part from the dry part. Many authors have studied the central problem of characterizing the regularity of the free boundary. For the last 8 years the investigator and C. Kenig have undertaken a joint program whose main goal has been to fully understand the boundary regularity problem below the continuous threshold (in the example above this corresponds to the case when the speed of the water is not a continuous function). The success of this program has enhanced the idea that weak notions of regularity are suitable to study problems that so far had only been considered in terms of classical notions of regularity. <br/>The approach proposed to study free boundary regularity problems should have an everlasting impact. It offers an alternative to the standard techniques used in geometric analysis to prove that a set is ``smooth'' which require that it be flat, in some appropriate sense, which is well adapted to the given problem. The proposed program concerning the Schroedinger flow is a significant step forward in the development of the area of geometric dispersive systems. The success of this project will benefit both geometric analysis and the field of dispersive equations. Furthermore by virtue of being related to the Heisenberg model for a ferromagnetic spin system it might yield some insight into this physical problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Specific problems proposed are (1) Obtaining space-time Strichartz estimates for solutions of the linear wave and Schroedinger equations in presence of potentials with critical (i.e. inverse-square) decay at infinity and/or with local singularities.  (2) Proving stability of vortex-like wave maps from the Minkowski space into the sphere, utilizing the above estimates.

Electromagnetics, fluid and solid mechanics, weak and strong interactions of elementary particles, and Einstein's theory of gravitation are all describable in the framework of a field theory.  One of the most important physical phenomena to be understood in this framework is the  phenomenon of waves, their creation, propagation,  interaction, and dispersion.  Some examples are electromagnetic waves, material waves, and gravitational waves.  Each of the problems proposed here has a direct consequence in the understanding of a specific aspect of the wave phenomenon.  With the dawn of a new century, as advances in technology force scientists to address the inherently nonlinear behavior of nature in more detail than ever before, mathematical analysts are in a position to take up the challenge of doing research in those areas of physical mathematics that have long been neglected by others.  This fundamental research involves going beyond numerical simulations and approximate equations, and addressing the hard problems that lie at the core of the subject, i.e. in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.   Understanding nonlinear waves is an important step in this direction. This is very much a collaborative effort, and in particular collaborations with members of mathematical communities in <br/>other parts of the world where a tradition of caring about physical problems is well-maintained, provides us with an opportunity to play a role in preventing the erosion of the leading status of the US in these key areas of mathematical sciences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

(A famous question on this theme is<br/>``can you hear the shape of a drum?"".) This leads  to the study of<br/> spectral invariants of  geometric operators, which<br/>are   geometric invariants of the manifold. The<br/>zeta invariants of geometric elliptic operators form a family of<br/>such spectral invariants which includes in particular the<br/>determinant of the Laplacian and certain integrated local<br/>invariants such as the Yamabe functional.<br/> It is well known that among metrics of a given<br/>volume and conformal class, the Yamabe functional is extremized at<br/>a metric of constant scalar curvature, and the same is true for<br/>the determinant of the Laplacian on surfaces.  This raises many<br/>questions regarding  how the determinant of the Laplacian behaves<br/>in higher dimensions, what happens for different types of<br/>Laplacian, and how  other zeta invariants behave. There has<br/>already been progress on several of  these questions, the<br/>motivation being both to understand the behavior of specific zeta<br/>invariants and to investigate possible applications of zeta<br/>invariants  to geometry. Okikiolu proposes to study a number of<br/>issues related to the existence, uniqueness and behavior of<br/>critical metrics for the determinant of the Laplacian and  other<br/>zeta invariants, including questions concerning global upper or<br/>lower bounds, gradient flow, behavior across conformal classes,<br/>behavior of model problems, and development of the basic analytic<br/>theory of zeta invariants. In addition, Okikiolu proposes to work<br/>on  related questions concerning  spectral invariants of Toeplitz<br/>operators on manifolds, and in a somewhat different  direction, on<br/>the problem of extending the Verlinde formulas from quantum field<br/>theory.<br/><br/> Understanding the relationship between the<br/>geometry of a space and the spectra of natural geometric<br/>differential operators on the space is a problem which arises in a<br/>number of branches of science. Individual eigenvalues are hard to<br/>analyze and often the geometry of a space is more clearly<br/>reflected by certain weighted averages of the eigenvalues such as<br/>zeta invariants. In particular, determinants of Laplacians on<br/>manifolds have been studied and applied in several fields of<br/>mathematics and physics including topology, quantum field theory,<br/>string theory, algebraic geometry, and conformal geometry.  The<br/>research proposed here should lead to a more complete mathematical<br/>theory of zeta invariants for geometrical and physical<br/>applications.<br/><br/><br/>"

It is an interesting questions in itself, but it also can give rise to unitary representations of the infinite-dimensional groups.

The first <br/>proposed project is building a model to simulate ``tree shaped'' objects <br/>in nature, and apply it to optimal mass transportation problems. The <br/>problems proposed here include building a transport theory of <br/>rectifiable varifolds, finding connections of this model with other <br/>problems, and extending this theory to more general spaces. The second <br/>project concerns minimal surfaces that live in singular spaces such as <br/>singular complex projective varieties under their intersection homology <br/>groups. In his thesis, the PI gave a rectifiable currents' version of <br/>intersection homology theory on stratified subanalytic pseudomanifolds. <br/>He showed that there exists a modified mass minimizer (which is a <br/>rectifiable current) in every intersection homology class. The <br/>associated mass minimizers turn out to be almost minimal currents. The <br/>mass minimizers the PI considered may intersect (in a controlled <br/>fashion) the singular locus of the singular space. In this proposal, the <br/>PI will continue his investigation on regularity properties of the <br/>associated mass minimizers, and possible link with Hodge theory. One of <br/>the main methods used in both projects is geometric measure theory.<br/>   <br/>The phenomenon of ``tree shaped'' path is very common in nature. Trees, <br/>railways, airlines, lightning, the circulatory system, and neural <br/>networks are common examples. The research of optimal ``tree shaped'' <br/>path not only expands the research area of mass transportation, but also <br/>of both theoretical and applied interest. Biologists are currently <br/>looking for a model to give a fundamental explanation for biological <br/>scaling laws which are mathematical expressions of how organisms' <br/>biology varies with their size. The model proposed in this research <br/>might be the desired one. As Monge's mass transport problem is strongly <br/>linked with many areas of mathematics, especially with partial <br/>differential equations, it is also possible that this new approach of <br/>mass transportation will find its applications in economics, biology, <br/>image processing and some other subjects. Soap films are physical model <br/>for minimal surfaces. These surfaces play an important role as a tool in <br/>the study of  topology, geometry and physics. The research of the second <br/>project concerns global properties of soap films that live in more <br/>general singular spaces and possible links to Hodge theory and optimal <br/>mass transportation.

This involves <br/>studying the global topology, geometry, and singular theoretic structure of<br/>light caustic surfaces in a spacetime.  Program 2 points to new mathematical<br/>issues relating the geometry of light caustic surfaces to topological<br/>invariants of the matter singularities of gravitational lenses.

This work would open up new mathematical directions that bridge the<br/>geometric aspects of singularity theory with several areas in probability<br/>theory (Rayleigh-Levy statistics, zeros of random polynomials, etc.).   The<br/>second part of the proposal focuses on one of the fundamental predictions of<br/>Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, namely,the existence of black holes.<br/> Though a black hole cannot be seen directly, its extremely strong<br/>gravitational field warps the spacetime about the black hole causing light<br/>rays that managed to get through the region to be bent with impressively large<br/>angles (e.g., rays can loop around a black hole numerous times before arriving<br/>at the observer).  The probing of such extremes of gravity would be a critical<br/>test of our understanding of the nature of space and time.   The proposal<br/>explores mathematically the lensing signatures of the strong gravitational<br/>field due to the massive black hole generally believed to be at the center of<br/>our galaxy.  This should draw upon techniques from differential geometry and<br/>singularity theory, and create synergies between these mathematical<br/>topics and the physics of black holes.<br/>"

The proposers are dedicated researchers and educators,<br/>and Boston College and Wesleyan University both have strong dual<br/>identities as teaching and research institutions. An innovative<br/>component of the proposal is to use its multi disciplinary nature<br/>to introduce motivated undergraduates to areas of mathematics<br/>that are currently not well represented (e.g. geometry and<br/>analysis) in the undergraduate degree programs at the proposers'<br/>respective institutions.

In the quantum mechanical description of a<br/>particle in a potential, one distinguishes between ordinary bound<br/>states and scattering states whose wave functions are nonnormalizable<br/>and whose energies can assume a continuum of possible values.  Inverse<br/>scattering theory seeks to understand as much as possible about the<br/>nature of a potential from the scattering behavior exhibited by<br/>particles interacting with the potential.  The investigators will<br/>address this problem by constructing and studying potentials with the<br/>same scattering resonances.  The investigations in sub-Riemannian<br/>geometry are motivated by a wealth of physical phenomena including<br/>problems in wheeled robotic control, satellite navigation and<br/>stabilization and thermodynamics.  At this point in time, relatively<br/>little is known about the general theory guiding these types of<br/>control phenomena.

This project focuses on a technology transfer from contemporary ideas in topology, geometry, and dynamics to bear upon application domains which include the following: First, Robotics: tools from configuration space theory, CAT(0)complexes, and computational topology will be directed toward specific problems in reconfigurable robotics, sensor-based navigation of mobile agents, and self-assembly systems. Second, Parabolic coupled systems: a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids will be used to solve parabolic variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian mechanics, and coupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid index will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. Third, Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology will be directed toward solving global problems of the dynamics and stability of Eulerian fluid flows in dimensions higher than two.<br/>In most systems of interest in science and engineering, multiple cooperative tasks must be globally coordinated. A common thread is that whether the tasks involve macro-scale robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, or fluid particles, there is an abstract space of configurations lurking behind the physical phenomena. Unearthing and examining those properties of physically-motivated configuration spaces which capture the global features, the topology, geometry, and dynamics, holds the promise of providing global tools which transcend the physical instantiation of the system at hand: ostensibly different systems possess similar topological underpinnings. The research component of this project is the development of contemporary topological and global-geometric techniques for analyzing the dynamics and coordination of systems of interest in engineering and computer science. The overall goal is an effective technology transfer from cutting-edge perspectives in topology to bear upon systems in application domains, which include robotics, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. This is combined with a blend of pedagogical service across graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, featuring a focused research group on topological robotics and a high-school outreach program of expository lectures on the relevance and joy of mathematical research.<br/><br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

These projects are the problem of existence of periodic<br/>orbits for Hamiltonian dynamical systems and the study of<br/>topological properties of certain Poisson manifolds. The first<br/>problem Viktor Ginzburg addresses in this proposal is the<br/>investigation of the size of the set of regular energy values on<br/>which a Hamiltonian system does not have periodic orbits. By the<br/>almost existence theorem, this set must be of zero measure and<br/>from counterexamples to the Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture it is<br/>known that this set may be non-empty. Thus the question is to<br/>bridge the gap between these two results.  Another series of<br/>problems discussed in the proposal concerns the existence of<br/>periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems of a special nature,<br/>including those describing the motion of a charge in a (strong)<br/>magnetic field or, more generally, the existence of periodic<br/>orbits near Morse-Bott non-degenerate symplectic extrema. These<br/>problems are closely related to the investigation of the<br/>(relative) Hofer-Zehnder capacity function and the Floer homology<br/>of certain Hamiltonians. The objective of the proposed research<br/>in the area of Poisson topology is to study connections between<br/>the geometry of Poisson structures and topology of underlying<br/>manifolds.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of physical<br/>processes in which dissipative forces can be neglected. For<br/>example, planetary motion in celestial mechanics and some<br/>electro- or magneto-dynamical processes can be, and usually are,<br/>treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the classical<br/>subjects in the theory of dynamical systems is the study of<br/>periodic orbits (i.e. cyclic motions). Periodic motion is the<br/>simplest and most common type of motion after equilibrium.  It is<br/>believed that a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems have<br/>periodic orbits and systems without such orbits have only been<br/>recently discovered. Yet, in all but simplest problems, finding<br/>periodic orbits requires the use of advanced and powerful<br/>mathematical methods.  The investigation of periodic orbits lies<br/>at the very core of the modern theory of Hamiltonian dynamical<br/>systems.

This class of systems includes those<br/>describing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field and the<br/>proposed research has potential applications to physics and<br/>mathematical aspects of mechanics.

VARIATIONAL AND TOPOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO   THE THREE-BODY<br/>PROBLEM.<br/><br/><br/>The proposer will investigate several aspects<br/>of the Newtonian three-body problems using<br/>techniques from geometric analysis and<br/> classical ODEs. <br/>The main new direction proposed is <br/>to understand scattering in the<br/>Newtonian three-body problem using the technique of ``gluing'' borrowed<br/>from geometric PDE.  An unbounded solution with negative energy<br/> consist of two ``bound masses'' orbiting each other<br/>in a nearly Keplerian orbit while the third mass<br/>sails away, asymptoting to  a Keplerian<br/>hypebolic orbit. Each of the  two Jacobi vectors <br/> asymptotes to a solution   to  a   Kepler<br/>two-body problems -- an elliptic one for the   bound pair,<br/>and a hyperbolic one for the vector joining the  <br/> receding mass to the center of mass of the bound pair.<br/>If the solution is unbounded in  both the past and future,<br/>there can, and typically will,  be different Keplerian orbits in the past<br/>and<br/>the future -- indeed the pair which is bound in the distant past<br/>might be different from the pair bound in the future. <br/>Which Kepler parameters can be connected to which by <br/>an unbounded three-body orbit? This scattering problem is one of <br/>the central questions we will investigate.  <br/> Other problems to be investigated<br/>follow past lines of investigation initiated by the proposer.<br/>We give two examples. Planar three body solutions can be partially encoded<br/>by<br/>their syzygy sequence. Is every syzygy sequence possible?<br/>Initial computer investigations suggest not.   <br/>Is it true that every zero-angular momentum negative energy<br/>solution which tends to the Lagrange homothety orbit<br/>either is the Lagrange homothety orbit, or suffers a syzygy? <br/> <br/>The Newtonian <br/>three-body problem concerns the dynamics of<br/>three bodies,    <br/>modelled as  point masses, attracting each other by Newton's<br/>$1/r^2$ gravitational force.  Think of the bodies<br/>as the earth, moon, and sun, or as three stars.  <br/>The ``problem'' is not a single problem,<br/>but rather  a large  collection<br/>of problems concering the         <br/>long-term qualitative behavior of such a system of masses.  <br/>A solution is called ``bounded'' if the three interbody distances<br/>remain finite and bounded by some fixed distance for all time.  <br/>  A central open question is: how<br/>big is the set of bounded solutions? <br/>Is it true that arbitrarily close to a bound solution there is an<br/>unbounded one? <br/>The traditional approach to this question has involved ``Arnol'd<br/>diffusion''<br/>-- a mechanism discovered by V.I. Arnol'd through which seemingly stable<br/>regions and orbits become unstable and perhaps eventually unbounded.<br/>The  Arnol'd diffusion method or mechanism is in essence perturbative: one<br/>tries to perturb away from an apparently stable situation.<br/>As an alternative, we propose to start at infinity and sweep in from<br/>infinity to see what parts of phase space are swept out.  <br/>``Starting at infinity'' means thinking of the scattering problem --<br/>the situation of one body infinitely distant from the other two.<br/>The most interesting case is that in which  two of the masses remain <br/>bounded, orbiting each other in a nearly Keplerian orbit as the third mass<br/>recedes.<br/>Imagine beginning in such a manner in the infinite past, and ending up in<br/>such a manner in the infinite future, <br/>but with the past and future bound pairs perhaps different,<br/>or their  Keplerian ellipse having   different eccentricities,<br/> energies, etc.  In this way we get a kind of ``scattering map'' from<br/>Kepler orbits<br/>(or parameters) to Kepler orbits. <br/>What does this scattering map look like?  This ``scattering problem''<br/>is one of the main new directions we propose to investigate.<br/>In addition, we propose several questions more  in line with<br/>our past investigations.  Here is one example.  A ``syzygy'' is an instant<br/>at which all three masses lie on a  line.   <br/>At such an instant one   mass  ``eclipses'' (lies between) the other two.<br/>Label the syzygies   by the mass doing the eclipsing.<br/>List the labelled  syzygies in order of appearance, thus  associating to<br/>each solution<br/>a syzygy sequence.  <br/>In the planar three-body problem, are all syzygy  sequences possible?<br/>This is an open problem.  The proposer has made partial progress.  Initial<br/>computer investigations with<br/>the help of an undergraduate researcher  suggest that the answer might be<br/>``no''.<br/><br/>"

The existence of tori for each value of this<br/>invariant will then be investigated and the characterization used<br/>to produce examples.  Cones over these tori are associative in<br/>the imaginary octonions, which provides additional geometrical<br/>motivation for their study.  The second project concerns the<br/>energy of minimal tori in the 3-sphere.

It is<br/>precisely the low-genus cases upon which we shall focus, using<br/>spectral curve techniques.  The final project concerns the<br/>possible singularities of special Lagrangian 3-folds, a topic of<br/>considerable current interest due to its role in mirror symmetry.<br/>Specifically, cones over tori will be studied and the question of<br/>whether the links may be real-algebraic will be addressed.<br/><br/>Energy is a fundamental quantity; physical systems seek to<br/>minimize energy or at least to find (possibly unstable) critical<br/>points of it.  One typically studies critical points of energy,<br/>for example minimal submanifolds, which appear in all of the<br/>above proposed projects.  These have a long and distinguished<br/>history in both mathematics and physics, and remain subject to<br/>much attention.  Absolute energy minimizers are rare and<br/>difficult to locate.  However one source of them is calibrated<br/>submanifolds, of which both associative and special Lagrangian<br/>submanifolds are examples.  Special Lagrangian submanifolds have<br/>other interesting applications to physics.  In super-symmetric<br/>string theory, the universe is modeled as a ten-dimensional<br/>object, consisting locally of the familiar four-dimensional<br/>space-time, and a six-dimensional space (a Calabi-Yau manifold)<br/>that is compact, and hence sufficiently 'small' that one does not<br/>observe it in everyday life.

If an observer  sits at a regular point<br/>and looks around, the `horizon'  he/she observes    is round, spherical.   The<br/>`horizon '  of  a singular point is  an object mathematicians refer<br/>to as `the link of the singularity'   and is  shaped quite differently<br/>than the `horizon' of a regular point.   In fact,  the shape of  this link<br/>alone  contains a wealth of information about how the space in the<br/>vicinity  of the singular point  twists, bends and folds.   This kind of<br/>information   is carried in abundance by      certain objects the<br/>physicists refer to as `monopoles'.

The investigator  will analyze the<br/>structure of these monopoles by   `looking  at these singularities<br/>through a  high resolution microscope', a process mathematically know as<br/>adiabatic  deformation of the space.

Singularities in liquid crystal materials will be also<br/>studied in several contexts.  The theories of improper<br/>intersections of polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry<br/>will be investigated to understand related behavior in analysis<br/>and partial differential equations.  Combined  transport systems<br/>such as occurs in postal routes, the circulatory system, and<br/>plant root systems can be described variationally with recently<br/>discovered geometric structures.<br/><br/>Underlying many physical phenomena is a least energy principle<br/>whereby certain configurations or fields or geometric shape are<br/>distinguished by their property of having less energy or area than<br/>competing objects.  The external constraints often lead to<br/>singularities, which are characterized by rapid changes of<br/>structure occurring in very small spatial regions.  For example,<br/>one observes dislocation faults in solids under stress, domain<br/>walls in magnetized materials, liquid edges and corners in soap<br/>films, and point, curve, and surface defects in various liquid<br/>crystal materials.  We deal with new mathematical structures and<br/>theories necessary to explain and predict such phenomena.  In<br/>these problems, the theoretical studies of pure mathematics, the<br/>numerical computational studies of applied mathematics, and the<br/>phenomenological studies from observation and experiment all<br/>benefit each other and all have a crucial scientific role. The<br/>present proposed research has many problems motivated by and<br/>applicable to science and engineering. The new geometric<br/>variational tools are not presently well-known in the broader<br/>scientific community, and communication of these mathematical<br/>topics and techniques will be very useful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The first topic of the investigator's research is<br/>the uniformization problem for Kahler manifolds. More precisely,<br/>the study is of the geometric properties of the algebra of<br/>holomorphic functions on the universal cover of a Kahler<br/>manifold. There is a conjecture of Shafarevich formulated in the<br/>early 1970's stating that the universal cover of a compact Kahler<br/>manifold is holomorphic convex. This conjecture proposes that the<br/>function theory of noncompact universal covers of compact Kahler<br/>manifolds is very rich. The difficulty in proving the conjecture<br/>is that there is a lack of methods to produce holomorphic<br/>functions on universal covers.

The classical theory of harmonic maps deals with<br/>maps between Riemannian manifolds.  More recently, the importance of<br/>considering singular domains and targets has been discovered.  Harmonic map<br/>theory in singular spaces was initiated by Gromov and Schoen and their<br/>analysis of harmonic maps into non-positively curved Riemannian simplicial<br/>complexes combined with Corlette's vanishing theorem is the basis of their<br/>proof of p-adic super-rigidity.  The study of harmonic maps into singular<br/>targets was further generalized by Korevaar and Schoen and independently by<br/>Jost.  Further generalization is to consider singular domains.  In this<br/>project, we study harmonic maps from a simplicial polyhedron to a metric<br/>space of non-positive curvature.  A fundamental question is the regularity<br/>of these maps, and our goal is to show that these maps are smooth enough to<br/>be useful in many applications.  In particular, we hope to bring harmonic<br/>map theory and holomorphic quadratic differentials into the study of<br/>finitely generated groups.  More precisely, we will use harmonic maps from a<br/>two-dimensional simplicial complex to understand finitely generated groups<br/>from their actions on R-trees.   This point of view is important in the<br/>study of combinatorial group theory and three-dimensional topology.<br/>Harmonic maps will also be used to investigate compactifications of the<br/>Teichmuller space of a compact surface.  Finally, the study of minimal<br/>surfaces will be considered as an extension of the generalized harmonic map<br/>theory.  <br/>The proposed work contributes to the basic understanding of geometric<br/>variational problems.  Mathematicians have devoted large effort in<br/>developing variational methods and the successes of these investigations<br/>have laid the foundations of many branches of sience. There is a natural<br/>notion of energy associated to maps between certain spaces and, in this<br/>project, we study its critical points which are called harmonic maps. They<br/>have shown to be extremely useful as an analytic tool in geometry.  The<br/>generalization of harmonic maps between smooth spaces to non-smooth spaces<br/>promises to yield many more applications. We investigate the extent to which<br/>the classical methods in harmonic maps can be carried over to the singular<br/>setting.  The applications of the generalized theory make these questions<br/>relevant to a broad mathematical community.<br/>"

This generic framework is a very natural approach to many<br/>important questions of differential geometry. Some typical cases are those<br/>of contact structures fillable by symplectic forms, complex geometry and<br/>Cauchy-Riemann boundary, Einstein geometry and conformal infinity. It is<br/>interesting to study how deformation theory of the boundary induces<br/>deformations of a filling. This problem is often related to some positive<br/>frequency condition, which is of particular interest for physicists. This<br/>will be used to study singular Yang-Mills connections of (a conjectural)<br/>Donaldson theory on Calabi-Yau 3-manifolds. More generally, we look at the<br/>picture of a moduli space on the manifold which projects on a<br/>corresponding moduli space defined on the boundary. Whenever it can be<br/>shown that the projection has a finite nonzero degree in some sense, we<br/>obtain a powerfull tool to prove the existence of fillings. Another way to<br/>tackle the questions of existence is to develop gluing theorems between<br/>moduli spaces. Some applications of gluing for Seiberg-Witten equations<br/>are already being developped thus giving new perspectives on contact<br/>geometry.<br/><br/><br/>A physical theory is defined by a configuration space, together with<br/>objects (for example a metric) verifying particular equations.<br/>The state of a physical system is constrained  by its configuration on<br/>the  boundary of the space, or, at infinity. Therefore, it is a<br/>natural question to ask wether a theory is rich or empty: is it<br/>possible to find a physical system with a given behavior on the<br/>boundary, and if so, do we have many solutions? In other words is the<br/>system soft or rigid? Beyond the physical flavor, this approach, known<br/>as a field theory, has deep implications in mathematics. First, it is<br/>required to elaborate original tools in analysis, called moduli space<br/>theories,  that have their own beauty. Secondly, the method relates<br/>very different problems. To illustrate that, we mention the following<br/>situation: we consider a 3-dimensional space (it could be the<br/>3-dimensional sphere) bounding a 4-dimensional space (like the ball<br/>inside the sphere). Then, we look at knots on the boundary (they could<br/>be  strands of DNA). These knots can be thought of as the boundary of<br/>a surface lying into the 4-dimensional space. Then, it can be shown<br/>that there is a subtle relation between the knot theory in dimension 3<br/>and the theory of surfaces lying in a 4-dimensional space.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Specifically, the conference will emphasize two areas where there have been significant advances in recent years, namely 1) geometry and physics, and 2) representation theory. The discussion of advances in geometry and physics will focus on new ideas coming from quantum field theory and string theory, and their geometric consequences. This discussion will involve diverse topics, such as mirror symmetry, Seiberg-Witten theory, twisted K-theory, chiral algebras, noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, formality theory, intersection theory on moduli spaces, etc. The discussion of advances in representation theory will focus on the interactions between representation theory and geometry; these interactions have recently led to the development of powerful new methods of studying representations. Some of the methods are the geometric Langlands program, quiver varieties, geometric realizations of quantum groups and their representations. <br/><br/>The conference ``Unity of Mathematics'' is designed to bring together a diverse group of leading senior mathematicians and young researchers for a discussion of the most important recent developments in mathematics, with the focus on the topics ""geometry and physics"", and ""representation theory"". The first topic involves developments in geometry that were triggered by recent breakthroughs in quantum field theory (which describes the motion of elementary particles) and string theory (which attempts to unify quantum field theory and Einstein's general relativity). Although string theory has not yet made successful experimental predictions, it is striking that it did make successful predictions in geometry. These predictions are the first example in the history of science when geometry served as a ``lab'' for theoretical physics, and provide as much evidence that string theory is ``correct'' as an experimental verification would be. The second topic involves developments in representation theory (a branch of algebra that could be very roughly defined as  spectroscopy of symmetry), which have resulted from systematic use of deep ideas from geometry and topology (theory of shape). The conference will attract numerous mathematicians working in different fields, as well as many theoretical physicists. Young researchers are expected to find the conference especially useful because it will discuss developments occurring at boundaries between fields. This may well be an epiphany to those trained in a narrow specialty. The meeting will be a unique occasion; prominent mathematicians will not only review recent advances but will discuss their broad implications for mathematics. Special provisions will be made to encourage young researchers, graduate students, women and minorities to participate. <br/>"

Analytically<br/>speaking, this is the study of the initial value problem for<br/>appropriate Einstein-matter systems for asymptotically flat initial<br/>data. The central questions in the subject are the celebrated weak and<br/>strong cosmic censorship conjectures of Penrose. In previous work,<br/>the author was able to resolve the issue of strong cosmic censorship in<br/>the setting of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell scalar field<br/>system, confirming a heuristic picture that had been the subject of debate<br/>in the physics community. The present proposal concerns the development<br/>of a complete theory for gravitational collapse in spherical symmetry,<br/>which at the same time takes into account the physics of angular momentum.<br/>In view of the constraint of spherical symmetry, angular momentum is<br/>simulated through charge. Mathematically, a rigorous formulation is given<br/>by the initial value problem in the large for a charged self-gravitating scalar<br/>field, i.e. for the Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar field system. The<br/>study can be divided roughly into three analytically distinct families<br/>of problems: the study of the formation of trapped surfaces,<br/>the study of the decay of fields on the event horizon, and the study of<br/>the instability of the Cauchy horizon.<br/>All problems require methods which go well beyond standard techniques of<br/>the theory of quasilinear hyperbolic p.d.e.'s in two dimensions.<br/>In particular, the interaction between geometric features characteristic<br/>of black holes with non-linear wave equations will certainly play a big<br/>role. Understanding these issues in the spherically symmetric case will<br/>hopefully point to the correct framework where these issues can eventually<br/>be studied in the absense of symmetry.<br/><br/>The collapse of a star under the force of its own gravity and<br/>the possible subsequent formation of a black hole is one of the<br/>most exciting predictions of the general theory of relativity. This<br/>process, however, is not well understood. Most of our current<br/>intuition derives from so-called ``explicit solutions'' of the<br/>Einstein equations, the governing equations of the theory.<br/>These ``explicit'' solutions, however, in addition to exhibiting<br/>behavior which is hoped to be physically relevant, exhibit also<br/>behavior widely considered to be pathological. For example, the Kerr<br/>solution, on which our intuition for the final state of gravitational<br/>collapse is largely based, contains so-called ``closed timelike curves''.<br/>These allow observers who enter the black hole to subsequently travel in time.<br/>Is this an unhappy accident of the very special nature of this<br/>solution, or is this a general property of black holes? In view<br/>of the strong non-linearity of the Einstein equations, and the difficulty<br/>of making accurate predictions on the basis of numerical or heuristic<br/>work, this seems to be an area where the techniques of rigorous<br/>mathematical analysis can make a tremendous impact.<br/>In this project, it is proposed to undertake a rigorous mathematical<br/>study of a realistic model of gravitational collapse, in particular one<br/>which takes account of angular momentum, the mechanism that leads to the<br/>failure of ``causality'' in the Kerr solution.

While most of these problems have by now been settled in the classical Euclidean or Riemannian settings, their sub-Riemannian counterparts presently form a body of fundamental open questions. One of the broader objectives of this proposal is to study some of them. This PI is concerned with developing a new theory of minimal surfaces, or more in general surfaces with bounded mean curvature, in sub-Riemannian spaces, study their regularity and classify the isoperimetric sets in some model spaces with symmetries. He proposes a calculus on hypersurfaces which hinges on the idea of horizontal Gauss map, and leads to a new notion of mean curvature The analysis of the ensuing nonlinear equations and systems constitutes a challenging new avenue of study. Within such calculus, minimal surfaces are thus hypersurfaces of zero mean curvature, and a problem of fundamental interest is a sub-Riemannian version of the famous conjecture of Bernstein. The latter displays a marked discrepancy with its classical ancestor and there is a host of new geometric phenomena connected with the singularities of the Gauss map which generically occur at those points where the subbundle which generates the sub-Riemannian structure becomes part of the tangent space to the hypersurface. Given the role of the classical Bernstein problem in the development of last century's mathematics, it is foreseeable that the theory of sub-Riemannian minimal surfaces and the corresponding Bernstein problem will sparkle a broad development. The PI also proposes to find the minimizers in the Folland-Stein embedding for groups of Heisenberg type and Siegel domain of type 2, and thereby compute the best constants. This program is instrumental to attacking the compact CR Yamabe problem for CR manifolds of higher codimension. In connection with the CR Yamabe problem the PI proposes to investigate a CR version of the positive mass theorem from relativity due to Schoen and Yau. It is expected that the theory of minimal surfaces previously mentioned will play an important role. Another emerging theory in sub-Riemannian geometry is that of equations of Monge-Amp\`ere type, which occupy a central position in geometry as well as in the calculus of variations in view of their tight connection with the problem of mass transport. The PI proposes to investigate a new estimate connected with a sub-Riemannian version of the geometric maximum principle of Alexandrov, Bakelman, and Pucci. In joint work he has recently obtained results for the appropriate class of ``convex"" functions, and, inspired by N.Krylov's approach, established monotonicity type results for a functional involving the symmetrized horizontal Hessian along with some appropriate commutators. Another problem included in this proposal is the optimal regularity for nonlinear equations arising in the study of quasiregular mappings between Carnot groups. This is presently a fundamental open question and, without its solution, it will be impossible to make substantial advances in nonlinear potential theory for sub-Riemannian spaces. In this connection the PI also plans to analyze the delicate question of the uniqueness of the fundamental solution and Green function, and study the geometric properties of their level sets. Other directions of investigation are the analysis of boundary value problems (Dirichlet, Neumann) for subelliptic equations and their associated heat flows, the study of free boundary problems, and the analysis of global properties of solutions to some pde's arising in geometry and mathematical physics. <br/>Partial differential equations and systems formed by the latter are the basic laws, which describe most natural phenomena. An understanding of the physical world also requires grasping the underlying geometric structure of the latter in its various forms. The present proposal belongs to the mainstream of research, which sits at the confluence of the theory of partial differential equations and systems, mostly of nonlinear type, and their connections with an emerging type of geometry, called sub-Riemannian geometry. Both theories have witnessed an explosion of interest in the last decade and they continue to attract the interest of various schools of mathematicians both nationwide and abroad. This proposal is also concerned with problems from mathematical physics and geometry in which symmetry plays an important role. Symmetry is present everywhere in nature, a remarkable instance being the fundamental laws of gravitation and electrostatic attraction. The study of conditions under which a natural phenomenon develops symmetries is important both for practical consequences and for its implications in the furthering of our knowledge. <br/><br/>"

By investigating  Legendrian knots in these <br/>dimensions the nature of contactstructures should be illuminated, just<br/>as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact<br/>structures. The final part of the proposed research centers on the <br/>connection between contact structures and hydrodynamics discovered a few<br/>years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist.

This renaissance is due to the recent<br/>remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and<br/>beautiful theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of<br/>all this recent work is the intimate connections between contact<br/>structures and topology in dimension three.

The Principal Investigator will<br/>also engage in several educational endeavors, including the support and<br/>encouragement of graduates students and the creation of introductory<br/>and survey materials to bring the rapidly developing field of contact<br/>geometry to a wider audience.<br/><br/><br/>"

One of the most <br/>important examples of a Hamiltonian T-space is the coadjoint orbit of a <br/>compact Lie group. Coadjoint orbits arise in physics, as they are the <br/>set of all matrices with specified spectra. They also occur in <br/>representation theory, as all irreducible representations of a complex <br/>reductive Lie group occur as holomorphic sections of a line bundle over <br/>a coadjoint orbit. They occur in algebraic geometry as projective <br/>varieties. The intersection theory of naturally arising subvarieties, <br/>called Schubert varieties, appears in questions of linear algebra, <br/>valuation rings, and representation theory. Schubert calculus is <br/>important as it is the linear case for (and hence the first step <br/>towards) understanding complex algebraic intersections more generally. <br/>Algebraically, Schubert calculus analyses the multiplicative structure <br/>of the cohomology of flag varieties. The main open question is to find a <br/>totally positive formula for the (equivariant) structure constants. In <br/>joint work with A. Knutson, Goldin has discovered new techniques that <br/>give hope for a positive formula in certain cases. Goldin is also <br/>interested in topological invariants that distinguish reduced spaces for <br/>any compact Hamiltonian T-space, such as certain ideals found in its <br/>equivariant cohomology ring or generalized equivariant Euler classes. <br/>Goldin is additionally developing techniques to calculate integrals on <br/>certain symplectic reduced spaces using small amounts of information <br/>about how the torus acts on the original symplectic manifold.<br/><br/>Understanding Schubert calculus is a small step towards the larger <br/>question of how to study intersections of algebraic varieties. Such <br/>intersections arise outside of mathematics, as scientists ask questions <br/>that involve the concurrence of several physical constraints, and want <br/>to understand what possible solutions there may be. Symplectic geometry <br/>is a natural setting to describe physical systems. The space of the <br/>position and the momentum of a particle, for example, is called ""phase <br/>space"" and has a natural symplectic structure on it. In many cases, <br/>there is a lot of symmetry; physical observations of the Hydrogen atom, <br/>for example, are unaffected by the position of the observer a fixed <br/>distance away from the particle. The study of ""reduced spaces"" is a way <br/>of studying the physics while simplifying the space by ignoring (in <br/>fact, dividing out) these symmetries. Much of Goldin's work involves <br/>techniques to do computations on these simplified systems, which may <br/>shed light on questions that physicists and chemists are posing about <br/>molecules and particles. Goldin is also writing a book (joint with G. <br/>Goldin) on myths in mathematics education.<br/><br/>"
