Fisher<br/><br/>In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is often played by the symmetries of the object - particularly when the object has many symmetries. The proposed research projects investigate ways of characterizing, describing and studying spaces with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These questions often require learning, adapting and applying ideas and techniques from many areas of mathematics. This work has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations (the use of wavefront sets to study fine analytic properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical computer science (expander graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding problems).<br/><br/>The main thrust of the proposed research is to introduce and develop new analytic techniques in group theory and the study of group actions. Major projects include: (a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work with Eskin and Whyte) and newer ideas involving non-standard analysis and Loeb measures; (b) developing techniques for studying rigidity of dynamical systems based on analytic techniques from partial differential equations, particularly the theory of wavefront sets; (c) classifying hyperbolic groups which act smoothly on their boundaries using ideas from both dynamics and geometric group theory; (d) developing new cohomological methods in the study of rigidity of group actions. All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of rigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. Many proposed projects involve applying analytic ideas and techniques to problems traditionally studied by dynamical, geometric or topological methods."

While the familiar geometry of Euclidean spaces takes length and angle as fundamental notions, the structure of symplectic geometry begins from the measurement of two-dimensional area.  Much of the modern study of symplectic geometry is devoted to understanding distinguished structures on symplectic manifolds, a study that can reveal useful invariants for those manifolds.  The research to be pursued in this project is focused on questions in this area arising out of string theory.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on developing the theory of microlocal categories, such as the full sub-category of objects supported on a Lagrangian submanifold, and on developing an appropriate ground category for the microlocal category, which may be topological in origin.  The project also aims to find a description of the microlocal categories associated to flag varieties.  Further investigations are motivated by ideas of quantization, which is here understood in geometric terms abstracted from concepts in physics."

Also as intrinsic geometric objects of the underlying space, minimal surfaces can be viewed as non-linear analog of the eigenstates in Quantum Mechanics.  The mathematical problem that amounts to showing that every bounding wire is spanned by at least one soap film has been studied in detail for many years and admits many important generalizations.  Most of the previous techniques for proving such existence properties focused on the ""minimizing theory"", which corresponds to finding the ground state in Quantum Mechanics.  One natural but very difficult technique, called the ""min-max theory"", corresponding to finding the excited states in Quantum Mechanics (i.e. the eigenstates with energy higher than the ground state), has had striking recent successes, and will be one of the major objects of study in this research program.  Another project will study geometric inequalities in general relativity, particularly aiming to understand the mass angular momentum inequalities for axisymmetric initial data sets which model rotating galaxies in astrophysics.<br/><br/>More specifically, the principal investigator will study the min-max theory for minimal surfaces via both the geometric measure theory approach and the harmonic map approach.  Concerning the geometric measure theory approach, some of the aspects of the min-max theory to be studied in this research program include extensions of the PI's index bound theorem beyond positive Ricci curvature conditions, as well as versions of the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory for more general ambient spaces, including manifolds with boundary and smooth metric measure spaces (where the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor plays a role).  Certain geometric problems related to the Min-max theory will be studied, such as Hersch-type estimates for higher-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces with bounded Morse index.  Concerning the min-max theory via harmonic maps, the PI intends to study the issue of Morse index and branch points of the min-max minimal surfaces constructed by Colding-Minicozzi and himself, and the corresponding free boundary problem."

Riemannian manifolds are higher-dimensional generalizations of the familiar concept of a surface in three-dimensional space, such as the surface of a ball or a donut. Four-dimensional manifolds (with three spatial and one temporal direction) are used in general relativity as models for the universe. Manifolds of other dimensions are used by theoretical physicists in string theory, which may lead to a unification of quantum field theory and gravity. The conferences will bring together distinguished senior speakers and a wide range of junior mathematicians to disseminate recent research progress and catalyze future research in the subject.  The opportunities presented by the meetings to discuss research with leaders in the field will help to train and encourage the next generation of researchers. The conference series makes special efforts to encourage women and minority mathematicians to participate in the meetings. <br/><br/>The field of geometric flows is of great current interest due its many applications to the understanding of Riemannian manifolds. Within Ricci flow for a Riemannian metric, there has been progress in understanding the structure of solutions, their singularities, their asymptotics, and uniqueness. Flows starting from more general initial data (for example, a metric space, or a manifold with unbounded curvature, or an incomplete metric) are becoming better understood. A better understanding of Ricci flow may lead to advances in areas such as general relativity, string theory, the geometry of closed four-dimensional smooth manifolds, and renormalization in quantum field theory. The study of mean curvature flow may lead to advances in knot theory, image processing, materials science, and minimal surfaces. The conference series brings together experts at the frontier of research in these various topics from around the United States. The conference is expected to generate transfers of knowledge, new collaborations, and a cross-fertilization of ideas, and further inspire graduate students and junior mathematicians.

The workshop intends to bring together some leading researches in the area of geometric analysis, a field of research motivated by questions in both pure mathematics and the applied sciences. Geometric analysis is an area that requires tools from different mathematical fields, hence the importance of bringing together researchers with different backgrounds and similar research interests. One of the difficulties faced by researchers in the field is that many problems require a wide variety of geometric and analytic techniques. This often prevents researches working on similar problems from communicating with each other.  This workshop will help overcoming such barriers, assuring that the vast amount of techniques available in the field are shared among its members, and giving incentives to researches to pursue future collaborations. It will also be an opportunity for graduate students to interact with leading researchers and be exposed to cutting-edge developments in the field.<br/><br/>The workshop will focus on problems that require a genuine interplay between methods from modern Riemannian geometry, partial differential equations, and, to a lesser extent, algebraic geometry and topology. It will involve topics such as recent developments in connection with the Yamabe problem and the Yamabe invariant of manifolds, extensions of classical results to manifolds with boundary, mathematical general relativity, recent developments in Kahler geometry, among others.<br/><br/>For more details, see the webpage: https://my.vanderbilt.edu/shanksgeomanalysis/"

Searle <br/><br/>Global Riemannian geometry generalizes the classical Euclidean, Spherical and Hyperbolic geometries to a wide variety of geometric spaces in which the distance between points is described by minimizing the lengths of curves that join those points.  Curvature or bending properties of Riemannian spaces generalize the visual sense we have that a sphere is round (positively curved, with the sense that curvature is related to the diameter of the sphere, and that a sphere of smaller diameter is more greatly curved than a sphere of large diameter) or Euclidean space is flat (of zero curvature). Differential geometers construct local ways to measure the curvature or bending properties of a geometry, and a major goal is to relate these local aspects of a Riemannian space to global properties that are much more flexible and are described as topology.  For example, if a space has the property that around every point there is a neighborhood that is metrically identical to the arctic region of a sphere of radius 1, must the entire space turn out to be identical to that sphere?  (The answer is no, but not by much.)  What happens if those neighborhoods are merely close in metric properties to that arctic region - does changing from constant curvature to allowing small variations change that answer?  Several versions of the notion of curvature are studied, summarizing local geometry in greater or lesser levels of detail, and manifolds with curvature bounds have been studied intensively since the inception of global Riemannian geometry. The projects supported by this grant will study symmetries of Riemannian manifolds and of some related spaces in the presence of lower bounds on curvature.<br/><br/>This research program concerns both sectional curvature and Ricci curvature lower bounds and their corresponding generalizations to Alexandrov spaces, with an eye to gaining a deeper understanding of this largely unknown class of spaces.  Basic problems in this agenda concern the following areas: (1) symmetries and topology of positively and non-negatively curved Riemannian manifolds and Alexandrov spaces and (2) symmetries and topology of Riemannian manifolds of positive Ricci curvature and almost non-negative sectional curvature.  Classification problems in these regimes are both difficult and intriguing, and touch on several mathematical specialties that are neighbors of differential geometry, including Lie groups and their actions on manifolds, as well as algebraic topology."

Those contributions include the solutions of a number of very famous unsolved problems in mathematics, not only in geometry but also in number theory, topology, and other areas. For example, recent solution of the 100-year-old Poincaré Conjecture relied heavily on methods from geometric analysis and metric geometry. This area of mathematics also has applications to physics, chemistry, engineering, and big data analysis. The conference encourages and supports participation by members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.<br/><br/>The technical areas represented in the conference are global and comparison Riemannian geometry, special Riemannian metrics (Einstein, Ricci solitons, and generalizations), isometric group actions, positive curvature, metric geometry, and Alexandrov geometry. The conference features eight plenary speakers and approximately ten shorter talks by early-career mathematicians. The conference activities will bring together leading experts and young researchers and students, facilitating the dissemination of recent research progress and discussion of future directions and open problems.

The manifolds arising in General Relativity are curved by gravity and they can contain black holes or thin deep gravity wells, making it technically difficult to estimate how close the manifold is to a simplified model, like Euclidean space.  New compactness theorems with new notions of convergence are developed in this project providing fundamental new geometric tools that can be applied to address these challenges. The principal investigator has already been invited to present preliminary work in this direction at various mathematics and physics institutions around the world.  As she has in the past, the PI will include young mathematicians of diverse backgrounds in this research project.<br/><br/>The PI will seek intrinsic flat limits of noncollapsing sequences of Riemannian manifolds with uniform lower bounds on scalar curvature. For example, the PI will consider sequences of asymptotically flat Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature whose ADM mass is approaching zero, or regions in such spaces with a uniform upper bound on Hawking mass. Compactness theorems for such sequences would be useful to prove the Almost Rigidity of the Schoen-Yau Positive Mass Theorem or the Bartnik Conjecture. Similar methods will also be applied towards proving Gromov's Almost Rigidity of Flat Tori Conjecture. To avoid cancellation and bubbling, the PI proposes to forbid the existence of arbitrarily small closed minimal surfaces in these and other conjectures stated within the proposal. Various Compactness Theorems for Intrinsic Flat convergence have been proven in different settings by Prof. Wenger, Dr. Portegies, Prof. LeFloch,  Dr. Perales, Dr. Matveev, and the PI. Prior applications of intrinsic flat convergence to General Relativity have been completed in various papers by Prof. Lee, Prof. Huang, Prof. LeFloch, Prof. Stavrov, Prof. Jauregui and the PI."

It is an important part of modern mathematics and is related to many other branches of mathematics. It has solved a large number of problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and mathematical physics. The Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar (SCGAS) is an annual two-day conference that rotates between the University of California - Irvine and the University of California - San Diego.  <br/><br/>The conference features talks given by world leaders.  The Seminar promotes interaction among mathematicians in Southern California who are interested in geometric analysis and related areas and to introduce graduate students and post-docs to some of the best works in geometric analysis.

Using the analysis and the partial differential equations as its main tools with differential geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry as foundations, geometric analysis has solved a large number of problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and mathematical physics. One example is the resolution of the celebrated Poincare conjecture via the study of the Ricci flow. As the success of the first twenty three meetings have demonstrated, the SCGAS conference has now become an important and anticipated event for the southern California region and has also attracted a substantial number of participants from the rest of the country each year. Indeed, it is the unique annual meeting of its kind in the southern California area, and continues to foster interests in geometric analysis at all levels.

There has been substantial progress in conformal geometry that is motivated by this correspondence with theoretic physics. As a consequence of these projects, more interactions between mathematics and physics will be brought out, thereby achieving better understanding of geometric structure of low dimensional spaces.<br/><br/>Fefferman and Graham's seminal paper in the 1980s developed an ambient space approach to study local scalar invariants for conformal geometry and empowered the partial differential equation approach to the study of conformal geometry.

To develop a mathematical foundation for this correspondence in the spirit of Fefferman and Graham requires the study of conformally compact Einstein manifolds and various mathematical interpretations of such a correspondence. The most fundamental question on the existence of conformally compact Einstein manifold for a given conformal manifold as the prescribed conformal infinity remains largely open. The project will investigate the general compactness property for conformally compact Einstein manifolds, which will lead to more general existence theory.

In the setting of non-commutative geometry where the notion of locality ceases to make sense, these intuitions usually offer little guidance, so that mathematicians are forced to fall back on algebraic and computational tools. The study of symplectic manifolds provides, via mirror symmetry, an approach to non-commutative geometry that starts from an honest geometric space and produces a non-commutative one formed by a class of subspaces called Lagrangians. For example, the algebras known to mathematicians as Clifford algebras and to physicists as Dirac matrices arise from the study of circles in the sphere. This research project will investigate such non-commutative spaces in higher dimensions, relating them to a program whose goal is to understand symplectic manifolds via the associated non-commutative spaces known as Fukaya categories. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the setting of symplectic manifolds admitting Lagrangian torus fibrations.

Over the years, mathematicians have developed various topological invariants, or in other words, quantities that are associated to shapes and can distinguish between those that have different properties. Homology is a well-known such invariant, which can be associated to any multi-dimensional shape, and which is a quantitative measure of the number of holes in a space. A circle, for instance, has only a one-dimensional hole, whereas the surface of a doughnut has two one-dimensional holes, a meridian and a longitude, that are not filled in by the surface itself, and an additional two-dimensional hole. Floer homology is a more refined invariant that is responsible for some of the most important recent advances in the study of knotted closed loops in space, three-dimensional shapes, and shapes with a geometry known as a symplectic structure that is exhibited by phase spaces in classical mechanics. This project brings together several researchers working in different areas of topology and geometry to study Floer homology. The main goal of the project is the following: To every knot, three-dimensional shape, or symplectic shape, one should associate a different object, called a Floer space or a Floer homotopy type, whose (ordinary) homology is the Floer homology of the initial shape. This has been accomplished so far in a limited number of cases. A general theory of Floer spaces will lead to new advances in several areas. Furthermore, the study of Floer spaces will be based on techniques from a subfield of topology called homotopy theory. This project will create a community of scholars at the interface of these current and extremely research active areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Floer homology is a fundamental tool in geometry and topology, whose applications range from the Arnold conjecture to the surgery characterization of various knots. Floer homology has also laid the basis for completely unexpected interconnections between algebraic and symplectic geometry in the form of homological mirror symmetry. Floer homotopy theory, an extension to spaces rather than homology groups, has been implemented in a small number of cases, leading to significant applications, for example, the resolution of the triangulation conjecture in high dimensions and work on immersed Lagrangian spheres. Further, the ideas behind Floer homotopy inspired the construction of a Khovanov homotopy type associated to knots in the three-sphere. The main scientific goal of this project is to give a general construction of Floer homotopy. The necessary foundational work will build upon recent advances in multiple areas. These include the conceptual advances in equivariant stable homotopy theory stemming from the resolution of Kervaire invariant one problem, and the development of new approaches to define virtual fundamental classes in Floer theory. The project aims to put the homotopical and homological variants of Floer theory on equal footing. As a consequence, new applications in both symplectic and low-dimensional topology are anticipated, for example: (i) a spectral Fukaya category associated to a symplectic manifold will be constructed; (ii) the Heegaard Floer theory of Ozsvath and Szabo will be used to produce a computable invariant parallel to the celebrated Bauer-Furuta invariant for four-manifolds; (iii) Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy types will be studied using the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory; and (iv) the Khovanov homotopy type will be extended to give invariants of knot cobordisms and tangles."

New ideas and concepts such as information, entropy, chaos and fractals have changed our understanding of the world. Dynamics and ergodic theory provide excellent mathematical tools, and have a strong impact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics for example has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is a highly developed and ancient field in mathematics of amazing vigor.  It studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.  Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, starting with Gauss in the nineteenth century. It is closely linked with physics and other sciences and applied areas such as computer vision. Geometry and dynamics are closely related. Indeed, important dynamical systems come from geometry, and vice versa geometry provides tools to study dynamical systems. One main goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Alternatively, these are systems with unexpected symmetries Important examples of such systems arise from geometry when the space contains many flat subspaces.  Group theory finally enters both dynamics and geometry by studying the group of symmetries of a geometry or dynamical situation, or by investigating the dynamical and geometric behavior of the group of symmetries acting on a space.<br/><br/>This project centers on problems between dynamical systems, group theory and geometry. There are two main goals: First, establish exponential mixing properties for several different systems in dynamics, in particular frame flows from Riemannian geometry and solenoids coming from noninvertible systems. The principal investigator (PI) will draw tools from dynamics, geometry and number theory to accomplish these goals. Second, prove rigidity properties in geometry and in dynamical systems, in particular when the system and spaces in question are ""higher rank"", e.g. when spaces have flat subspaces or the dynamics has nontrivially commuting elements. Such systems appear naturally in seemingly quite separate areas, for example in number theory or in studying the spectrum of the Laplacian. The investigator will work on rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and semi-simple Lie groups and their lattices striving to classify such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical hypotheses.  The PI will employ tools from geometry, dynamics, Lie groups, and specifically exponential mixing properties.  The PI will also investigate discrete faithful representations of hyperbolic groups in p-adic Lie groups, equilibrium states for partially hyperbolic dynamical systems and spherical higher rank in Riemannian geometry."

This project aims to significantly enhance the intensive and fruitful interaction between cutting edge research in enumerative algebraic geometry and theoretical physics. The research aims to extend mathematical developments that verify and generalize conjectures originating from physics, and the work is expected to significantly impact development of the physical theory as well. Through conferences, a summer school, seminars, and research involvement, this project provides unique opportunities for a new generation of mathematicians to obtain the interdisciplinary knowledge and skills needed to work in this exciting research area.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to study enumerative invariants in the broad sense and their dependence on various stability conditions, as well as dualities relating different enumerative invariants. The investigators plan to further develop the theory of Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSM) and will study the epsilon-wall-crossing conjecture and zeta-wall-crossing conjecture at all genera; Gromov-Witten (GW) and quasimap invariants are related by a sequence of epsilon-wall-crossing, whereas the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence (relating GW invariants and FJRW invariants) and Pfaffian/Grassmannian correspondence are examples of zeta-wall-crossing. The investigators are developing the theory of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) fields, to interpolate GW theory of quintic threefolds and FJRW theory of Fermat quintic polynomials, and to study algebraic structures of higher genus GW and FJRW invariants. The new theories of GLSM and MSP fields will provide new tools to attack the central and longstanding problem of computing higher genus GW invariants of compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. The investigators have been investigating K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of threefolds, as well as GW and quasimap invariants of Nakajima quiver varieties. Because some of conjectures motivated by theoretical physics can only be properly formulated in terms of K-theoretic enumerative invariants, they plan to study dualities relating K-theoretic enumerative invariants of different geometries, and to lift results on traditional enumerative invariants to the K-theoretic setting."

It was a much celebrated achievement of Perelman who successfully tackled the problem about ten years ago. He adopted an approach developed by Hamilton who has devised a way of deforming an arbitrary metric via a set of differential equations. A crucial step in understanding this set of equations for Perelman is to classify the so-called self-similar solutions. The current project aims to extend Perelman's work to dimension four and beyond. It is expected that the results will aid in the study of four dimensional spaces. <br/> <br/>Ricci solitons, as self-similar solutions to the Ricci flows, play a central role in the singularity analysis of the Ricci flows. The main theme of this project is to study shrinking Ricci solitons. In dimensions two and three, they have been completely classified. The classification has found important applications in the resolution of the Poincare and geometrization conjecture for three dimensional manifolds. The current project aims to obtain a classification for four dimensional complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons, building upon the recent progress including curvature estimates and a description of the structure at infinity. Another goal of the project is to lay some foundation toward a possible classification for high dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci solitons."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

This observation goes back to Fermat and Euler, and broadly speaking it says that, by the laws of nature, things are carried out in the most economical way. The phenomenon applies to many facets of physics, including Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, even general relativity. The abstract mathematical framework that studies such phenomena is the calculus of variations, and the principal investigator will apply this in the context of differential geometry. Namely, in differential geometry one often has a large collection of geometric objects (in this case Kahler metrics or Lagrangians) and is searching for special elements in this collection that have the nicest properties. These special elements often minimize a certain energy functional, and this is the starting point of the project. A thorough understanding of the problems at hand can lead to new insight into the shape of the universe, and it would help make exciting predictions in string theory and, more broadly, in theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This project can be split into three main subjects: characterizing existence of constant scalar curvature metrics on Kahler manifolds; convexity and curvature properties of the L^p-Finsler geometry of the space of Kahler metrics, their finite dimensional approximations, and the structure of the associated space of geodesic rays; the metric structure of the space of positive Lagrangians. As a novelty, in the proposed study we will either specifically develop or use an adequate metric geometry, in hopes of understanding the underlying variational problems better. The metric spaces that the PI plans to use arise from the path length structure of infinite dimensional Finsler manifolds, and as such have a very rich geometry themselves. In the Kahler case it is hopeful that this will allow one to connect many notions of stability, including K-stability from the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, the energy properness of Tian, and geodesic stability, all conjectured to characterize existence of constant scalar curvature metrics. In the case of Lagrangian geometry much less is known. Following a recent program proposed by Solomon, the principal investigator intends to develop the underlying metric geometry further in order to formulate and prove stability conditions characterizing existence of special Lagrangians."

He will enhance the training opportunities available to graduate students at the University of North Carolina by organizing mini-schools on advanced topics, by promoting student-led seminars, and by modernizing the geometry and topology courses. At the undergraduate level he will lead a problem solving seminar to coach students for mathematics competitions, facilitate research through honors projects, and initiate a new study abroad summer program for math majors and potential math majors.

He aims to show that every hyperkähler manifold can be deformed to a Lagrangian fibration, a hyperkähler manifold admitting a holomorphic fibre space structure. He then plans to establish general finiteness results by refining his earlier results for Lagrangian fibrations. He will exploit the analogies between compact and non-compact Lagrangian fibrations, such as Hitchin systems, to find new examples.

Independent of their origin in physics, Einstein manifolds are beautiful mathematical objects in their own right whose study links together many disparate areas of mathematics. The space underlying an Einstein manifold usually has dimension 4 or higher, which makes it difficult to visualize such structures. However, Einstein manifolds in dimension 4 share many basic features with minimal surfaces in dimension 2, which have been a staple of mathematical research and popularization for decades.<br/><br/>It is a key feature of nonlinear partial differential equations that solutions may form singularities and break down at points of infinite physical field strength.

CMC surfaces are also critical for the area functional, but with constraint now given by enclosed volume. Delaunay determined a family of CMC examples in 1841, but it was another 150 years before any new examples were known, at which time Kapouleas produced infinitely many new examples via gluing techniques. The variational solutions studied in this project have characterizations in many areas of mathematics and the proposed questions and desired results are of broad interest in mathematics and beyond.<br/><br/>The PI will continue her study of classical questions in geometric analysis related to the existence, regularity, and compactness of solutions to variational problems. The project will use and refine the gluing techniques pioneered by Kapouleas to produce new examples of minimal and CMC surfaces. The understanding of singularity development for a sequence of complete, properly embedded minimal disks, developed by Colding-Minicozzi, was of critical importance for the resolution of the uniqueness of the helicoid. In contrast to the picture developed when the disks are complete and proper, the structure of the singular set for sequences of embedded minimal disks with boundary in a ball can be pathological. These pathological examples are helpful in the resolution of uniqueness and regularity results. Gluing techniques will be used to produce even wilder singularities in settings where problems are intractable via former techniques. For CMC gluing, the project aims to extend the generalized gluing techniques developed in Euclidean space to more general manifolds. In the setting of harmonic maps, the aim of the project is to establish the existence of conformal harmonic maps into metric spaces with upper curvature bounds. This work generalizes a classical result of Sacks and Uhlenbeck on the existence of minimal 2-spheres.

Simple algebraic transformations already exhibit many of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes. These universal patterns may be revealed through the rigorous study of so-called moduli spaces, their compactifications, and their stratifications by dynamical invariants. This research project appeals to a broad range of mathematical disciplines to both deepen our understanding of dynamical systems and to sharpen our mathematical and computational methods. Its methods have already led to the discovery of new and unexpected algebraic regimes, through a combination of theoretical tools that narrow the domain of search, and experimental methods such as the simulation of billiard flows in idealized polygons. <br/><br/>Moduli spaces of lattices, Riemann surfaces, rational maps and other algebraic structures exhibit rich geometry, often accompanied by rigidity and a connection with arithmetic.

In the setting of Riemann surfaces, the project aims to reveal the mechanisms within dynamics, algebraic geometry, and number theory that underlie the existence of unexpected, recently-discovered primitive, totally geodesic complex surfaces in moduli space.

In modern language one studies groups of symmetries and groups of transformations. The overarching theme of the project is to study phenomena in dynamics and geometry that occur in the presence of large groups (i.e., situations with a lot of explicit or implicit symmetries). This research continues important work over the last few decades that connects topics in geometry, probability theory, dynamical systems, and number theory.<br/><br/>More specifically, the proposal focuses on three areas: (1) measured group theory - an ergodic-theoretic analogue of geometric group theory; (2) further study of higher-rank super-rigidity phenomena; and (3) study of Lyapunov exponents in the classical context of the multiplicative ergodic theorem in the presence of large groups. The first topic includes study of rigidity for rank-one lattices in analogy with previously established rigidity results for higher-rank lattices. Another promising direction is development of a measured analogue of Gromov-hyperbolic groups. The second theme includes study of rigidity phenomena for groups that resemble but are different from higher-rank lattices, but admit rich Weyl groups. The third topic develops a method of establishing simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum using certain group actions - this investigation connects now classical results on random products of matrices, geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds, and recent developments in Teichmuller dynamics."

Higgs bundles, the solutions to these equations over a two-dimensional space, appear at the interface of geometry, physics, and representation theory. Understanding Higgs bundles through spectral data allows one to see a beautiful interplay between physical objects and properties of different Higgs bundles. This approach is appealing not only because of its intrinsic interest, but also because it is wonderfully suited for collaborations among several branches of mathematics and physics. The main goal of the project is to understand how Higgs bundles and their spectral data can provide new tools to study various geometric and physical questions. <br/><br/>Remarkably, there are often elegant and simple characterizations of topological invariants of the moduli space of surface group representations (and of branes in the A- or B-model) in terms of combinatorial and geometric values associated to the spectral data of the corresponding Higgs bundles. The spectral data approach may be extended to Higgs bundles with singularities, and the PI is currently carrying out a program to do so. By considering the hyperkahler structure of the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles, the PI and a collaborator constructed a triple of natural anti-holomorphic involutions whose fixed point sets are new examples of branes in the A-model and B-model, some of them closely related to the representation variety of 3-manifolds. Obtaining a better understanding of the relation between the topology of 3-manifolds and subspaces of Higgs bundles is something the PI is pursuing, in particular by studying the relation of Higgs bundles with knot and graph compliments. Finally, the PI is also considering Langlands duality by looking at the Fourier-Mukai transform on the spectral data for the families of branes, which should provide some of the necessary objects needed for quantization of character varieties and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles from the perspective of curve and brane quantization."

Such discrete dynamical systems occur as models throughout science and engineering.  Polynomials and rational functions of a single variable provide basic examples of non-invertible, algebraic, discrete dynamical systems by iteration. Even the simplest families of examples exhibit complicated and chaotic dynamical behavior; the most famous is the family of quadratic polynomials where a point x is mapped to x ""squared"" plus a constant. The constant can be a real or complex number. This family gives rise to the Mandelbrot set, which continues to baffle researchers. A fundamental problem in the mathematical study of these systems is to characterize their stability: under what circumstances -- and by how much -- can we perturb a system while maintaining its long-term dynamical features? The primary goal of this research project is to explore connections between the stability of algebraic dynamical systems and the algebraic or geometric structures that are preserved under iteration. The first connections between the algebra and dynamics of these models were discovered in the 19th century. This project will exploit modern tools from arithmetic geometry and dynamical systems to strengthen these connections and deepen our understanding of the systems themselves. <br/><br/>The project studies: (1) the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, with dynamical methods; (2) a series of substantial conjectures about ""unlikely intersections"" in moduli spaces of dynamical systems; and (3) the 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry of a rational function, with curvature form equal to its measure of maximal entropy. The main goal of this project is to build relations between the algebra and the geometry of dynamical systems on algebraic varieties, with an eye towards applications in Diophantine geometry. The second goal of the project is a study of rational maps in dimension one, particularly an exploration of the canonical shape of the dynamical system and its stability properties. In recent work, the investigator and collaborator developed new methods of proof incorporating tools from both complex and non-Archimedean analysis and formulated a conjecture about the dynamics of rational maps that encompasses known results about elliptic curves. This project aims to investigate particular cases of this conjecture while developing the theory to connect these results to the study of the symmetries and stability and invariants of complex dynamical systems in dimensions one and two."

The PI will focus on two important examples: minimal submanifolds and geometric flows. Minimal submanifolds are subspaces that locally minimize area (or volume). They have been studied since the work of Euler and Lagrange, yielding many applications to geometry and other related fields such as low-dimensional topology and general relativity. Moreover, they are important models for many interesting non-linear phenomena in nature and a variety of ideas developed in their study have turned out to be key in the calculus of variations, geometric PDEs, and mathematical physics. A geometric flow, on the other hand, is a process of deforming a given geometry through a parabolic system of PDEs coming from curvature. A prominent example is the flow by the Ricci curvature, or Ricci flow, which has had seminal consequences to the geometrization of three-dimensional spaces by the work of Hamilton and Perelman. <br/><br/>One of the tenets of this research project is that the existence of minimal submanifolds of certain topological and Morse index type can impose restrictions on the curvature of the ambient manifold, and vice-versa.

Another aspect is the singularity formation phenomena in geometric flows, with a focus on the profiles of singularities and their rigidity and stability properties."

Second, he will study the effective scope of geometric invariant theory (GIT) invented by Hilbert and Mumford on the construction of algebraic moduli based on the work of the PI and his collaborators.

Successful completion of this work could result in faster algorithms related to meshing, as used in graphics, medical imaging, and a wide variety of design and manufacturing applications.<br/><br/>The project divides into several broad areas: transcendental dynamics, Brownian motion, and the interactions of analysis with computational geometry. Continuing earlier work, the PI will study problems such as computing the dimension of Julia sets of entire functions, investigating the existence of wandering domains with bounded orbits, and studying the escaping set (points that iterate to infinity). The PI will also work on related geometric problems for random sets such as Brownian motion, considering both well known questions (does Brownian motion cover any rectifiable arcs?) as well as more novel ones (is Brownian motion removable for conformal maps? Does the set of cut-points lie on a rectifiable curve?) Finally, the PI will work on extending his earlier algorithms for optimal meshing, triangulation and conformal mapping using ideas from analysis, geometry and topology. The most interesting generalization would be to three dimensions, where no rigorous complexity bounds are known, but where the most important applications lie. The proposal also considers problems in ""pure"" analysis that might be solved using strengthened versions of known results in computational geometry; one such problem is the connectedness of the space of chord-arc curves in the BMO topology; another is the factoring of general bi-Lipschitz maps into bi-Lipschitz maps with small constants."

The primary aim of this event is to gather together leading experts in Differential Geometry, Geometric Analysis, and Mathematical Physics. The dual aim is to expose graduate students and young mathematicians in the USA and Canada to the new developments. Participation by both U.S. researchers and graduate students is crucial and is greatly encouraged. As a branch of Mathematics, Differential Geometry studies the shapes of spaces through distances and angles. The key concept involved is that of a so-called curvature, the simplest kind  being the scalar curvature function on a space. The existence of a constant scalar curvature  metric, the twistor theory and the special structure in geometry and physics are of major importance in Differential Geometry. It lies in the inter-play of geometry and physics, thus it naturally has impacts in both differential geometry and physics. Moreover, the main topics of the proposed conference has impacts on algebraic geometry and partial differential equations. <br/><br/>In recent years, important progress has been made in the understanding of the geometry of 4-manifolds where we have seen fundamental progress in the theory of  self-dual and Einstein metrics, Seiberg-Witten theory, the Yamabe problem on 4-manifolds, and the Calabi  problem in Kahler geometry.  The conference centers around the topics below (but not limited to): (1) special structures in geometry and physics; (2) complex methods in conformal geometry and twistor theory, and (3) extremal Kahler metrics.<br/><br/>For details, please check the webpage http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/LeBrunFest16/aidAutreLEBRUN_e.php."

This project focuses on a special class of manifolds called G2 manifolds. These 7-dimensional spaces play a vital role in theoretical physics, particularly in the so-called M-theory. Besides their physical interest, G2 manifolds provide a rich geometric structure, an ideal setting to study beautiful and deep interactions between objects arising in different parts of geometry such as Riemannian and spin geometry, submanifold geometry, and gauge theory. Since G2 manifolds are odd-dimensional, the methods of complex geometry cannot be applied directly, unlike the case of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which are the 6-dimensional counterpart appearing in string theory of theoretical physics. As a result, the current understanding of G2 manifolds is limited. Additional difficulties arise from the fact that the G2 manifolds of interest to M-theorists must contain special points that mathematicians call singularities. Inspired by one of the expected physical dualities between string theory and M-theory, the project aims to develop a new construction of G2 manifolds and explore its consequences. The key idea is to relate G2 geometry to the better understood Calabi-Yau geometry through the phenomenon of collapsing: the aim is to construct 7-dimensional G2 manifolds that look very close to Calabi-Yau manifolds of one lower dimension. <br/><br/>The expected physical duality between Type IIA string theory and M-theory compactified on a circle can be interpreted geometrically as the existence of sequences of compact G2 manifolds collapsing to Calabi-Yau three-folds. Non-compact examples of these collapsing phenomena have appeared in the physics and mathematics literature since the early 2000s. The project aims to study these complete examples more thoroughly and use them as local models for the behavior of compact G2 manifolds in various gluing constructions. Goals of the research project are: (i) to develop a new construction of compact G2 manifolds close to a Calabi-Yau 3-fold collapsed limit; (ii) to extend the construction to produce the first known examples of compact G2 manifolds with isolated conical singularities; and (iii) to study the smoothing theory of these singular G2 manifolds and exhibit examples of ""geometric transitions"" in G2 geometry analogous to flops in Calabi-Yau geometry. Besides the rigorous mathematical verification of expectations in M-theory, success in achieving these goals would potentially generate more diffeomorphism types of compact 7-manifolds known to admit a torsion-free G2 structure, advance understanding of complete non-compact Ricci flat manifolds in higher dimensions with interesting asymptotic geometries beyond the asymptotically conical and asymptotically cylindrical case, and contribute to understanding of the boundary of the moduli space of smooth G2 manifolds. As a lower-dimensional analogue of these constructions, bubbling phenomena occurring in sequences of Ricci-flat metrics on K3 surfaces collapsing to lower-dimensional limits will also be studied."

The project focuses especially on spaces which are poorly described by classical Euclidean language, such as fractals and sub-Riemannian spaces.  The latter occur as mathematical models for problems in robotics, neurobiology, celestial mechanics and other physical systems.  In each of these models, the underlying geometry is inherently nonsmooth. The proposed research will consequently contribute to developing the mathematical framework which simultaneously underlies a variety of physical applications. On the geometric side, nonsmooth notions of curvature will be studied.  Curvature is a fundamental concept in modern geometry.  For instance, general relativity predicts that curvature is the primary geometric feature of space responsible for gravity.  Nonsmooth generalizations of curvature and their relationship to the structure of measures will also be studied.  Measure theory is a wide-ranging mathematical generalization of fundamental concepts of length, area, and volume.  Finally, analysis refers to the dynamic properties of transformations acting between spaces. Since the classical Newton--Leibniz theory of the derivative is not well-adapted to transformations of nonsmooth spaces, there is currently significant interest in developing a new analytic toolkit to extend the machinery of calculus beyond its usual context.  The principle investigator will continue to train graduate students, postdocs and early-career researchers.  Results of this research program will be disseminated via talks at conferences and workshops, publication of journal articles, and exposition for a general mathematical audience.  The PI is currently coauthoring a graduate textbook on analysis in nonsmooth spaces.  The ongoing preparation of this book will be coordinated with advances in the field, including those obtained as part of this research program.<br/><br/>The project concerns the geometry of measures and submanifolds in, and mappings between, sub-Riemannian manifolds.  Three coordinating themes will be considered.  The first set of problems concerns density of measures and the geometry of submanifolds.  The main goal is a sub-Riemannian analog of a celebrated theorem of David Preiss characterizing rectifiability (a measure-theoretic notion of smoothness) via densities.  This line of investigation will extend to the sub-Riemannian setting some fundamental aspects of Euclidean geometric measure theory tied to notions of curvature for submanifolds.  The primary methodology for this investigation involves the approximation of sub-Riemannian spaces by Riemannian spaces, and an analysis of the limiting behavior of geometric quantities in the Riemannian approximations.  The second theme concerns iteration of conformal and quasiregular mappings.  Such iterative schemes provide a basic combinatorial model for fractal objects. They arise naturally in both hyperbolic geometry and number theory.  Building on his previous work for similarity mappings, the principle investigator will extend the analysis to conformal mappings.  The goal is a detailed description of the geometry of self-conformal limit sets in sub-Riemannian spaces and natural measures on such sets. Finally, the principle investigator will study the type problem for sub-Riemannian quasiregular mappings. The goal here is to understand both the flexibility of quasiregular mappings as well as inherent geometric obstructions to their construction.  The principle investigator will also investigate new constructions of Sobolev mappings inducing optimal measure and dimension distortion, as well as criteria for the density of Lipschitz mappings in spaces of Sobolev mappings with sub-Riemannian targets.  The principle investigator will take advantage of his prior expertise in all of the aforementioned areas, as well as the latest advances in related fields, to pursue answers to the proposed problems.  The proposed research will have a broad impact; it addresses a wide range of questions at the intersection of different mathematical areas. The principle investigator will use this broad framework to identify specific problems suitable for beginning graduate students and postdocs."

This is a central area of mathematics with a vast range of applications, a small sampling of which includes physics, cryptography, and computational complexity (the design of faster, more efficient computational algorithms). A powerful tool in the subject is Hodge theory, which associates a linear algebraic structure to a set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations. The advantage of this association is that the Hodge structure is often more amenable to computation and analysis than the original set of solutions, while at the same time retaining enough information to yield deep insights into the set of solutions (and the questions that one would like to answer about them). The principal objective of this research project is to develop Hodge theory so that it can be applied to a greater range of problems in algebraic geometry. <br/><br/>The project will address a collection of problems in complex geometry and Lie theory that are motivated by Hodge theory. In practice this means that many of the questions concern (generalized) flag manifolds and flag domains, a canonical system of geometric partial differential equations on these spaces (whose integrals are called horizontal submanifolds), and locally homogeneous spaces. In Hodge theory, flag domains arise as period domains, the classifying spaces for polarized Hodge structures; flag manifolds as compact duals of period domains; the canonical system of geometric PDE as the infinitesimal period relation, Griffiths' system of differential equations constraining variations of Hodge structure. The work will include: (1) a generalization of the Satake-Baily-Borel compactification and Borel's extension theorem for locally Hermitian symmetric spaces to a class of locally homogeneous spaces of Hodge theoretic interest; (2) investigation of a conjectural mixed Hodge structure on the characteristic cohomology of the infinitesimal period relation; and (3) initiation of a program to study the extent to which a variation of Hodge structure is determined by its characteristic varieties."

A meeting of this type brings together researchers from the academically young to the well-established, yet offers a more narrow research focus than is typically found at undergraduate-inclusive conferences. This narrow focus serves to promote more meaningful contact in the context of mathematical research. The conference is intended to fuel young mathematicians' interest in research mathematics, promote inter- and intra-generational research ties, and demonstrate how undergraduates can be incorporated into research programs in these fields.<br/><br/>Three established speakers and three early-career speakers are invited by the organizing committee; these speakers are chosen both for their eminence in their respective fields and their ability to provide meaningful introductions to complex topics for audiences with a wide range of mathematical backgrounds. Invitations for submissions by graduate students and undergraduate students will be issued in mid-February. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-specific committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6 graduate students and between 12 and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make presentations, either as talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the conference provides opportunities for less formal interaction, including social events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our increased focus on incorporating undergraduates into professional life includes panel discussions from funded graduate students and early-career mathematicians covering important but seldom-discussed aspects of attending graduate school and pursuing an academic career in mathematics.<br/><br/>More information will be available at the conference website: https://ux1.eiu.edu/~gdt/2016.html"

The goal is to study the monotonicity and the variational properties of quasi-local mass. For the second part of the project, the PI plans to investigate other quasi-local conserved quantities in GR.

Finally, the PI plans to study gravitational radiation. The research will be based on PI's previous work with Lydia Bieri and Shing-Tung Yau on the memory effect where the radiation of gravitational energy is related to measurement of displacements of test particles. The PI plans to investigate gravitational radiation using quasi-local mass and to study the role of other conserved quantities in gravitational radiation.<br/><br/>While the concept of total energy of isolated systems is important in general relativity, the measurement of mass, momentum or angular momentum contained in a finite region is essential in many fundamental problems in general relativity. This is particularly important due to the non-local nature of gravitation. The proposed research evaluates the energy, momentum or angular momentum contained in any region of the universe. This allows the study of general relativity in regions where the gravitational field is strong. As a result, the proposed research will lead to a better understanding of formation of black holes and the gravitational radiation during the process."

These equations are of the evolution type and involve the curvature which measures how a space is curved. They play a fundamental role in understanding the natural world through mathematical means and are closely related to the study of the field theories in physics. They have also found many deep applications in geometry and topology. A famous example is Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture by using Ricci flow. The resolution of the problems in this project will provide mathematical foundations for some physical theories and have further profound applications to long-standing mathematical problems such as the classification of algebraic spaces. The most common phenomena of these equations are their singular behaviors due to the nonlinearity of the equations. Such behaviors are reflected in the possible break-downs in the evolution process and described in terms of singular solutions to these equations which describe the evolution process. It is still challenging to have a complete mathematical understanding of these singular solutions. This project will address some basic problems on these singular solutions and explore their applications to geometry and topology. The PI will give lectures and teach graduate courses on topics directly related to this project. He will also run a geometry working seminar with a goal of helping students to gain research experiences and broaden their knowledge in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project concerns curvature flows and equations in Riemannian geometry. For Ricci flow, the PI will focus on (1) Finite time singularity formation for its solutions in Kahler geometry; (2) The interaction between the singularity formation and geometry of the underlying spaces; (3) The long-time behavior of the solutions. For the Hermitian curvature flow, the PI will develop new analytic tools to study how it forms singularity. One of most prominent Hermitian curvature flow is the pluriclosed flow which is connected to the renormalization group flow of the nonlinear sigma model with B-field. The PI will further explore this connection and gives new mathematical insights for the duality in the string theory on one hand, new understanding of finite-time singularity on the other hand. For the symplectic curvature flow, the PI intends to study how to characterize the maximal existence of the flow by cohomological condition and how it develops finite-time singularity in dimension 4. The PI also intends to extend the compactness theory for Einstein metrics to a more general class of Kahler metrics and 4-dimensional anti-self-dual metrics. He also continues his study on fundamental problems in symplectic geometry which involve certain gauge equation. The problems include constructing new deformation invariants for symplectic manifolds which admit a Hamiltonian S1-action and providing a mathematical theory for the gauged linear sigma model. These problems are important in symplectic geometry and are inspired by the topological field theories in physics."

Symplectic geometry is the fundamental geometry underlying classical mechanics and dynamics. The set of possible states of a macroscopic physical system is described by a symplectic manifold, and the geometry of this symplectic manifold is essential for understanding how the physical system evolves over time. Symplectic field theory (SFT), initiated in 2000 by Eliashberg-Givental-Hofer, is a major program for understanding symplectic geometry by counting pseudoholomorphic curves (a kind of area-minimizing surfaces) in symplectic manifolds, and performing these counts by cutting symplectic manifolds into simpler pieces. Since 2005, a series of workshops on particular aspects of SFT has been held at various locations in Germany, and these workshops have played a key role in the development of the subject. Each such workshop consists of a week of mini-courses, research lectures, and discussions, preceded by a weekend of introductory courses reviewing necessary background material. In August 2016, the eighth SFT workshop will be held in Berlin, and this grant will provide travel support to enable junior US-based participants to participate in the workshop.<br/><br/>The specific topic of the workshop is symplectic homology. In the past decade, symplectic homology has emerged as a central tool in symplectic and contact geometry and topology, with a number of spectacular applications. The uses of symplectic homology include distinguishing exotic Stein structures and contact structures, detecting Reeb orbits of vector fields, and obstructing Lagrangian cobordisms. In addition, a closely related invariant, the wrapped Fukaya category, plays an essential role in recent developments in mirror symmetry. This workshop will bring together the major recent advances in the structure and applications of symplectic homology, in an in-depth and coordinated manner, in order to form this vital subject into a coherent whole and make it accessible to a wider audience. The centerpiece of the workshop will consist of mini-courses by Tobias Ekholm on the Legendrian surgery formula and its applications, Alexandru Oancea on the symplectic Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, and Mark McLean on wrapped Floer cohomology and affine varieties. In addition there will be five research lectures and a weekend precourse with six background talks. Sending US participants to this workshop will enable US mathematicians to keep up with the latest developments in symplectic geometry and contribute to the future of the subject.

In mathematics, Teichmueller theory is the study of the shapes that a surface can assume. In this project, surfaces, their geodesics (shortest paths), and their evolution will be studied in two different settings.

Surfaces are fundamental objects in geometry, and the shape of surfaces in a space provides insight into the space.  The behavior of surfaces that are minimal or near-minimal is especially important.  For example, minimal surfaces, like soap films, are known to be smooth under many conditions, but surfaces that are only close to minimal can be rough. The PI intends to develop new tools to study minimal and close-to-minimal surfaces in a variety of spaces and use them to study geometric and analytical problems.  One proposed application of these tools is the study of the accuracy of the Goemans-Linial algorithm, an algorithm to approximate the best way of cutting an object into two roughly equal pieces.  This algorithm is a key ingredient in many ""divide-and-conquer"" algorithms, which solve complex problems by decomposing them into simpler ones.<br/><br/>The PI plans to develop new quantitative tools for studying the geometry of surfaces in groups and spaces and apply them to questions in geometric group theory, geometric measure theory, and theoretical computer science.  First, the project aims to prove a conjecture of Gromov and Thurston on the filling functions of lattices in symmetric spaces, providing new understanding of the large-scale geometry of these spaces.  Second, the project will explore decompositions of surfaces embedded in Euclidean space and try to use new tools from geometric measure theory to bound the geometry and topology of these surfaces.  Third, the project will analyze surfaces of finite perimeter in the Heisenberg group and other nilpotent groups.  If this last goal is successful, it would lead to sharp bounds on embeddings of the Heisenberg group into Banach spaces and sharp bounds on the accuracy of the best known approximate solution to the Sparsest Cut problem."

The Program starts with a week of (Australian) summer school aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, followed by two week-long international conferences featuring talks by experts from all over the world on the subjects listed in the title, and with diverse background. The focus of the Program is to find a systematic mathematical understanding of the physical idea of `quantization' applied to functions in two variables. Quantization was discovered by Planck, Einstein, Heisenberg, Schoedinger, Dirac, and other giants in the early 20th century, as a procedure to change classical Newtonian mechanics to then newly discovered quantum mechanics. One hundred years later, the same quantization plays a role of discovering new keys, or invariants, to identify finer structures of  spaces surrounding us. The classical invariants are called homology and homotopy of the space, and these tell us the coarse structure. The quantum invariants tell us far more refined information of the given space. The designed interaction between U.S. researchers and Australian mathematicians is expected to fertilize the study of this exciting new area of research. At the same time, the Program aims at inspiring early career researchers, in particular, women scientists, into this field.<br/><br/>The Program will gather leading experts from both mathematics and physics to address recent advances and explore new connections between topology, number theory, and topological recursion. Such a meeting is particularly timely as quantum invariants in low-dimensional topology are discovered, while topological recursion and quantum curves are making rapid advances. Connections between these fields are now becoming rigorous mathematical theory. On the topology side, in the past four years we have witnessed exciting activity on the connection between number theory and ideal triangulations of (mostly hyperbolic) 3-manifolds. On topological recursion side, the most notable achievement is the recent solution of the Remodeling Conjecture of toric Calabi-Yau orbifolds of dimension three. And on the quantization aspect of the interplay, Gaiotto's conjecture on quantizing Higgs bundles of Hitchin component is solved. The Program aims at studying outstanding conjectures, including (1) Hyperbolic Volume Conjecture; (2) AJ-Conjecture; and (3) Quantum Modularity Conjecture. New ideas from topological recursion and quantum curves are expected to play a key role on studying these conjectures. A significant advance on the field is expected as a result of the 4-week activity.

Topological recursion is an emerging field of mathematics discovered independently in the study of random matrices and in studies of dynamics and geometry. The novelty of topological recursion is its universal applicability to many problems arising in areas of mathematics and quantum physics.  For example, Catalan numbers, simple combinatorial expressions that occur in various counting problems, have generalizations associated with surfaces of complicated structure that can be calculated effectively by topological recursion. The exact same formula computes important quantities arising in the study of quantum gravity. Topological recursion not only provides theoretical formulas for many concrete problems in mathematics and physics, but also furnishes a practical computational tool. The interplay between machine computation and mathematical proof has been a driving force for recent rapid development of the field, in which many outstanding conjectures have been resolved, while new mysteries have arisen, both on the theoretical front and in computer experiments.  This timely symposium, in which half of the invited speakers are early-career researchers, is aimed to further advance this exciting, rapidly-developing field.<br/><br/>Topological recursion is a new emerging field of mathematics developed in statistical mechanical study of random matrices. Independently, essentially the same structure of the theory was discovered in research on the volume of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces. Due to the simple nature of concrete recursive formulas, topological recursion relates many current research frontiers of mathematics in a novel and understandable way. For example, counting Hurwitz numbers, Gromov-Witten theory, Gaiotto's conjecture on opers arising from string theory, the WKB analysis of Schroedinger equations, and the relation between A-polynomials and colored Jones polynomials for knots and their generalizations are all deeply related through ideas stemming from topological recursion. The goal of the symposium is to promote interest among young researchers in this exciting research frontier and to significantly enhance the subject matter by disseminating recent progress and identifying important problems for future development.

Questions to be investigated in this project lie at the crossroads of two major pathways in mathematics of the past two centuries. One of them is the in-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic curves, in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi, Riemann, Klein, and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual landscape of mathematical physics, dictated by the progress of classical, statistical, and quantum mechanics, and often associated with the names of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare, Hilbert, Einstein, and Weyl. Some of the questions under study are motivated by mathematical questions arising out of string theory; in turn, the research is expected to provide feedback to string theorists inspiring previously unanticipated directions of research.<br/><br/>The specific aim of this project is to develop a new chapter of the Gromov-Witten theory, that is, the theory of topological invariants of phase spaces of Hamiltonian systems, where the characters of permutation groups, acting by renumbering of marked points on the Cech cohomology of coherent sheaves over moduli spaces of stable maps of holomorphic curves to a target Kahler phase space, are studied and computed. The ongoing and forthcoming research of such permutation-equivariant K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants is to include: (a) constructing these invariants and exploring their general properties; (b) developing the symplectic loop-space quantization formalism for representing the invariants by generating functions; (c) establishing the appropriate Quantum Riemann-Roch Theorems to provide the complete adelic characterization of permutation-equivariant K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants in terms of cohomological Gromov-Witten invariants; (d) developing the fixed-point-localization techniques for computing permutation-equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants; (e) applying the techniques in order to obtain K-theoretic analogues of the mirror formulas (i.e., to identify toric q-hypergeometric functions with certain genus-0 permutation equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants of toric manifolds); (f) introducing and studying the K-theoretic mirrors (i.e., complex oscillatory representations of such q-hypergeometric functions, and the corresponding D_q-modules); (g) elucidating the role of the groups of q-difference operators acting by hidden symmetries in the permutation-equivariant quantum K-theory, and exploiting these symmetries to reconstruct all the genus-0 invariants of toric manifolds from the respective q-hypergeometric functions; (h) expressing twisted permutation-equivariant K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants in terms of the untwisted ones by combining the boson-fermion correspondence with the adelic characterization in higher genus; and (i) exploring the relationships between quantum K-theory of the point target space and the q-analogues of the KdV-hierarchy of integrable systems, anticipated by analogy with the Witten-Kontsevich theorem for cohomological Gromov-Witten invariants of the point."

A minimal surface mathematically models the shape of a soap film; the energy of such a film is proportional to its surface area, and so stable configurations are those with least area, that is, minimal surfaces. The theory of minimal surfaces directly connects to problems arising in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. More broadly, minimal surfaces are an important model for many geometric variational problems -- that is, problems where one seeks to find and study the properties of geometric objects that are optimal in some sense. In addition to being a fundamental principle in the physical sciences, variational problems arise in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics. In contrast to minimal surfaces, which are static, the mean curvature flow is a dynamic process. Roughly speaking, mean curvature flow continuously deforms a surface in a manner that decreases area as quickly as possible. It was first studied as a model of certain phenomena in materials science and has also found applications in computer graphics and image recognition. Furthermore, it is closely related to the Ricci flow that was employed in the solution of the Poincaré conjecture. As such, the mean curvature flow has promising potential applications to topology, several of which are explored by this project. <br/><br/>This project will use the mean curvature flow to investigate hypersurfaces in n-dimensional Euclidean space of low entropy, that is, hypersurfaces for which a natural measure of geometric complexity, the entropy, is small. It also studies properties of minimal surfaces in Euclidean three-space using a variety of techniques. The first goal is to better understand properties, especially topological ones, of hypersurfaces of low entropy. This requires the investigation of the structure of non-compact self-similar (both shrinking and expanding) solutions to the mean curvature flow. The overarching objective is to see if hypersurfaces of low entropy in Euclidean four-space must smoothly bound a closed ball. This question is closely related to the smooth four-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture, an important open problem in low-dimensional topology. The project also studies several problems connected to the theory of minimal surfaces. Chief among these is the question raised by Calabi, refined by Yau, and partially answered by Colding-Minicozzi, asking whether a complete, embedded minimal surface is properly embedded. In addition, the project explores the relationship between ideas in projective differential geometry and minimal surface theory. This includes studying an analog of the Korteweg-de Vries equation and investigating free-boundary minimal surfaces in the ball."

Singularities can range anywhere from black holes in astrophysics to turbulence in fluid mechanics to the accumulation of cancer cells in biomedical research. Such physical phenomena are often described by differential equations that involve time and space. Studying the qualitative behavior of the solutions of these equations frequently deepens one's understanding of the related physical problems. To study a singularity of a solution one uses a so-called blow-up procedure that allows one to focus attention near the singularity and to exploit the scaling properties that the differential equation enjoys. Because of the change in the scaling of space and time, this process leads to a new solution that is defined for all space and time, in other words to a ""global solution."" The classification of global solutions, when possible, sheds new insight into the singularity and thus into the underlying physical phenomenon. <br/> <br/>This project addresses the questions of existence, uniqueness, and  qualitative behavior of global solutions to nonlinear geometric elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Emphasis is given to the classification of ancient solutions, the construction of new ancient solutions from the gluing of solitons, and the study of fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows in the complete noncompact case. The interplay between analytical and geometric techniques will be a crucial factor in carrying out the research. The project links a wide range of active fields of mathematics, including nonlinear partial differential equations, differential geometry, and classical analysis. The principal investigator also intends to seek applications of the mathematical results to other disciplines such as quantum field theory and image processing. Results will be disseminated to the research community at various meetings and by publication of research articles. Special emphasis will be given to the training of Ph.D. students."

The first of these is the mathematical problem of recovering the structure of the Earth from seismic measurements. The project takes into account that the Earth is best modeled as an elastic medium; that it consist of several cores, and that it is anisotropic (i.e., that the speed of seismic signals can depend on the direction).  A second problem is motivated by applications to cosmology: to determine the stage of the early Universe, to the extent possible, from the cosmic microwave background radiation measurements. Finally, the principal investigator will study the mathematics of new medical imaging methods that use two different waves to form an image: one wave (electromagnetic, for example) is sent to the human body to excite the cells, which creates another type of wave (acoustic, for example) that one measures away from the body. In all the aforementioned examples, one is especially interested in solving local problems using local information: when measurements are done locally (say, on some part of the boundary of the relevant domain), one's desire is to recover the object locally, as well. Indeed, in many practical applications such measurements can only be done locally, and very often one is interested in the object under scrutiny only in a region near the point where the measurement is taken. The goal is to understand how much information is included in the measured data, to determine how sensitive such information is to noise and measurement errors, and to devise a means of using this data to reconstruct the object.  <br/><br/>More specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) recovery of a Riemannian metric, up to isometry, on a compact manifold with boundary near a strictly convex boundary point from localized lens/distance boundary data; (2) recovery of a Lorentzian metric up to a gauge transformation from boundary measurements; (3) recovery of both types of metrics from wave equation data on the boundary; (4) solving the inverse problem for the elastic geophysics model with piecewise smooth Lame parameters; (5) inversion of the geodesic and the light ray transforms; and (6) solving inverse source problems that arise in medical imaging. Theses include both linear and nonlinear problems, from well-posed to mildly ill-posed to ill-posed. The aim is to recover the leading term in the underlying hyperbolic equation, which determines the geometry. Unlike much previous work in the area, this project allows for the existence of conjugate points, albeit modulo some additional geometric assumptions. The problem of local recovery a Riemannian metric in boundary/lens rigidity, up to isometry, is very challenging because simple linearization does not work, and there is inherent nonuniqueness. The principal investigator expects to combine ideas from tensor tomography, Melrose's scattering calculus, and other new ideas to deal with the nonlinearity. His methods would prove global uniqueness and stability as well, under the condition that the manifold admits a strictly convex foliation. Existence of conjugate points is not excluded. The inverse problems in time-space, including the integral geometry ones, lack ellipticity because only space-like singularities are recoverable. This makes the problem ill-posed. The light ray transform is a restricted ray transform, requiring specialized microlocal tools, not even fully developed yet for nonflat metrics. Those problems are of interest in geometry (where they are called rigidity problems), in the part of the theory of partial differential equations known as inverse kinematic and inverse boundary-value problems, and in applications like geophysics."

Its mathematical significance has become apparent by the fact that it could be used to prove various conjectures, such as the Poincaré and Geometrization Conjectures in 3-dimensional spaces. A general expectation in the study of Ricci flows is that the flow produces a geometry in the limit that is somehow inherent to the topology, i.e. the loose makeup, of the underlying space. Most often, however, the flow develops certain singularities, which have to be removed by so-called ""surgeries"" before the flow can be continued. Despite their powerful topological implications, Ricci flows with surgery are still not well understood in dimensions 3 or higher. The goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the long-time behavior of 3 dimensional Ricci flows with surgery, and the dependence of the evolved geometries on initial conditions. Moreover, the study of Ricci flows in higher dimensions is suggested.<br/><br/>The proposal is split into three projects. The first project concerns the analysis of the long-time behavior of 3 dimensional Ricci flows with surgery. This project builds on previous work of the principal investigator, in which the finiteness of the number of surgeries was established and in which an initial description of the flow's long-time asymptotics was derived. The objective of the second project is to construct continuous families of Ricci flows with surgery, starting from a given continuous family of Riemannian metrics. In such families, surgeries may move continuously in space and time depending on the parameter, and they may appear or disappear. A successful construction of such families can most likely be used to solve a conjecture that states that the space of positive scalar curvature metrics on the 3-sphere is contractible. Moreover, it may be used to solve the Generalized Smale Conjecture, which classifies the topology of diffeomorphism groups of spherical 3-manifolds. In the third project, the principal investigator proposes the work on several problems associated with the study of Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature. This study is a continuation of previous work conducted in collaboration with Qi Zhang. The suggested problems include the analysis of singularities in 4-dimensional Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature, and the study of non-collapsed, long-time existent Ricci flows, especially in dimension 4."

Historically, symplectic geometry grew out of studying situations such as this, in which the collection of all possible positions and momenta of the system (phase space) was seen to have the structure of a special space known as a symplectic manifold. Physical laws, like conservation of energy, then gave rise to models of the systems as dynamical systems on submanifolds of phase space corresponding to different energy levels. Modern symplectic methods have established deep connections between global properties of symplectic manifolds and the associated dynamics on a special class of energy levels, namely contact-type hypersurfaces, but have thus far proved to be of rather limited use for a general energy level. This project aims to rectify this deficiency and use global symplectic techniques to study dynamics on arbitrary energy levels by analyzing a generalized class of curves, known as feral pseudoholomorphic curves. <br/><br/>This project concerns research at the interface of geometric analysis, symplectic topology, and dynamical systems. The key idea is the use of a certain newly defined class of infinite Hofer-energy pseudoholomorphic curves, namely feral curves, to study Hamiltonian flows on prescribed energy surfaces in symplectic manifolds of arbitrary dimension and certain volume-preserving flows on three-manifolds in general. More specifically, the aim is to study these curves and their properties and to use them to establish non-minimality of a wide range of volume preserving flows in dimension three. A further aim is to study the generic asymptotic limit of such feral curves and to determine whether or not symplectic field theory admits an extension to symplectic manifolds with generic smooth boundary. Successful completion of this research has the potential to solve the volume-preserving Gottschalk conjecture, broadly extend symplectic field theory, and possibly yield key new insights on low dimensional differential topology."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

On the other hand, deep insights in geometry and physics help the development of analysis. This research project investigates questions at the interface of the three areas motivated by string theory.  Results of the project are anticipated to have important consequences in several directions, including advances in algebraic geometry and number theory, enhanced understanding of mirror symmetry, modeling of gravitational waves, and application of differential geometry in discrete settings.<br/><br/>This research project explores the theory of duality between Calabi-Yau manifolds based on the SYZ picture pioneered by Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow.

There are nonlinear equations governing the supersymmetric geometry behind string theory. Some of the equations generalize Hermitian Yang-Mills equations, although the questions under study in this project are more nonlinear.  One of the current investigations is intended to determine existence criteria for these differential equations.  Another project will explore symplectic cohomology as a possible tool to study mirror symmetry.  An ongoing collaborative project seeks to describe quasilocal physical quantities in general relativity. Ideas of analysis will also be applied to study graph theory."

In this project, the PI will focus on compact almost complex manifolds by using a new kind of geometric flows, which evolve an almost complex structure to a symplectic structure. One motivation is to understand precisely when a compact four manifold with an almost complex structure supports a symplectic structure.

The goal is to bring together experts from mathematics and physics to consolidate the current development of the theory and extend its potential for applications to questions of importance in applied fields, as well as to train undergraduate and graduate students to work in this relatively young area with a wealth of accessible open problems. In the 20th century, the evolution of notions of geometric structures, such as Riemannian structures, complex structures, symplectic structures, and contact structures, has had an important impact both in the development of mathematics and in applications to many other areas of study. Generalized geometry is both an extension of these structures and a framework for analyzing the relationships between them. Although the concept is only about fifteen years old, it has made significant contributions both to understanding how various geometric structures on a space interact and has seen applications in string theory and supergravity.  <br/><br/>Generalized geometry is a contemporary approach to the study of differentiable manifolds in which the group of diffeomorphisms is extended to include additional symmetries known as B-field transforms. This enlarged symmetry group, which arises naturally from the point of view of loop spaces, has been studied extensively by geometers and string theorists and continues to provide an invaluable bridge connecting the two fields. In addition, since each classical geometry can be realized as a generalized geometry, it provides a framework for studying relationships between various types of classical geometric structures that can occur on a manifold and has been a source of surprising results in this regard. So this topic has intrinsic interest from a differential geometric point of view as well as with respect to possible physical applications. There has been a wealth of results produced in the first decade of activity in generalized geometry that has attracted much interest from mathematicians and theoretical physicists. So far, it has been primarily focused on even-dimensional manifolds, partly because of the special role played by generalized complex structures in string theory. However, recent work suggests that generalized geometry of odd-dimensional manifolds might be just as mathematically rich and physically useful as its even-dimensional counterpart. While significant steps toward a better understanding of odd-dimensional analogues of generalized complex structures (also known as generalized contact structures) have been made, the subject presents specific challenges and it is still in its infancy. To address these issues, this workshop has the following scientific goals: <br/>1) Consolidate the progress made in odd-dimensional generalized geometry in the last two to three years by providing an accessible survey of the most recent developments, with particular emphasis on generalized contact geometry. <br/>2) Bring together experts working in generalized complex geometry and generalized contact geometry with the aim of developing a unified understanding of generalized geometry. <br/>3) Bring together physicists and mathematicians working in generalized geometry to better understand the role of odd-dimensional generalized geometry in string theory and identify open problems of interest for both communities. <br/>4) Advertise generalized geometry, with particular emphasis on odd-dimensional aspects, to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. Besides the obvious benefits of attracting new generations to the field, it offers excellent opportunities for involvement of students in research at an earlier stage. The very nature of this subject often requires deconstruction and critical rethinking of classical notions, and thereby makes it an invaluable training ground for any student interested in differential geometry.
