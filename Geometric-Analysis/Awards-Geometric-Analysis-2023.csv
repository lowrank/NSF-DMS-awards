In light of the recent major advances in the Zimmer program, the main goal of the conference is to have a timely meeting of researchers to educate participants on these advances and discuss new directions. The conference will help educate junior mathematicians about these advances and help bring them to the forefront of this active research area. The workshop will consist of three minicourses on different aspects of Groups and Rigidity Around the Zimmer Program, together with research talks, a lightning talks session for grad students, some discussion sessions and plenty of time for informal discussions.  Participants will include leading U.S. and European researchers from the different areas related to the centerpiece of the workshop, as well as younger researchers, both graduate students and postdocs. The lecture series will provide an opportunity for the researchers to educate each other and the workshop participants about techniques and recent advances in the area. By the end of the workshop we expect the participants to be able to draw enough parallels between the different techniques to be able to put them to use and open new directions of research stemming from the interaction among the topics. The conference will help to educate graduate students and recent PhDs on the latest developments in the field and bring them to the forefront of research. The majority of funding will support junior participants coming from the USA. The organizing committee will encourage and support broad and diverse participation. In particular, women mathematicians and members of other under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply for support.<br/><br/>The workshop include the following three minicourses on topics related to recent advances in the Zimmer program: 1) An update on the current state of the Zimmer program (David Fisher, Rice University), 2) Actions of lattices on geometric and Furstenberg boundaries (Thang Nguyen, Florida State University) and 3) Centralizer rigidity (Amie Wilkinson, University of Chicago).

Symplectic resolutions are mathematical jewels; they possess a wealth of interesting structures, which are of interest to mathematicians and theoretical physicists working in different areas. As a result, new discoveries about symplectic resolutions often have a wide impact across many parts of mathematics and physics. As a mathematician working in an area called symplectic geometry, the PI (along with collaborators) will study certain algebraic structures associated to symplectic resolutions called Fukaya categories. The PI also will mentor undergraduate and graduate students wishing to enter this area of mathematics. To this end, the PI will write publicly available lecture notes aimed at advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students.<br/><br/>Fukaya categories of symplectic manifolds are a class of algebraic structures defined via nonlinear analysis, by counting pseudoholomorphic curves with appropriate Lagrangian boundary conditions. There are long-standing expectations that Fukaya categories of symplectic resolutions should be related to structures arising in representation theory. The PI intends to work on several questions in this direction, using techniques from microlocal sheaf theory. Such techniques have only recently become available thanks to the fundamental work of Ganatra--Pardon--Shende, and the PI believes that they are particularly promising for these types of questions.

Earth is an example of a geometric space where angles and distances can be measured. Another example is Euclidean spaces used to model our physical world. Additionally, non-Euclidean or Riemannian spaces have numerous applications, notably in cosmology, allowing scientists to describe the large-scale structure, curvature, and topology of the universe, and in robotics, providing engineers with a mathematical framework to model the range of motion of robotic systems. Just as cartographers construct maps to reveal spatial information about regions on Earth, mathematicians construct maps between geometric spaces to uncover interesting features and analyze their geometry. In this research project, the principal investigator (PI) will focus on harmonic maps, a special type of maps that minimize a specific measure of energy between geometric spaces. By analyzing harmonic maps, the PI aims to uncover essential properties of various geometric spaces, contributing to a better understanding of the natural world. The mathematical theory of harmonic maps has practical applications in medicine (e.g., medical imaging) and computer science (e.g., computer vision), with potential to further scientific progress and societal welfare. Moreover, the project includes an educational aspect, offering guidance and support to graduate students, post-docs, and early-career mathematicians, especially those underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Harmonic map theory holds significant interest for mathematicians and physicists, playing a vital role in geometric analysis by serving as analytical objects that incorporate geometric, topological, and algebraic information of a given space. The techniques involving harmonic maps have been successfully applied in various mathematical contexts, yielding important results in rigidity problems, Hodge theory, and Teichmüller theory. The principal investigator (PI) will continue developing the theory of harmonic maps, motivated by its potential applications in different mathematical fields. The primary focus of the proposal revolves around three key areas: (1) Non-Abelian Hodge Theory, aiming to develop non-abelian Hodge theory over smooth quasi-project varieties and connecting topological data of Kahler manifolds to their holomorphic structure; (2) Geometric Rigidity, exploring a geometric approach to study the rigidity of lattices in semisimple Lie groups, particularly non-uniform lattices associated with non-compact manifolds and studying representations of lattices in isometry groups of smooth and singular spaces; (3) Regularity of Harmonic Maps, concentrating on problems related to the regularity theory of harmonic maps into singular targets, with the goal of better understanding singular sets and their potential applications.

The equations that the PI and collaborators consider were first discovered in materials science, engineering and applied mathematics and are extensively studied in pure mathematics. These geometric flows are nonlinear generalizations of the heat equation and the nonlinear effects lead to new phenomena, including the development of singularities even when starting from a smooth initial configuration.

Mean curvature flow is a nonlinear parabolic evolution equation that originated in materials science and has been intensely studied in pure and applied mathematics.

The key is to understand the singularities. Function theory plays a role, both continuous and discrete, and unique continuation.

The main tools of study fall into two categories: algebraic and analytic. The algebraic tools are the frameworks of wrapping up global information and making calculations, while the analytic tools are techniques for solving differential equations and for constructing the algebraic frameworks.

Spectacular successes go back at least to Donaldson?s work on the Hitchin?Kobayashi correspondence, and continue to the present, with the proofs of the Poincar\'e and Geometrization Conjectures, the Differentiable Sphere Theorem, and the Generalized Smale Conjecture.  There are still many key open problems of fundamental importance in a range of areas for which geometric flows provide a natural approach, and for which other methods have proved unsuccessful thus far.  Geometric flows are nonlinear, parabolic evolution equations for key geometric quantities, which lie at the heart of a rich and developing theory combining the study of partial differential equations and differential geometry. The most well-known examples of these flows are the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow, both of which have significant applications, particularly to topology. By using additional data on the manifold (for example, a complex structure), one can define geometric flows which now can now be used to study these more refined geometries. This has proved extremely fruitful, for example in applications (both potential and realised) to gauge theory, the study of the minimal model programme and related problems in complex and algebraic geometry, symplectic topology, Mirror Symmetry and exceptional holonomy. <br/>The website for the conference is: https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2023/geometric-flows-and-applications<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A manifold is a mathematical object which looks locally like ordinary Euclidean space, but can have higher or lower dimension. Two-dimensional manifolds are called surfaces (e.g., the surface of a football, a donut or a pretzel), while our universe is an example of a 3-dimensional manifold. The study of deformations of possible geometric structures on manifolds arises naturally in many fields of mathematics as well as in physics. The PI will also contribute to the mathematical community through involvement in the Inquiry Based Learning Center at the University of Michigan, his involvement in the formation of the MACSS scholars program which is designed to support low-income students majoring in Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, curriculum development for undergraduate courses, serving as editor of mathematical journals, organizing conferences, and mentoring undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project focuses on the study of the Hitchin component of higher rank structures on surfaces and on space of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds.  The Hitchin component is the pre-eminent example of a Higher Teichmuller space of representations of a closed surface group into a semi-simple Lie group. Striking analogies with classical Teichmuller theory have been discovered, including pressure metrics which generalize the Weil-Petersson metric from classical Teichmuller theory. The metric completion of the Teichmuller space of a closed surface, with respect to the Weil-Petersson metric, is the augmented Teichmuller space, which one may view as the orbifold universal cover of moduli space. PI will study the metric completion of the Hitchin component with respect to a pressure metric and to develop a geometric theory of the augmented Hitchin component which parallels the classical theory. The proof of Thurston?s Ending Lamination Conjecture developed many new tools for the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and their deformation spaces. In the original proof of the Ending Lam- ination Conjecture one obtains uniform bilipschitz models for hyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to an orientable closed surface.

The equations studied in this project exhibit a certain degree of degeneracy or singularity. Degenerate elliptic equations demonstrate significant differences from uniformly elliptic equations, an important class of nondegenerate counterparts. Solutions of degenerate elliptic equations have much worse properties than those of uniformly elliptic equations (typically, a loss of smoothness of derivatives at some level). The classical analysis of uniformly elliptic equations, emphasizing the regularity of solutions (i.e., smoothness of their derivatives), is inadequate for studying degenerate elliptic equations. The theme of the project is the analysis of solutions to these equations near sets where degeneracy or singularity occurs. One of the main tasks is to study the properties of solutions in new formats and to identify optimal conditions for the existence and regularity of solutions. Such a task is reflected in all problems in this project. The central part of this project is dedicated to the development of new methods and techniques in studying the properties of solutions of degenerate and singular elliptic differential equations. In addition to pursuing fundamental problems in geometry and physics, this project also contributes to establishing a general framework to study several important classes of degenerate elliptic differential equations and advancing our knowledge of these equations. Student training and interdisciplinary collaborations are important aspects of this project. Three graduate students in mathematics and one graduate student in electrical engineering participate in this project. <br/><br/>The project will study degenerate or singular elliptic partial differential equations. Due to the complexity and diversity of the types of degeneracy, it is impossible to develop a general theory for degenerate elliptic equations. The project focuses on three classes of degenerate elliptic equations that appear frequently in geometry and physics. The first class is the uniformly degenerate elliptic equations. Many important geometric problems are reduced to this class of equations. These equations are defined on compact manifolds with boundaries and degenerate only on boundaries, with a uniform rate of degeneracy in terms of the distance to the boundary. The second class of equations consists of elliptic equations that are singular at isolated points, with a uniform rate of singularity in terms of the distance to the singular point. Asymptotic expansions demonstrate that solutions to these two classes of equations are singular with specific singular factors. The primary objective of the research on these equations is to study the impact of these singular factors on the existence and regularity of solutions. The third class of equations consists of elliptic equations and systems of elliptic equations that are singular in a set of codimension 2. This class of equations appears in the study of radially symmetric solutions to the Einstein equation, near the extreme Kerr solution. The research on this class of equations will study the asymptotic behaviors of solutions near punctures and to prove the mass and angular momentum inequality. Completely different methods are required to study these three classes of equations, although they differ only in the dimension of the sets where degeneracy occurs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In general, those quantities that measure the shape of the manifold are called curvature. The study of one particular kind of curvature -- Ricci curvature -- is one of central topics in differential geometry and has significant connections to general relativity. This project seeks to study the geometry and topology of spaces whose Ricci curvature can't be too low, i.e., where this curvature has a lower bound.  The notion of Ricci curvature lower bounds can also be extended to singular spaces (e.g., spaces with cone tips) which may not have manifold structures. Investigating these singular spaces can in turn advance the understanding of Ricci curvature on smooth manifolds. The broader impacts of this project include raising awareness of the importance of singular spaces through seminar and conference presentations, bringing modern concepts and ideas in geometry to students in an accessible way, as well as mentoring undergraduates in these areas.<br/><br/>In one direction, the project will study the fundamental groups of complete and non-compact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Specifically, this will investigate the relation between the structure of fundamental groups (for example, finite generation and virtual nilpotency) and the equivariant asymptotic geometry. The project will also aim to understand the geometry of Ricci limit spaces, especially that of singular sets with large Hausdorff dimension. Lastly, the project will explore the fundamental groups of closed manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below, including their stability under the Gromov-Hausdorff topology and uniform control on the group structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes they are technical obstacles to overcome, while in other cases they encode essential features of the problem being considered. In this research  the focus is on singularities of minimal submanifolds and of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. Minimal submanifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of minimal surfaces, which model soap films. Their study is very classical, but some basic questions remain unanswered about their behavior near singularities. Special Lagrangian submanifolds are a particular kind of minimal submanifolds, which have received a great deal of attention recently due to their appearance in string theory. The Lagrangian mean curvature flow is a natural evolution process by which we can attempt to find special Lagrangian submanifolds, however once again the appearance of singularities is the basic difficulty. This research project aims to understand some common features of singularities which appear in families, in contrast with most previous research that focused on isolated singularities. Progress on this problem will have applications to many other related questions in geometry and analysis. The project also includes several educational activities aimed at increasing interest and success in STEM fields at all levels. Specifically, the educational activities include: a week long summer math circle aimed at students in grades three to five; support for undergraduate research; the continuation of a summer undergraduate workshop in geometry and topology; and the continuation of a bridge program for beginning graduate students to ease transitioning to graduate school.<br/><br/><br/>The most basic information that can be obtained from a singularity in many geometric problems is its tangent cone or tangent flow. The question of the uniqueness of such ""tangent objects"" is one of the most basic problems in geometric analysis and it is only well understood when singularities are isolated. The PI will study non-isolated singularities in two related settings: minimal hypersurfaces and the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. The tools developed for understanding the uniqueness of tangent cones and flows in these settings will also have applications to important geometric problems: the classification of minimal hypersurfaces with prescribed behavior at infinity; the generic smoothness of minimal hypersurfaces; and the possibility of surgeries at singularities along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow in connection with the Thomas-Yau conjecture. In addition to these specific applications, the PI expects that the new methods introduced in connection with the above problems will have applications in other areas of geometric analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end, the PI will advance the techniques of auxiliary differential equations, aiming to analyze the compactness of the space of the family of Kahler metrics. Along this path, it is expected that new analytic tools such as uniform Poincare and Sobolev inequalities, as well as heat kernel estimates, will be developed.

For example, choosing an optimal driving route could involve minimizing the total distance traveled or the total energy consumed by the vehicle. The mathematical study of such questions is known as the Calculus of Variations. Mathematicians seek to improve our big-picture understanding of questions like ""what does the optimal configuration look like?"" or ""if I deviate slightly from the optimal configuration, how much more energy do I use?"" The principal researcher's work is focused on such problems that arise geometrically. For example, just like the optimal driving route might minimize the length between the starting and ending points, a soap film spanning a wire loop can be modeled by saying that it tends to form the configuration that minimizes the surface area among all possible shapes spanning the loop. Closely related ideas include functionals from materials science that model contact between distinct phases of matter. Even though these are natural and well-studied settings, many basic questions about the shape and nature of optimal configurations remain unsolved.  These projects will focus on the notion of ""stability"" which is related to the question of how a configuration compares to nearby-less optimal-configurations, and specifically will study the ramifications of stability for such questions about optimal configurations. One key component of these activities will involve training the next generation of researchers to tackle such problems. This will be accomplished by mentoring and teaching as well as creating publicly accessible educational materials describing cutting edge research topics.<br/><br/>This research program will focus on stable minimal hypersurfaces and related problems. Jointly with Chao Li, the principal investigator has recently solved the stable Bernstein problem in four-dimensions: a complete stable minimal hypersurface in four-dimensional Euclidean space is flat. A series of questions will be studied that are connected to stable minimal hypersurfaces as well as related problems such as scalar curvature, with the eventual goal of understanding stable Bernstein problem in higher dimensions. Similar problems will be investigated for related areas such as the Allen-Cahn equation. These projects will also consider the relationship of stability and scalar curvature comparison geometry, as well as investigate weaker forms of stability (finite Morse index) as it relates to the min-max constructions of minimal (and other) surfaces.

The aim of the workshop is to bring together two intellectual communities that have recently made significant advances in the study of discrete subgroups of higher rank semi-simple Lie groups: the homogeneous dynamics community and the higher rank Teichmuller theory community.  The event is timely, since techniques from homogenous dynamics are becoming increasingly prominent in the study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups in both fields. Each morning there will be two mini-course lectures, intended to introduce researchers to techniques from both fields, while the afternoon will be devoted to research lectures. Bringing together these two groups will lead to further interactions and will accelerate development in these exciting areas.  The organizers are committed to funding a diverse group of mathematicians.<br/><br/>Homogeneous dynamics deals with flows on the quotients of Lie groups by discrete subgroups. There is a well-developed, now classical, study of orbit closures, measure classifications, counting and equidistribution results in homogeneous spaces of semisimple Lie groups of finite volume, i.e. when the discrete subgroup is a lattice. These ideas have had many applications in seemingly unrelated areas, for example, the solutions of the Oppenheim and Littlewood conjectures in number theory, and more recently in Teichmuller dynamics.  In the last decade, there has been significant progress in extending this theory to study discrete subgroups of rank one Lie groups which are not lattices. The fundamental tool in this work is the theory of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to actions of discrete subgroups on the geometric boundaries of hyperbolic spaces. The time is ripe for the pursuit of generalizations of these works to higher rank homogeneous spaces of infinite co-volume.  This theory has already seen exciting preliminary development in the context of Anosov representations.<br/>Further details about the workshop, including a full list of speakers, are available at the conference website: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/8759/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions connect to various problems in dynamics, low-dimensional topology, and algebraic geometry and use new techniques developed by the PI and collaborators. Recent groundbreaking work has shown that each GL(2, R) orbit closure of a point in a stratum of the Hodge bundle is locally linear in period coordinates, but as yet no classification of these orbit closures exists. The PI will make progress in classifying all GL(2, R) orbit closures in hyperelliptic loci of strata that are ?sufficiently big?, and will use the theory of Hurwitz spaces to build a purely combinatorial mechanism for producing new orbit closures. In addition, using recent work on geminal orbit closures, the PI will uncover properties of totally geodesic submanifolds in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. This inquiry will lead to a deeper understanding of when complex geodesics in Teichmuller space are holomorphic retracts.  The PI will also study the moduli spaces of complex affine structures to make progress on a conjecture that strata of the Hodge bundle are aspherical in the orbifold sense; and will work on a program to determine the Hausdorff dimension of the set of divergent Teichmuller geodesic rays. Put together, these projects will resolve open questions about the geometry of moduli space, while shedding fresh light on the study of rational billiards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the concept of a groupoid allows for more general symmetries that act on collections of objects rather than just a single one. This project tackles fundamental questions of importance in differential geometry and the mathematical theory of quantization by employing a combination of groupoid techniques and semi-classical analysis. The project's significance lies in its potential to uncover new fundamental aspects in geometry and unravel mysteries surrounding the nature of quantization in physics, which are crucial for understanding the geometric aspects of our universe. The project involves collaborations with researchers from Europe and South America. Additionally, the project's lead investigator will be involved in the organization of international meetings, summer courses, and a weekly seminar at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.<br/><br/>The project consists of three main tasks. The first task introduces a novel approach to non-formal deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds, where the star products have kernels defined by semi-classical Fourier integral operators. This approach has two objectives: establishing a connection to integrability through symplectic groupoids and proving the existence of star products for a wide range of Poisson manifolds. The second task focuses on the PI's research on Poisson manifolds of compact type (PMCT), which are central objects in Poisson geometry analogous to compact Lie algebras in Lie Theory. The current goals are to develop the theory in the non-regular case and study Hamiltonian spaces of PMCTs, extending classical results for Lie group actions. This includes investigating Hamiltonian spaces of symplectic torus bundles, which generalize symplectic toric manifolds. The third task continues the exploration of an approach to classification problems of geometric structures using Cartan's realizations and employing Lie groupoid techniques, pioneered by the PI and collaborators.

The original concept dates back to Bernhard Riemann's famous Habilitation lecture ""Ueber die hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen"" (On the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry) delivered on 10 June 1854. The revolutionary creations in this lecture profoundly changed the global landscape of geometry. Specifically, Riemann proposed a novel strategy to generalize the geometry of surfaces to higher dimensions which he called Mannigfaltigkeiten (manifolds). A large variety of new notions and concepts were created: these include the notion of curvature which quantitatively measures how a space is curved, and the notion of geodesic which is a length-minimizing path connecting two points on a manifold. The studies of the metric structures of manifolds, what we now call metric Riemannian geometry, primarily focuses on the interplay between the global geometry of the underlying space and the metric structure, namely how the distance between two points can be realized or measured. This project is mainly concerned with the metric geometry of Einstein manifolds where the metric structures satisfy the Einstein equation in the theory of general relativity.  The PI will integrate their research with training and mentorship at a variety of levels.  This includes organizing summer workshops and mathematical retreats on  Riemannian geometry; complex geometry and theoretical physics, and designing and developing new research oriented courses for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project investigates the degenerations and quantitative behaviors of Einstein manifolds. In joint work with Song Sun, the PI has been working on the collapsing geometry of Einstein manifolds with special holonomy, leading to two major breakthroughs in the field: a complete classification of the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of the Einstein metrics on the K3 manifold, and a complete classification of asymptotic model geometries of gravitational instantons. The latter can be regarded as the bubble limits of the degenerating Einstein metrics on the K3 manifold.  Building on this background, the PI will proceed to analogous questions in higher dimensions and investigate geometric structures for the degenerating Einstein metrics with generic holonomy in that setting. With a group of collaborators, the PI will also make advances in more refined geometry and moduli space problems regarding complete Calabi-Yau metrics. In a third direction, the PI will investigate the geometry and analysis of Poincare-Einstein spaces, which originated from the AdS/CFT correspondence in mathematical physics. The PI will focus on the singularity behaviors of degenerate operators on Poincare-Einstein manifolds, geometric finiteness and quantitative rigidity of Poincare-Einstein metrics, as well as regularity and degeneration theory of Poincare-Einstein metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project concerns a particular notion of curvature, called the scalar curvature. Scalar curvature determines the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. Curvature arises throughout the natural sciences, and particularly in general relativity, where scalar curvature is the Lagrangian density of the Einstein-Hilbert action. A natural yet deep question is to understand the effects of scalar curvature on the global properties of a manifold.  In particular, the project will focus on geometric variational problems, including minimal surfaces and soap bubbles. Minimal surfaces arise as the mathematical model of a number of interfaces in nature. In general relativity, minimal surfaces occur as ?apparent horizons? of black holes; soap films and capillary interfaces also provide examples of minimal surfaces. Some key questions include the existence, regularity and topology of minimal surfaces. These two aspects of the research are deeply related, and will advance our understanding of the shape of nature.  The PI will integrate this research with a variety of knowledge-disseminating activities that include organizing seminars, conferences, mini-courses, and reading groups, and giving public lectures. <br/><br/>The proposed research concerns a range of topics in differential geometry, geometric measure theory and partial differential equations. Particularly, the PI would like to focus on the following four main topics. The first topic is the investigation of the obstruction problem for manifolds with positive scalar curvature, including the well-known `K(pi, 1) conjecture?. The second topic is to further understand the geometric comparison theorem for scalar curvature lower bound using Riemannian polyhedra. Minimal surface and soap bubbles are key technical tools for such problems. The third topic is to further investigate the stable Bernstein problem for minimal surfaces in R^n. The fourth topic is to further study the moduli space of positive scalar curvature metrics on 3-manifolds (with or without boundary). Understanding such questions has potential applications in 4-dimensional general relativity and in topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since antiquity, mathematicians have studied surfaces such as spheres, ellipsoids, paraboloids and hyperboloids in three-dimensional Euclidean space. These surfaces, familiar to the Greeks, can all be described in cartesian geometry by equations of the second degree. Modern algebraic geometry, as developed primarily in the 20th and 21st centuries, provides tools to study surfaces defined by equations of higher degree. While a single equation of degree five (for example) may define a smooth surface in three-space, a pair of such equations will define a pair of surfaces, and the intersection of the two surfaces will be a curve in space. The project will seek to answer long-standing questions about the possible singularities of a curve arising in this way, using tools that first arose in the description of the fundamental forces of nature at the atomic and nuclear scale. These same tools will also be used in addressing questions about network flows. At the same time, the project will train graduate students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.<br/><br/>The project activity will be in the following specific areas. In collaboration with T. S. Mrowka, the PI will develop properties of an instanton homology for spatial trivalent graphs and for knots in general three-manifolds. In particular, tools will be developed that will enable the calculation of instanton homology more generally than is currently possible. This instanton homology was constructed in previous work using a gauge theory related to representations of the fundamental group of complement of the knot or graph in the group of rotations, SO(3). When defined using a local coefficient system, instanton homology of knots and links yields new constraints on the topology of embedded surfaces whose boundary is a given knot or link. Specifically, it yields information about the possible genus of such surfaces and the number of their singularities. The final goal is to develop these tools to the point where they will answer long-standing questions in algebraic geometry concerning the topology of algebraic curves. For example, the PI will seek a negative answer to the question of whether two smooth quintic surfaces can intersect in an irreducible singular curve of genus zero.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such geometric objects play an important role in pure mathematics, as well as in various areas of science and engineering. This project focuses on understanding metric and geometric properties of surfaces, i.e. notions of length and angle. Deforming the metric structure of a surface gives rise to so-called `moduli spaces?; each point in the moduli space represents a particular geometry on the underlying surface. The PI will continue to investigate two natural classes of surface geometry: (i) singular flat metrics, and (ii) hyperbolic (negatively curved) metrics. Improved understanding of flat metrics has led, and will continue to lead, to new results in dynamical systems. Hyperbolic metrics are, in a certain sense, the most natural metrics to put on these surfaces. This project will also investigate various structures on the moduli spaces of surfaces, notably measures, which provide for a well-defined notion of `random surface?. The PI will use and further develop analogies between the two types of metrics, as well as connections to graph theory, probability theory, spectral geometry, and algebraic geometry.  The broader impact of this project includes the generation of questions and topics suitable for graduate students. The PI will maintain an involvement with programs aimed at bringing together early-career researchers to work on problems in concentrated and collaborative settings.<br/><br/>In the flat metric setting, the PI has used the new multi-scale compactification of strata of translation surfaces to prove strong regularity of ergodic SL_2-invariant probability measures, verifying a natural heuristic about affine invariant manifolds. This result, and the techniques in its proof, have already been applied by others to study random Teichmuller geodesics and counts of pairs of saddle connections. In another joint work, the PI has proved restrictions on the type of equations that can define an affine invariant manifold near the multi-scale boundary, thereby providing a new proof of Wright's Cylinder Deformation Theorem and generalizing it to meromorphic strata. The PI will use the above results and techniques to study, via degeneration, the centrally important classification problem for affine invariant manifolds, as well as problems about the less studied k-differentials for k>2. The PI has also developed a research program concerning random hyperbolic surfaces, a young and active field. Together with Sapir, the PI has proved a conjecture concerning the relative number of simple versus non-simple closed geodesics for various notions of random surfaces, as genus tends to infinity.  There is a fruitful analogy between random hyperbolic surfaces and random regular graphs; the PI has solved, and continues to investigate, problems on both sides of the coin.

Although these invariants have been developed and used to resolve various longstanding conjectures in recent times, several mysteries remain, and new horizons continue to come into focus. The project aims to complete foundational work related to spectral invariants, clarify how they relate to each other, prove new and more refined results, explore higher dimensions, and study potential new and important applications. A synergistic educational component is centered around building a digital hub for undergraduate mathematical research, supporting mathematics education of incarcerated individuals, and supporting high school education beyond the traditional curriculum through volunteer efforts.<br/><br/>In previous research, the PI proved symplectic analogs of Weyl laws for embedded contact homology, periodic Floer homology, and link spectral variants in dimensions 2, 3, and 4, recovering classical symplectic invariants from the asymptotics of more modern ones.

While symplectic manifolds have no local invariants, they do have interesting global ones. A major part of this project is concerned with ?Gromov-Witten? invariants, which aim to probe a symplectic manifold by studying maps from two-dimensional surfaces into the manifold that satisfy an appropriate partial differential equation. These invariants are very powerful, but it can be quite difficult to get good control over them because of their non-local nature. One key goal of the project is to prove new fundamental facts about Gromov-Witten invariants on certain symplectic manifolds that are defined by polynomial equations. The general strategy the PI will use is to ?cut open? the manifold along a divisor. The corresponding invariants of the divisor complement turn out to be very tractable and also provide a stepping stone towards understanding the Gromov-Witten invariants of the original space. The PI will continue to serve as a mentor to high school students at MIT's Research Science Institute, and will organize a workshop on homological mirror symmetry for graduate students. He will also continue to work on developing a Master?s program in mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Boston. <br/><br/>Specifically, in the main strand of the project, the PI will prove that the quantum connection on a Fano manifold with a smooth anti-canonical divisor has a singularity of unramified exponential type. The strategy is to view the quantum cohomology of the Fano manifold as a deformation of the symplectic cohomology of  the complement of the divisor. The symplectic cohomology of the complement can in turn be studied via the wrapped Fukaya category, allowing one to bring tools from noncommutative geometry to bear.  In a different direction, the PI will build on his previous work to relate the symplectic cohomology of an affine log Calabi-Yau variety to certain intrinsic mirror algebras recently constructed by algebraic geometers. The PI will then go on to study homological mirror symmetry for intrinsic mirror pairs using a combination of symplectic and categorical techniques also developed in previous work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is organized by the PI Kim Ruane in collaboration with Christopher Cashen (University of Vienna), Sangyun Kim (Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology), and Yash Lodha (University of Hawaii). This is the 16th edition of an annual series, previous iterations of which have been held in ten different countries on four continents. The goal of the conference is to bring together both early career and established researchers in combinatorial, asymptotic, and geometric aspects of infinite group theory together with researchers in dynamics and discrete probability, to consolidate recent advances based on the interplay between these subjects and to spark new interactions. The conference will feature plenary talks and a discussion session of open problems. Organizers plan a targeted recruitment process to broaden participation among groups that are traditionally underrepresented in these fields. <br/><br/>The topics of the conference include random walks and boundaries, ergodic-theoretic methods, and groups of dynamical origins. The conference will feature three plenary talks. The first will focus on interactions between geometry and discrete probability with applications to random walks, percolation, and the Ising modeling of statistical mechanics. The second involves applications of the geometry of buildings and group actions on cell complexes with climate scientists, in the implementation of the computer package that is used in climate simulation and weather prediction. The third talk will cover applications of combinatorial curvature to analyze the structure of geometric networks.  Probabilistic properties of random walks on groups reveal a close relationship between geometric and algebraic properties. This relationship has been made explicit for the class of hyperbolic groups via the equivalence of the Martin and Gromov boundaries. Exploring this relationship outside the class of hyperbolic groups has resulted in the construction of new notions of boundaries that will be discussed at this conference. Ergodic-theoretic notions and theorems from the classical setting of manifolds have just begun to be understood for more general spaces and groups. Much work remains in relating ergodic-theoretic, group-theoretic, and geometric invariants even in the hyperbolic case.  Finally, groups of dynamical origin have recently provided new examples of infinite groups that settle long-standing open problems in the area. Those examples as well as future directions for study will be discussed at the conference as well.

The topic of the conference is ?Geometry and Analysis of Groups and Manifolds?. The conference involves participants and speakers from three different mathematical communities, namely geometric flow, analysis on metric spaces and geometric group theory, with emphasis on the connection between these fields. The goal is to create a conducive environment for collaborations between these different communities of mathematicians. The participation of early career US mathematicians in a major conference like this will help maintain and enhance the leading position of the US in mathematical science research in the relevant areas. The principal investigators and organizing committee will make a concerted effort to identify and support participants from under-represented groups in mathematics. The conference will hold poster sessions for early career mathematicians to present their works, and select some of them for short talks. This conference will also disseminate knowledge to the broader mathematical community as the organizers plan to record all the talks and put the recordings on the internet.<br/><br/>In recent years, there have been strong interactions between questions in geometric analysis and low dimensional topology/geometric group theory. On one hand, questions and examples from low dimensional topology and geometric group theory have inspired rapid development in geometric analysis. On the other hand, analytic methods have been used to prove deep theorems in low dimensional topology and geometric group theory. There are several emerging new connections between these fields, like the recent work of Kleiner-Muller-Xie where they used ideas from the analytical side of geometric mapping theory to study rigidity and regularity of quasiconformal maps between certain spaces and groups, work of Kleiner-Lang where they used metric currents in geometric measure theory to study the large scale geometry of high rank analogues of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, work of Song on the spherical Plateau problem on group homology which connects a geometric variational problem with algebraic and topological properties of groups, etc. The goal of the conference is to bring together experts from these various different fields to exchange views and collaborate on important questions in these fields.

This conference series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers alike. The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians inspired by problems arising in physics, and physicists searching for new mathematical tools. The meetings also serve as a unique forum for junior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson geometry and to disseminate their own research results in the field.<br/><br/>Poisson geometry originated as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history began with classical work by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the work of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The annual workshops provide an excellent opportunity for members of various groups working on related areas from different perspectives to exchange new ideas and stimulate collaboration. The goal of each workshop is to address important questions and future directions of the subject.
