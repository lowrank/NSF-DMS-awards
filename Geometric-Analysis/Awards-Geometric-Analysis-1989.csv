More specifically                         Mischaikow is concerned with deriving algebraic invariants                      which describe invariant set, determining how they can change                   through bifurcations, and determining which geometric                           structures are imposed on the invariant sets by the algebraic                   invariants.  The guiding philosophy in this development comes                   from the fact that many differential equations that arise as                    models of biological, chemical, or physical systems share the                   following three characteristics:   (1) they are derived from                    idealized descriptions of complicated phenomena, (2) they are                   parameterized systems and the exact values of the parameters                    are not known,  and (3) they are non-linear.  Thus, from an                     applied point of view describing the global and robust                          structures of the solutions to these differential equations is                  of great importance.                                                                 Mischaikow's research makes extensive use of the Conley                    index and, in particular, of a relatively new tool called the                   connection matrix."

Another                   important question addressed in this project concerns the                       extremal length geometry of Teichmuller space.

He will also explore generalizations of the Bloch                     manifold construction to other contexts such as the triangular-                 ization of a surface of arbitrary genus.                                             This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science, Robotics, and                       Physics."

One is interested in what happens overall,               on average, in the long run, which may be quite difficult to                    infer solely from what happens over short intervals of time.  A                 seemingly straightforward example figures prominently in the                    project of Professor Veech, namely the flow described by billiard               balls careening about inside a triangular region. Trajectories                  will either essentially fill out the whole triangle over time or                be periodic, coming back on themselves after a finite number of                 bounces. Classifying and describing the periodic trajectories                   requires some surprisingly sophisticated mathematics. In                        particular, it turns out to be advantageous to relate billiard                  flows to flows and other group actions on more exotic geometric                 objects.                                                                             At a technical level, this has to do with the ergodic theory               and dynamics of the action of SL(2,R) on Teichmueller space.                    Professor Veech is studying the prevalence of points in this                    space whose isotropy subgroups for the action are lattices.                     Certain such points arise from triangular billiards. The                        difficult problem of length spectrum for a flow, i.e. of what                   lengths of periodic orbits can occur, will be studied in various                geometric contexts."

The study of the relationship between shapes of surfaces and types of periodic orbits has its origins with Poincare at the turn of the century. For example, any vector field on the sphere must have a fixed point. Thus the wind cannot blow everywhere on the surface of the earth at the same time; there must be still air somewhere. The principal investigator will extend current theory which explains which kinds of periodic behavior on surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds are permitted."

And these methods will be extended to other geometric variational problems with symmetry or approximate symmetry. Three-dimensional space is an example of a three-manifold. If infinity is collapsed to one point, this space becomes the three-dimensional sphere. This sphere has constant sectional curvature because relative to every plane at every point, the sphere bends the same.
