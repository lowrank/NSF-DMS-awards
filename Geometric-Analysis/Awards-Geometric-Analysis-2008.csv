The past 15 years have witnessed  an explosion of activity in this area. It interacts extensively with other area: besides the rest of algebraic geometry, it has very important intersections with complex analysis, symplectic geometry, string theory, homotopy theory, geometric topology.<br/><br/>A workshop and conference titled ``Aspects of Moduli Theory'' is organized, to be held June 15-28 at the de Giorgi Center in Pisa, Italy. This activity is meant to offer a wide view of many aspects of the field. It will be split into two parts. The first week will consist of a summer school, in which high level experts will teach five courses on recent and very important advances in the subject. During the first part of each course  he teacher will present the necessary background material, making it accessible to graduate students and beginning researchers. During the second week a regular conference will take place.<br/><br/>The program aims to impact a considerable number of advanced graduate students and post-doctoral fellows who will attend this program."

The strategy for the construction is to desingularize the intersection of two known examples by adapting the method N. Kapouleas used to construct embedded minimal surfaces; the Principal Investigator will use a Scherk's singly periodic minimal surface to get an approximate solution which is then perturbed to obtain a complete self-similar surface. The project is very geometric in nature, but it involves many techniques from nonlinear partial differential equations. <br/><br/>Self-similar surfaces model the behavior of the mean curvature flow near singularities under certain conditions; therefore, the availability of examples of such surfaces is important to the understanding of the flow near its singularities and its continuation past the singularities. Unfortunately, there are currently only four know examples of complete self-similar surfaces in dimension two embedded in the Euclidean space. A general classification is hopeless; therefore, it is essential to find successful methods to construct new examples. The broader goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the formation of singularities for the mean curvature flow. <br/>"

The first problem involves the study of heat kernel bounds by stochastic methods. The goal is to find estimates which are independent of dimension and hence applicable to infinite dimensional heat flows.  In the case of hypoelliptic heat kernels, the P.I. is looking for precise heat kernel upper and lower bounds. The second problem is to study the quasi-invariance and smoothness properties of heat kernel measures on infinite dimensional Lie groups. The P.I. hopes to find examples of infinite dimensional subelliptic operators which are hypoelliptic. The proof of these results will rely on the results of the first problem. The third problem relates to the understanding of Euclidean Feynman path integrals by finite dimensional approximations. In particular, it is proposed to carry this program out for super-symmetric path integrals. These results and their generalizations should have ramifications to the Stolz-Teichner program of geometrizing elliptic cohomologies. <br/><br/>In the 1940's, Feynman proposed a beautiful, but highly heuristic, theory for understanding quantum mechanics in terms of the more familiar concepts arising in classical mechanics.   Feynman's heuristic ideas have had a significant influence on the mathematical theory of topology. (Topology is the study of the basic shape properties of surfaces and other more general ""manifolds."") The P.I. will investigate a number of problems related to Feynman's model in the context of elementary particle physics. Despite being studied for 70 plus years, the mathematical foundations of these types of theories are still not well understood and many interesting questions remain open. For example, physicists believe that ""quarks"" should be confined. However, with the current state of the models, the theoretical derivation of quark confinement is out of reach. The specific goals of this proposal are: 1) to use probabilistic techniques to describe qualitative and quantitative behavior of the flow of heat in high dimensional spaces, and 2) to develop methods for understanding the ""super-symmetric Feynman path integral.""  It is hoped that the results developed during this grant period will be applicable to the particle physics models and to mathematical topology. This proposal includes a training component as some of the problems will be given to graduate students.<br/>"

In joint work with H. Bray, the PI extended the Riemannian Penrose inequality from the previously known case of three space dimensions to all dimensions less than eight.  The PI intends to use a singular version of Bray's conformal flow in order to generalize the result to all dimensions.  Another major goal of this project is to prove an analog of the Penrose inequality for asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds, again using a novel version of Bray's conformal flow.  The PI's work on the Penrose inequality is related to the problem of ""small mass.""  The equality case of the Positive Mass Theorem states that Euclidean space is the only asymptotically flat manifold of nonnegative scalar curvature and zero mass.  Building on earlier work of the PI, this project will explore the following question:  In what sense must an asymptotically flat manifold of nonnegative scalar curvature and ""small"" mass be ""close"" to Euclidean space?  Ultimately, the Penrose inequality is likely to be a component of any theory that adequately addresses this question.<br/><br/>The underlying goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the role of mass in general relativity.  Although Einstein's theory of general relativity is a mature theory, there are still many mysteries concerning the total mass of a gravitational system.  This difficulty arises from the nonlinearity of Einstein's theory:  Unlike in Newtonian gravity, the physically relevant notion of the ""total mass"" of a gravitational system is not simply the sum of the masses of the particles that constitute the system.  For example, a Schwarzschild black hole is an example of a gravitational system that has no matter at all and yet still has total mass greater than zero.  This example suggests that a black hole somehow contributes to the total mass; the Penrose inequality is a precise statement that captures this idea.  Some of the ideas in this project are accessible to high school students, and the PI intends to share these ideas with them.  The PI hopes to use students' natural curiosities about the nature of the universe as a means of encouraging greater interest in mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>"

The main project outlined seeks to develop a Delzant theory to classify completely integrable systems on compact manifolds with real algebraic type singularities of their action variables. These are meant to include the systems arising from spherical varieties (Gelfand-Cetlin examples) and those from quiver varieties at a minimum. The key tool would be Bohr-Sommerfeld level sets and their interplay with the geometry of the moment map in Hamiltonian dynamics. Other topics to be treated include regularity of exterior Monge-Ampere solutions and their relation to pluripotential theory; asymptotic geometry at infinity of complex manifolds, and renormalized Chern classes on them; some cases of the Hodge conjecture related to special Hodge-classes on higher dimensional complex manifolds derived from K3 surfaces, and the algebraicization of certain Grauert tubes.<br/><br/>Philosophically, the first project is based on an idea going back to the beginning of quantum mechanics: the Bohr-Sommerfeld levels of a mechanical system, the set of configurations of a classical mechanical system which would contribute significantly to a quantum mechanical understanding of the system, as in, e.g., spectral lines of atoms. There was a later dual description of mechanics in terms of wave functions, and relating the two has been a source of great insight in physics and mathematics. What we suspect we have found, and are trying to prove, is that this Bohr-Sommerfeld correspondence underlies certain classification questions in classical mechanical<br/>systems: how many integrable systems are there? The Bohr-Sommerfeld levels are related directly to classical loci on the underlying space of the mechanical system, while the corresponding wave functions allow one to read off the algebraic geometry of the system. The main problem proposed is to make this ""correspondence"" rigorous, to the point where the systems can be classified by the combinatorial relations among the Bohr-Sommerfeld loci, and some global algebraic geometric data.<br/><br/><br/>"

The list of speakers includes Simon Brendle, Alice Chang, Jean-Pierre Demailly, Gerhard Huisken, Leon Simon, Yum-Tong Siu, Neil Trudinger and Burkhard Wilking.<br/><br/>Professor Hidehiko Yamabe (1923--1960) was an active and highly collaborative mathematician in the School of Mathematics of the University of Minnesota from 1954 to 1960. His sudden illness and untimely death occurred in the same year that he moved to Northwestern University. His work on topological groups, geometry and analysis were outstanding contributions to modern mathematics. In year 2001, we proposed to enhance the Yamabe Memorial Lecture by creating the Yamabe Memorial Symposium, a top-level biennial geometry conference in the School of Mathematics, University of Minnesota. Every two years, perhaps in the Fall of even-numbered years, mathematicians will gather at the University of Minnesota for a long weekend to hear geometry talks, discuss the latest research and interact with graduate students and junior researchers. In each biennium, a specific area within geometry will be singled out for special emphasis.<br/><br/>One goal will be, as a way to honor the memory of Hidehiko Yamabe, to advance areas of mathematics related to his interests, which touched in a substantial and ground-breaking way on several quite different areas of mathematics, all of which may be roughly described as having significant geometric aspects. At the same time, it will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to interact with, and learn from, mathematicians working at the highest international level.  Finally, a long-lasting benefit will be the stimulation of innovative developments in mathematics research.<br/><br/>The first, second and third Yamabe Memorial Symposium were held in 2002,<br/>2004 and 2006 respectively with a great success.<br/><br/>The conference web page is http://www.math.umn.edu/yamabe/.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This workshop, to<br/>be held July 6-10, 2009, at the CIRM (Luminy) conference center,<br/>concerns equivariant generalizations of invariants defined by<br/>holomorphic curves.  In Gromov-Witten theory, equivariant<br/>invariants have been extensively studied by Givental and others,<br/>in the sense of integrals of equivariant cohomology classes over<br/>moduli spaces of stable maps.  The focus of the workshop will be<br/>on the following more sophisticated version of equivariant<br/>Gromov-Witten theory: the study of moduli spaces of maps to the<br/>stack-theoretic quotient of, say, a smooth projective variety by<br/>a reductive group.  By definition, such a map consists of a<br/>holomorphic principal bundle, together with a section of the<br/>associated bundle. From the symplectic point of view, suitable<br/>moduli spaces of such pairs are known as moduli spaces of {\em<br/>symplectic vortices}.  The workshop is organized around this<br/>specific direction, with an aim to bring together researchers in<br/>algebraic and symplectic geometry who have had no previous<br/>interaction.  On the other hand, the workshop will promote<br/>discussion of the interaction of holomorphic maps, gauge theory,<br/>and group actions more broadly.  Applications of the theory are<br/>expected for instance, to the relation between Gromov-Witten<br/>theories of different varieties, and to the relation between the<br/>gauge-theoretic invariants such as Floer-Donaldson invariants and<br/>their symplectic analogs.<br/><br/>We propose a workshop which will bring together gauge theory and<br/>holomorphic curves.  Gauge theory is the study of local symmetry<br/>in mathematics and physics; the most famous example is<br/>electromagnetism.  Holomorphic curve techniques aim, in algebraic<br/>geometry, to understand spaces by understanding the certain<br/>classes of curves in them, or in symplectic geometry, to<br/>understand the periodic orbits of dynamical systems.  Symmetry of<br/>the target varieties may be used as a computational tool, and<br/>also combined with holomorphic curves to define new invariants.<br/>The workshop will focus on recent developments and emerging<br/>applications to algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and<br/>low-dimensional topology.  The workshop will benefit a number of<br/>graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working in this area<br/>who have had little interaction with other groups working on<br/>related problems.<br/><br/>The conference web-page controlled by the organizers is<br/>www.math.rutgers.edu/~ctw/Luminy, while that controlled by the<br/>conference center CIRM is<br/>www.cirm.univ-mrs.fr/web.ang/liste_rencontre/Rencontres2009/Renc346/Renc346.html.<br/><br/>"

The proposed research in analysis on metric spaces has two focal points: bilipschitz embedding problems (and related issues) and the structure of boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic spaces. The projects in geometric group theory are a continuation of my earlier work, which is influenced by Gromov's papers ""Hyperbolic groups"" and ""Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups"", rigidity theory,  3-manifolds, and geometric mapping/function theory;  their principal aim is to address rigidity and uniformization/geometrization problems for groups by analyzing their asymptotic structure with a variety of tools from geometry, analysis, topology, dynamics and combinatorics.<br/><br/><br/>The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation:<br/>evolution of surfaces by mean curvature, and Hamilton's Ricci flow.  Evolution by mean curvature has been studied for decades as a natural model for evolving surface interfaces.<br/>Ricci flow describes an evolving geometry, and was used in Perelman's recent solution of the Poincare conjecture.<br/>The primary objective of the proposed research on these equations is to study singularities and show that they have a very special form.  Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible,  in order to reveal hidden symmetries,  and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist. <br/>This is very useful for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups, and is part of confluence of several research trends over the last 10-15 years.

These Bergman functions are invariant under biholomorphic maps. He intends to use these Bergman functions to study the problem of biholomorphic equivalence of domains in complex varieties. Yau observes that his higher order Bergman functions put a lot of restriction on biholomorphic maps between two complete Reinhardt domains in a variety, from which these biholomorphic maps can be determined explicitly. He develops a new technique to construct a family of infinite number of continuous numerical invariants on complete Reinhardt domains lying in the same variety. He shows that this family of infinite number of continuous numerical invariants is actually a complete set of invariants for either the set of all strictly pseudoconvex complete Reinhardt domains in the variety or the set of all pseudoconvex complete Reinhardt domains with real analytic boundaries in the variety. In particular, the moduli spaces of these domains in the variety are constructed explicitly as the images of this complete family of numerical invariants. He illustrates how this works in a concrete example of A_1-variety. It is well known that A_1-variety is the quotient of cyclic group of order 2 on C^2. Yau proves that the moduli space of complete Reinhardt domains in A_1-variety coincides with the moduli space of the corresponding complete Reinhardt domains in C^2. Since his complete family of numerical invariants are computable he has solved the biholomorphically equivalent problem for a large family of domains in C2. He proposes to continue his work for any quotient singularities. He also proposes to study the rigidity problem of CR morphisms between two strongly pseudoconvex compact CR embeddable manifolds of the same dimension. If the dimension is at least five and the codimension of the target manifold is relatively small, he shows that non-constants CR morphisms are necessarily CR biholomorphisms. He plans to prove the most general rigidity theorem of CR morphisms between two strongly pseudoconvex compact CR embeddable CR manifolds of the same dimension.<br/><br/>    It is well known that singularities theory plays an essential role in main stream of mathematics as well as many branches in Science. For example, by taking a cone over a projective manifold, one can get an isolated singularity at the origin. The classification of projective manifolds can be achieved via the classification of islated singularites.<br/>Therefore in some sense algebraic geometry is contained in the theory of singularities. The Black Holes can also be viewed as singularities of our universe. We encounter singularities in our daily life. Anythings which are not smooth (for example table corner) can be think of as singularities. Hence it is very important for us to understand singularities structures. This project proposes a new way to understand the global structures of singularities. Yau's NSF grant was used to partially support the Midwest Workshop on Complex Analysis and Complex Geometry, April 13--15, 2007 at University of Illinois at Chicago. There were 11 speakers, two of them are female. Yau and Song-Ying Li have organized a Special Session ``Analysis and CR Geometry'' for AMS meeting at De Paul University Oct. 5--6, 2007. There are 23 speakers. The P.I. was the adviser of a high school student Letian Zhang who was selected as the final 40 in the Intel Science competition.

Firstly, the P.I. plans to study the deformations of calibrated submanifolds in G_2 and Spin(7) manifolds. In joint work with S. Akbulut, the P.I. studied complex associative and complex Cayley submanifolds<br/>and showed that the moduli space of these submanifolds is smooth without any obstructions to such deformations. She also introduced the mathematical definitions of mirror Calabi-Yau and G_2 manifolds. This project aims to follow these footsteps and to obtain a compactification of these moduli spaces and to study the mirror dualities in Calabi-Yau and G_2 manifolds. These will lead to the construction of new counting invariants and provide a better understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomenon. In the second part, the P.I. plans to continue her work in noncompact G_2 manifolds. In joint work with D. Joyce, the P.I. studied deformations of asymptotically cylindrical coassociative submanifolds and their Topological Quantum Field Theories. Also, in recent joint work with C. Robles, she studied the Cartan-Kahler Theory for associative and Cayley embeddings into G_2 and Spin(7) manifolds. She plans to use these results to construct new examples of G_2 and Spin(7) manifolds. Similarly, special Lagrangian submanifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds are expected to give analogous Topological Quantum Field Theories. Understanding the special Lagrangian moduli spaces inside degenerating Calabi-Yau manifolds will provide a rigorous framework for the Floer homology program. Therefore, the P.I. plans to study the moduli spaces of asymp. cylindrical special Lagrangian submanifolds with boundary.<br/><br/>The long range goal of studying the geometry and topology of manifolds with special holonomy is to bring a broader mathematical understanding of  M-theory in physics. Despite its highly conceptual nature, M-theory has proven to be of great interest to the U.S. public, yielding popular literature and television specials that describe the essence of this potential ``theory of everything''.  The P.I. believes that this makes M-theory an excellent subject with which to catch the interest of students who might decide to study math and science,and as a female researcher in this exciting area she feels a particular responsibility to encourage young women to begin and to continue their studies of mathematics.  She is currently supervising two Ph.D students and is serving as the faculty advisor of the Society of Undergraduate Mathematics Students. She also organizes the geometry seminars and the colloquium talks at UR. Additionally, she is the co-organizer of the joint Cornell-UR geometry seminars.

In particular, the PI plans to study discrete flows numerically, to develop visualization techniques for abstract manifolds, to further develop the theory of discrete geometries in the spirit of differential geometry, and to prove convergence of these geometries and related geometric operators to the continuum.

In the first project, the PI will work on Donaldson's program of extending Yau's theorem in Kahler geometry to symplectic 4-manifolds.  The ultimate goal is to tackle some fundamental questions in symplectic and almost complex geometry, such as:  given an almost complex 4-manifold, when does there exist a compatible symplectic form?  The second project deals with the constant scalar curvature equation on Kahler manifolds.  It is believed that the existence of a solution to this nonlinear PDE should be equivalent to the algebraic stability of the manifold.  The PI will examine this via the natural energy functionals associated to this problem, building on his work with Phong, Song and Sturm.  The third project concerns the Kahler-Ricci and Calabi flows and aims to elucidate the relationship between the convergence properties of these parabolic flows and conditions of stability and positive curvature.  The final project also involves parabolic PDE's:  the geometric flows of Donaldson which arise naturally from considerations of moment maps and diffeomorphism groups.  The PI will investigate the behavior of these flows, on Kahler and hyperkahler manifolds, and possible applications to the study of canonical metrics and the space of symplectic forms.<br/><br/><br/>The fundamental laws of physics are described, in the language of mathematics, by differential equations.  Understanding the behavior of solutions to differential equations (such as Einstein's equations) is key to unravelling the mystery of the geometry and structure of the universe.  This proposal concerns equations which arise naturally in the study of geometry and are related to, and inspired by, the physical laws.  There is a complex interaction between such differential equations, which are described locally, and the underlying geometry, which is global.  This project aims to investigate this rich interplay between local and global and in the process touch on some basic problems in mathematics:  what are the natural structures in geometry, and how do we find and describe them?<br/><br/><br/>"

Associated to certain sorts of large complex structure limit degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds one can define an intersection complex, which is an affine manifold with singularities. Conversely, given an affine manifold with singularities, Gross and Siebert showed it is possible to build explicitly such a degeneration in terms of ""tropical"" data on the affine manifold with singularities. M. Gross plans to study applications of this construction, and in particular intends to work towards the goal of showing that this construction provides a geometric explanation for mirror symmetry. Ultimately, it will be shown that the same tropical structures determine both numbers of rational curves and period calculations on the two different sides of mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The work proposed by M. Gross lies at the intersection of string theory and geometry. String theory replaces the traditional notion of the point particle with a small loop of string, moving through space-time.<br/>To make string theory compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects six of these dimensions to be a very small ""curled up"" geometric object. <br/>These geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a remarkable association between completely different Calabi-Yau manifolds: certain calculations extremely difficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed by performing completely different, and much easier, calculations on a different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror symmetry.<br/>Since this time, many geometers have been trying to understand the mathematics behind this miraculous observation. The work of M. Gross hopes to give mathematical insight and explanation for the phenomenon of mirror symmetry.<br/>"

One theme is the search for canonical metrics on the class of compact iterated cone-edge spaces; special low-dimensional cases include a new analysis of Riemann surfaces with conic singularities, and more significantly, some robust deformation results for three dimensional polyhedra in space forms. Closely related is a project to determine the deformation theory of noncompact Einstein spaces modeled on noncompact symmetric spaces of general rank; this is a generalization of the theory of Poincare-Einstein metrics which has played a prominent role in many recent papers in conformal geometry, and also in string theory, where it appears as part of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Another project concerns minimal submanifolds of these Poincare-Einstein spaces, and in particular, in three-dimensional convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds. The goal here is to define and study the variational properties of the renormalized area functional on the space of properly embedded minimal surfaces with embedded asymptotic boundary curves; this seems to be a natural context for studying the Willmore functional from differential geometry for surfaces with boundary. Finally, the PI has also been studying geometric evolution equations on singular spaces. The first case in terms of geometric simplicity is the generalization of the curvature flow from the setting of closed embedded curves to that of networks of curves; the goals are to establish a good existence theory for the flow, to examine questions of nonuniqueness and to prove long-time existence to a Steiner network.<br/><br/>To put this work into a broader context, most work in geometric analysis is in the setting of geometric objects which are smooth, i.e. do not have corners, edges or other singularities.<br/>However, spaces with singularities appear naturally and very frequently in geometry, physics and other applications, and it is natural to try to extend the methods and results of geometric analysis to this broader class of objects. However, the appropriate tools from analysis and partial differential equations do not exist in this generality, so a major part of the work needed is to extend these techniques to spaces with singularities. This has been a major endeavour of the PI throughout his career. The specific problems on which he is now working involve refined questions such as the existence and nature of optimal metrics, or shapes, on these singular spaces, and the study of evolution equations which continuously deform such a space into one of these optimal shapes. On smooth spaces, these questions have been some of the principal directions of research in geometric analysis, but their analogues in this singular setting have not been studied in any systematic way. Another problem involves the study of a renormalized version of the surface area of a class of optimal (minimal) surfaces inside a space with constant negative curvature. This is an action functional which has been studied intensively in string theory.<br/>One final part of this PI's work is of an educational nature: he is the founder and director of a residential summer program (SUMaC), held at his institution each year, which is directed toward highly motivated and talented high school students to encourage their continued study of mathematics. This program is now in its fourteenth year of operation.<br/><br/>"

This encompasses such diverse areas as the study of singularities of solutions of the wave equation, which is the ""nearby"" behavior of waves, as well as the asymptotic behavior of waves on curved space-times, such as in general relativity. The project will employ geometric microlocal techniques to explore new problems in these areas. Some of these techniques are constructive, such as the ones used by the author in the description of the scattering operator on asymptotically de-Sitter-like spaces, and some rely on phase-space energy estimates, such as the microlocal positive commutator estimates employed by the author in the proof of the propagation of singularities on domains with corners and in showing that the wave diffracted by a smooth edge is more regular (which can be interpreted as ""weaker"") than the incident wave under suitable hypotheses, in joint work with Melrose and Wunsch.<br/><br/>Most people are familiar with the following two descriptions of the propagation of light. First, in geometric optics, light propagates in straight lines, reflecting from smooth surfaces according to Snell's law (i.e., the angles of incidence and of reflection are the same, as if light consisted of billiard balls). Second, light can be described by the wave equation, its propagation thus being similar to that of water waves. There is a close relationship between these two viewpoints. Namely, for solutions of the wave equation, the propagation of sharp signals (or ""singularities"" of signals obtained, for example, by turning on light instantaneously) is precisely described by the simpler geometric optics picture. Part of this project can be regarded as an extension of this work to a more general setting, such as reflections from curved edges. As wave propagation is ubiquitous in the physical world, a more precise understanding of it has many potential applications, for instance, to inverse problems. In a material with cracks inside it, one would like to find out the location of these cracks by probing the material with waves (say, sound waves, or x-rays). These cracks are typically not smooth (e.g., they may have edges or corners), but they still fit into our general geometric framework. One can use our proposed results -- namely, that the reflections from the tips of the cracks are weaker (in a certain sense) than the reflections from the smooth parts -- combined with the very precise understanding of reflections from the smooth parts, to locate the cracks. The rough conclusion: the tips can be ignored.<br/>"

In joint work with H. Bray, the PI extended the Riemannian Penrose inequality from the previously known case of three space dimensions to all dimensions less than eight.  The PI intends to use a singular version of Bray's conformal flow in order to generalize the result to all dimensions.  Another major goal of this project is to prove an analog of the Penrose inequality for asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds, again using a novel version of Bray's conformal flow.  The PI's work on the Penrose inequality is related to the problem of ""small mass.""  The equality case of the Positive Mass Theorem states that Euclidean space is the only asymptotically flat manifold of nonnegative scalar curvature and zero mass.  Building on earlier work of the PI, this project will explore the following question:  In what sense must an asymptotically flat manifold of nonnegative scalar curvature and ""small"" mass be ""close"" to Euclidean space?  Ultimately, the Penrose inequality is likely to be a component of any theory that adequately addresses this question.<br/><br/>The underlying goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the role of mass in general relativity.  Although Einstein's theory of general relativity is a mature theory, there are still many mysteries concerning the total mass of a gravitational system.  This difficulty arises from the nonlinearity of Einstein's theory:  Unlike in Newtonian gravity, the physically relevant notion of the ""total mass"" of a gravitational system is not simply the sum of the masses of the particles that constitute the system.  For example, a Schwarzschild black hole is an example of a gravitational system that has no matter at all and yet still has total mass greater than zero.  This example suggests that a black hole somehow contributes to the total mass; the Penrose inequality is a precise statement that captures this idea.  Some of the ideas in this project are accessible to high school students, and the PI intends to share these ideas with them.  The PI hopes to use students' natural curiosities about the nature of the universe as a means of encouraging greater interest in mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>"

Manifolds with density are the smooth case of Gromov's mm spaces, although we also consider singularities. <br/>The grand goal is to generalize appropriate parts of Riemannian geometry to manifolds with density. <br/>Advances should improve our understanding of Riemannian geometry; for example, Ricci curvature has many different generalizations to manifolds with density, which just happen to coincide for Riemannian manifolds. Isoperimetric problems provide an excellent entry point. Isoperimetric theorems on Gauss space, the premier example of a manifold with density, have had applications in probability theory, in isoperimetric problems in Riemannian geometry, and specifically in Perelman's work on the Poincar Conjecture. <br/>Methods will include standard and innovative applications of geometric measure theory, Riemannian geometry, and second variation.

Such densities arise naturally throughout mathematics; recent applications include Brownian motion in physics, stock option pricing, and Perelman's work on the Poincar Conjecture. Studying this natural generalization provides new insights into classical geometry. As one important example, for the classical geometry of unit density, the _isoperimetric problem_, central to geometry research since the time of the Ancient Greeks, seeks a region of given volume of least perimeter; in Euclidean space, the solution is a round ball. On a manifold with variable density, the isoperimetric problem seeks the region of given weighted volume of least weighted perimeter.

These lectures will generally reflect the interests and research plans of symplectic topologists, and their collaborators, in Illinois and Indiana. In particular, lecture topics will include, but not be limited to, the following branches of symplectic topology: the theory of holomorphic curves and Gromov-Witten theory; Floer homology and Fukaya categories; the theory of Leftschetz fibrations; three-dimensional contact topology; contact homology and symplectic field theory; dynamics of Hamiltonian flows; applications to low dimensional topology via Seiberg-Witten and Heegard-Floer theory. The meetings will become centers of discussion and research communication in the region.<br/><br/>Over the past twenty years symplectic topology has evolved from an undoubtedly fundamental yet prohibitively intractable field into one of the most popular and exciting areas of mathematical research, producing a constant stream of deeply original and inspiring results. Its origins lie in classical and quantum mechanics but the subject is now closely tied to many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, not least complex analysis, smooth topology, partial differential equations and mirror symmetry.This development has been recognized by major math departments which have recruited symplectic topologists. Now even relatively small geographical areas, such as the regions of Illinois and Indiana to the south and east of Chicago, are home to several healthy groups of researchers. This proposal exploits this circumstance with a regular conference. The meetings will bring together active researchers, graduate students and interested people from other disciplines for a weekend of discussion and collaboration centered around lectures from invited leaders in the field.

Wentworth<br/><br/><br/>The grant addresses several research projects in  geometric analysis.  The first part continues work on the Yang-Mills flow on higher dimensional Kaehler manifolds.  A special focus is a comparison of the analytic singularities that occur along the flow with the algebraic singularities associated to Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of holomorphic vector bundles.  The second project analyzes the topology of moduli spaces of coherent systems on Riemann surfaces.   Coherent systems are related to a variety of geometric objects such as higher rank Brill-Noether loci and holomorphic maps to Grassmannians and other homogeneous varieties.  New methods of Morse theory in the setting of singular spaces provide a framework for these computations.  An ongoing  project  studies energy minimizing maps to the Weil-Petersson completion of Teichmueller space.  Such maps are associated to homomorphisms of fundamental groups of Riemannian manifolds to the mapping class group of a compact oriented surface.  Regularity of harmonic maps is the main issue, as this is related to rigidity questions.   The fourth project consists of further topics related to representation varieties of surface groups.  The PI will continue to investigate the functional on Teichmueller space  defined by the energy of equivariant harmonic maps associated to surface group representations.  A particular aim will be to develop new criteria for the properness and uniqueness of minima of this functional. Results  will have implications for the dynamics of the mapping class group action on the moduli space of representations.  Representations into the isometry group of the complex ball are related to spherical CR-structures, and there are many open questions as to how these relate to hyperbolic structures. The project also proposes to establish new existence and rigidity results.  <br/><br/>A significant branch of mathematical inquiry has been the relationship between the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties of manifolds. Manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of curves and surfaces, and they appear in a variety of situations in pure and applied mathematics. Symmetries are also a natural and fundamental part of physical systems, and the dynamics of these symmetries carries important information.  The research projects in this proposal will further our understanding of some of these objects. The equations studied -- energy minimizing maps and the Yang-Mills flow -- have their origins in the mathematical description of the physical world and are therefore are of great importance to both mathematicians and physicists. <br/><br/><br/>"

One general area of concentration will be that of singularity formation in the Ricci flow, with an emphasis on the study of ancient solutions and Ricci solitons. A central theme in the theory developed by Hamilton, Perelman, and others, is that the local geometry of a developing singularity possesses a relatively rigid structure, modelled, in many important cases, upon these special types of solutions.  It is thus desirable to have as detailed a knowledge as possible of the diversity of forms which they can assume.<br/>Additionally, the co-PI proposes to investigate Type-II singularity development  and the question of unique continuation for the Ricci flow equation.  Another general area of concentration will be curvature flows of hypersurfaces, with an emphasis on the application, interpretation, and further development of differential Harnack inequalities for these flows. One aim will be to refine such inequalities in the setting of evolving spacelike hypersurfaces in Minkowski space, with an eye toward the study of eternal solutions and translating solitons.  In the case of the mean curvature flow, the latter objects are of interest to researchers in general relativity as natural foliations of Lorentzian spacetimes.  In another direction, the co-PI proposes to pursue a potential connection from this setting to the cross-curvature flow, an intrinsic flow of potential use in the study of three-manifolds with negative curvature.<br/><br/>The Ricci flow and other geometric evolution equations considered in this proposal are representatives of the ""heat-flow"" method in geometry, the techniques and objectives of which straddle the field's lively interface with topology, analysis, and mathematical physics.<br/>This method has proven effective in attacking certain cases of one of the most fundamental questions in mathematics, namely, which manifolds admit constant curvature or otherwise canonical geometries? Not only does this question have ramifications for physical models of the universe, but the development of tools attendant to the approach promise to pay continued dividends to the analysis of the many structurally similar nonlinear PDE which occur as models of diverse phenomena throughout the physical sciences.<br/><br/><br/>"

Many geometric problems lead to integral curvatures; for example, the isospectral problems, geometric variational problems and extremal metrics, and Chern-Weil's formula for characteristic numbers. Thus, integral curvature bounds can be viewed as an optimal curvature assumption. The fundamental group is the most basic topological information.

Sobolev spaces<br/>of weakly differentiable maps appear naturally in the solution of<br/>variational or differential equations problems, but the<br/>fundamental theorems on Sobolev spaces of maps between regions in<br/>Euclidean spaces are not necessarily reproduced for maps between<br/>manifolds.  Topology in the domain and range of a mapping space<br/>can prevent approximation of an arbitrary Sobolev map by smooth<br/>maps and can force singularities to appear in solutions to<br/>variational problems.  The principal investigator's work aims to<br/>understand the analytical description of some of these<br/>topologically forced singularities.  Some particular topics<br/>include the rectifiability of defect measure of a general Sobolev<br/>map, Ginzburg-Landau type approximation for maps which are not<br/>weak limits of smooth maps, gap phenomena, extension of maps with<br/>energy control, travelling waves in planar antiferromagnets, and<br/>singularities of minimizing p-harmonic maps.

An important mathematical device for solving<br/>such ""variational problems"" is sometimes called the direct<br/>method: a sequence of realizable configurations that drive energy<br/>down toward a lowest possible value is used to construct a<br/>genuine minimizer, usually by picking out a subsequence that<br/>converges.  To make this process work mathematicians tend to work<br/>in enriched environments such as the Sobolev spaces cited above.<br/>These make convergence easier to establish, and then one has to<br/>show that the candidate minimizer is actually present in the<br/>original setting.  It is a relatively recent discovery that this<br/>procedure sometimes fails if the domain and range of the maps<br/>being studied has a bit of topological complexity, and the<br/>principal investigator's projects seek to analyze the nature of<br/>these occasional failures.<br/><br/>"

More specifically, a typical problem is how  restrictions on curvature, or various boundary conditions, influence the global shape of a curve or  <br/>a hypersurface.

A natural continuation of this work would be to show that the groups are quasi-isometrically rigid. Furthermore, by analogy with a result of Toledo, one could suspect that the groups are not residually finite, which would imply the existence of a non-residually-finite hyperbolic group. Belegradek also plans to investigate relative hyperbolicity for more intricate hyperplane complements that appear as moduli spaces of algebraic surfaces via recent deep works of Allcock-Carlson-Toledo. Negatively curved cusp ends can be studied via collapsing theory, yet a comprehensive structure theory is available only when the curvature is pinched negative. The project aims to study situations where one could construct cusp cross-sections with good geometric properties ensuring that cusp cross-sections collapse.  This builds on Belegradek's work with Kapovitch in the negatively pinched case, as well as on seminal works by Cheeger, Gromov, Fukaya, and Rong.<br/>Other projects involve convergence of manifolds under a lower curvature bound. Aiming to improve on Perelman's stability theorem, it is planned to study topology of manifolds that admit DC (difference concave) structures, with possible applications to smooth stability, and natural connections to geometry of Alexandrov spaces. Another project is to prove relative versions of fibration theorems of Yamaguchi and Fukaya with expected applications to collapse and finiteness for normal bundles to souls in nonnegatively curved open manifolds.<br/><br/>Collapsing theory studies spaces that appear lower dimensional at a certain small scale, and a basic goal is to understand the structure of collapsed regions under suitable curvature assumptions. Hyperbolicity is a way to bring geometric insight into otherwise rigid algebraic objects. The two concepts fit together as hyperbolicity prevents collapsing on most of the space, which gives hope that the collapsed parts can be described in detail. The proposed research may shed light on several fundamental problems in geometry and group theory.<br/>"

Third, the PI will apply the Fredholm<br/>theory in polyfolds developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder to<br/>explore newly emerging invariants from the theory of polyfolds<br/>with operations.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry is the study of spaces equipped with the<br/>basic structure that underlies Hamiltonian mechanics, for which<br/>preferred coordinates give both position and momentum of a moving<br/>object and in which conservation of energy is natural and<br/>inevitable.  The Floer homology theory referred to in the first<br/>paragraph studies such manifolds through the critical point<br/>behaviors of certain auxiliary spaces; this kind of analysis of<br/>critical points goes back to work of Marston Morse circa the<br/>1930s, but its application in the modern context requires new<br/>tools such as the polyfold theory cited above.<br/>"

Viaclovsky<br/><br/>The first project supported by this award deals with regularity and volume growth properties of critical Riemannian metrics in dimension four, and applications to the compactness of moduli spaces and existence of critical metrics, such as anti-self-dual and extremal Kaehler metrics.  With certain geometric noncollapsing assumptions, the appropriate moduli spaces can be compactified by adding metrics orbifold-like singularities. This generalizes results for Einstein metrics to the case of metrics which do not have pointwise Ricci curvature bounds. A long-term goal is to extend the compactness theorem to include the possibility of collapsing, and to find other applications to the differential topology of four-manifolds. <br/>The second project deals with orthogonal complex structures, and the relation with subvarieties of twistor spaces. The corresponding equation is conformally invariant, so a natural problem is to find properties of varieties which are invariant under the action of the conformal group. <br/>This has applications to understanding the geometry of compact Hermitian manifolds. The third project involves deformation of curvatures, existence of solutions to fully nonlinear curvature equations, and relations with Riemannian functionals on three and four-manifolds. A crucial problem is to conformally deform a metric to prescribe a symmetric function of the eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor (generalizing the Yamabe problem), and to find natural conformally invariant conditions so that a metric can be deformed from a weaker integral pinching condition to a stronger pointwise pinching condition.<br/><br/>    An important motivation for this research is to understand the relationship between the geometry and the topology of a space. The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles (the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is less appealing that the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which minimizes the total energy.  This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of the our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. The projects described above are to define appropriate energies on such spaces in dimensions three and four, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy.<br/><br/>"

Modular reproducing properties (Hecke-type actions) are to be studied in connection with dispersionless hierarchies of KP and Toda type, for which the main open question is the construction of a Frobenius-manifold structure, with prospective applications to an analytic theory for Hurwitz spaces over curves of genus greater than one.  Related projects of postdoctoral mentoring character (projective connection over moduli spaces of rank-2 bundles for curves of genus 3 and related dualities) are to be conducted long-distance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The theory of special functions came to life through the strong symbiosis of mathematics and physics that pervaded the work of the masters of analysis and geometry in the nineteenth century.  An extraordinary revival of the connection between mathematics and physics came about in the late 1970s, triggered by  the discovery of integrable hierarchies of partial differential equations.  This gave rise to intense activity on both classical and novel questions of modularity (the dependence of a function on its governing geometric object, e.g., a curve), the main focus of this proposal.  The analysis of modular functions is to be applied geometrically to stratifications of commutative and non-commutative tori, through classical and quantum theta functions.  A widespread feature in this area is that of ""strange dualities"" between geometries: several modular interpretations are proposed, with consequent applications to systems of practical interest.  In a nutshell, this proposal is aimed to giving a notion of quantum integrability of a new kind, starting with a theory of the quantized functions and ideally progressing toward unification of physical models.  Students and postdoctoral fellows are to be involved in the projects and participate in workshops and activities of interdisciplinary kind.<br/>"

In past proposals  the principal investigator has used this approach to produce many new examples of nonnegative  curvature, including some on exotic spheres. The present proposal studies a specific class of manifolds that admit an isometric group action with one dimensional quotient and which he considers to be excellent candidates for new examples with positive curvature. These candidates were obtained in a previous proposal as part of a classification theorem. The principal investigator plans to study a concrete class of metrics on these manifolds and has obtained considerable expertise in their curvature properties already. This project is extremely difficult and is expected to require a long term time investment.<br/>There are many questions of a more general nature within this subject of ``\nnc\ with large isometry groups"" that the principal investigator plans to study, and which promise a much quicker return. Finally, as was done in past proposals with success, studying topological properties of new and known examples can be very difficult but also very rewarding.<br/><br/><br/>Manifolds with positive sectional curvaturecan be defined by the property that the sum of the 3 angles in any triangle is larger than 180 degrees, i.e.<br/>their geometry is similar to that of the round sphere. Global Riemannian geometry can be described as relating local invariants like curvature to global topological invariants. Since the beginning of global Riemannian geometry, manifolds with positive or more generally non-negative curvature have been an important part of this subject. A basic unsolved question is whether exotic spheres, i.e. manifolds that look like spheres but on which ordinary calculus is quite different, can carry positively curved metrics. <br/>Symmetries are an important aspect of many geometric questions and the principal investigator plans to study manifolds with positive or more generally non-negative curvature under the presence of a large symmetry group.

There will be travel<br/>funds made available to select participants of the latter group<br/>with a special emphasis on women and underrepresented<br/>minorities. It should be pointed out that four of the twelve<br/>speakers are women. The background to the conference consists of<br/>the work on supersymmetry pioneered by the physicists such as<br/>Zumino, and Ferrara (both speakers at the conference), and the<br/>work of the mathematicians Kac, Moody, and others who brought<br/>focus to infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications<br/>to quantum field theory. In the 1990's the group theoretic point<br/>of view was applied successfully to the theory of meromorphic<br/>differential equations and their moduli. Very recently important<br/>new progress has been made by the development of a supersymmetric<br/>Mackey theory and its applications to super particle<br/>classification, by work on differential Galois group theory of<br/>difference equations, and by the work on the foundations of<br/>super-geometry.<br/><br/>Symmetry is one of the most fundamental and useful notions in<br/>both mathematics and theoretical physics. For example it explains<br/>the mysteries of the periodic table of chemical elements such as<br/>why hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. An example of<br/>symmetry is the following; consider an ordinary square made with<br/>wire, rotate it 90 degrees about its center and notice it comes<br/>back onto itself although the molecules of the wire have<br/>moved. Do it again, you still get the same square. When you do it<br/>the fourth time, i.e., you rotate it 360 degrees the molecules of<br/>the wire come back to where they started. In mathematical<br/>language this says that &#147;the cyclic group of order 4&#148; is<br/>the symmetry group of the square. It is a wonder that the notion<br/>of symmetry and group can be extended and enriched to explain<br/>complicated sub-atomic physical phenomena as well as solve<br/>fundamental problems in mathematics coming from areas such as<br/>cryptography. The symmetries to be considered in this conference<br/>are part of this same story. Of perhaps particular interest is<br/>the theoretical notion of supersymmetry used in the study of<br/>sub-particle physics. The founder of this notion, B. Zumino, will<br/>speak at this conference. It is presently a theoretical<br/>hypothesis that many believe to be true but which awaits<br/>experimental verification. It is one of the main goals at the<br/>European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva to use its<br/>multi-billion dollar Hadron Collider which comes on line in 2008<br/>to experimentally establish the supersymmetry hypothesis.

Boyland, Louis S. Block,<br/>Alexander N. Dranishnikov, James E. Keesling<br/><br/>The University of Florida Department of Mathematics will host a<br/>joint Ulam Centennial and 43rd Annual Spring Topology and<br/>Dynamical Systems Conference (Ulam Centennial STDC-2009) from<br/>Saturday, March 7 through Thursday, March 12, 2009.  The Annual<br/>Spring STDC's are among the nation's most successful series of<br/>topology/dynamics conferences.  Stanislaw Ulam would turn 100 in<br/>Spring, 2009. He was one of the preeminent mathematical<br/>scientists of the 20th century and a Graduate Research Professor<br/>at the University of Florida.  In light of Ulam's many<br/>contributions to topology, dynamics, and related fields, it is<br/>very fitting that the annual STDC be combined with an Ulam<br/>Centennial. The joint conference will maintain the basic<br/>structure and sessions of the STDC, but will be extended by 3<br/>days to allow additional special sessions and plenary lectures in<br/>the areas of Ulam's many contributions to mathematics and<br/>science.<br/><br/>Topology studies generalized notions of spatial structure;<br/>Dynamical Systems studies the topological and analytic nature of<br/>time evolution. Each is a fundamental part of modern mathematics<br/>and has applications as far ranging as robotics, fluid mixing,<br/>computer networks and cardiac rhythms.  Conferences are<br/>fundamental to the strength and development of mathematics, and<br/>as such are a fundamental part of the national scientific<br/>infrastructure. This conference will combine the latest results<br/>in Topology and Dynamical Systems with many applied topics<br/>associated with Stan Ulam. While Ulam is perhaps best remembered<br/>by the public for his participation in the Manhattan Project, his<br/>mathematical and scientific contributions were wide and<br/>deep. They include significant work in numerical methods,<br/>classical mechanics, dynamical systems, number theory, graph<br/>theory, set theory, and ergodic theory. Inspired by Ulam's<br/>example, the conference will advance top quality research in<br/>Topology and Dynamical Systems while facilitating broad and deep<br/>interaction among adjacent mathematical research areas and<br/>between abstract and applied research.<br/>"

In the first project, the PI will work on Donaldson's program of extending Yau's theorem in Kahler geometry to symplectic 4-manifolds.  The ultimate goal is to tackle some fundamental questions in symplectic and almost complex geometry, such as:  given an almost complex 4-manifold, when does there exist a compatible symplectic form?  The second project deals with the constant scalar curvature equation on Kahler manifolds.  It is believed that the existence of a solution to this nonlinear PDE should be equivalent to the algebraic stability of the manifold.  The PI will examine this via the natural energy functionals associated to this problem, building on his work with Phong, Song and Sturm.  The third project concerns the Kahler-Ricci and Calabi flows and aims to elucidate the relationship between the convergence properties of these parabolic flows and conditions of stability and positive curvature.  The final project also involves parabolic PDE's:  the geometric flows of Donaldson which arise naturally from considerations of moment maps and diffeomorphism groups.  The PI will investigate the behavior of these flows, on Kahler and hyperkahler manifolds, and possible applications to the study of canonical metrics and the space of symplectic forms.<br/><br/><br/>The fundamental laws of physics are described, in the language of mathematics, by differential equations.  Understanding the behavior of solutions to differential equations (such as Einstein's equations) is key to unravelling the mystery of the geometry and structure of the universe.  This proposal concerns equations which arise naturally in the study of geometry and are related to, and inspired by, the physical laws.  There is a complex interaction between such differential equations, which are described locally, and the underlying geometry, which is global.  This project aims to investigate this rich interplay between local and global and in the process touch on some basic problems in mathematics:  what are the natural structures in geometry, and how do we find and describe them?<br/><br/><br/>"

One particular focus will be joint work with Peter Kronheimer concerning a Floer homology theory built from connections with a prescribed singularity along a link in a three manifold.  When specialized to links in the three sphere this will invariant appears to be closely related to the Khovanov homology of the link.  Kronheimer and the PI intend to further explore this theory and understand more clearly its relation to Khovanov homology.  With a student, Maksim Lypyanskiy, the PI intends to further explore a new foundation for  Floer homology based on a theory of semi-infinite dimensional cycles.  This appears to lead to a drastic simplification of theory.  With another student, Ben Mares, the PI hopes to begin to put into place the mathematical theory of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills equations.  Finally with third student, Timothy Nguyen, he hopes to understand the hyperbolic Yang-Mills equations especially in dimensions 3+1.<br/><br/>The models physicists have constructed for understanding particles in high energy physics, like that Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten equations, have proved to be a source for many exciting developments in mathematics as well.  Most notably these models figure crucially in understanding  phenomena in dimensions three and four that still seem out of reach by other methods.  The PI has been a leader in the mathematical developments of these models and will continue research in a number of different directions on these models.  One project with Peter Kronheimer seeks to relate two quite different seeming models.  Another seeks to development new mathematical foundations for exploration of these models and will hopefully lead to a great simplification in the rigorous mathematical construction of these models.  Finally with some students Mrowka will explore new models in hopes that they too will have interesting mathematical consequences."

It is organized jointly by the Federal University of Ceara (UFC) and the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA).<br/>The XV Brazilian School of Differential Geometry is dedicated to the 80th birthday of Manfredo do Carmo, the grandfather of differential geometry in Brazil, who has established a flourishing group of geometers all over the country.<br/>The School of Differential Geometry is a major event in Brazil which takes place every two years in various parts of the country, most recently in Niteroi, Goiania Sao Paulo, and Salvador. Its purpose is to describe recent developments in Differential Geometry through research talks and lecture series by national and international experts.  Two advanced surveys this year will be by Ko Honda on ""Contact geometry"" and by Frank Pacard on ""Nonlinear PDE methods in geometry"".<br/><br/><br/>The geometry school has a tradition of  giving lecture series that take place at several different levels. Some are for advanced undergraduates and some for graduate students in order to encourage them to go into Differential Geometry. Others are at a more advanced level geared towards research mathematicians and advanced graduate students, giving a survey of recent subjects of particular interest. This year there are surveys on contact geometry and on geometric analysis.  In addition there are research talks by Brazilian and international experts.<br/>The conference will thus provide a rich environment in which US graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s  can learn about new developments in geometry, There is a tradition of interaction between mathematicians in the US and those in Brazil. A second goal of this grant is to foster new interactions between younger mathematicians  and their Brazilian counter parts. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This conference will feature<br/>both introductory and advanced lectures on the rapidly developing relationships among these established fields. Since the fundamental tools in these research areas are quite different, there is a need for experts in different aspects of the conference to both present overviews of their subjects and point out the interactions among these topics. <br/><br/>Speakers and participants have been invited from the US and Europe. Already over 30 top mathematicians from the three conference fields have agreed to attend, including Spencer Bloch, Alain Connes, Alexander Goncharov, Dirk Kreimer, and Richard Melrose. The attendance for this conference is expected to be roughly 75 -- 100 mathematicians and mathematical physicists. <br/><br/>The three fields of motives, quantum field theory, and pseudodifferential operators are well established and active as independent fields, but until the past decade they have been viewed as essentially disjoint enterprises. The theory of motives was developed by Grothendieck in the 1960s as an arithmetic algebraic geometric setup incorporating diverse cohomology theories. Perturbative quantum field theory first appeared around 1945 to explain laboratory results in quantum electrodynamics and other field theories, and depends heavily on the calculation of Feynman integrals. Finally, the theory of pseudodifferential operators, dating from the 1960s, is a framework to treat all classical differential, Green's and heat operators in one setting.<br/><br/>Until recently, connections among these apparently very different fields were limited mainly to the appearance of Green's operators in quantum field theory. The unexpected appearance of multiple zeta values as values of Feynman<br/>integrals indicated a deep connection between quantum field theory and motives, the usual setting for multiple zeta functions. In addition, the Hopf algebra structure encoding the complicated combinatorics of Feynman integrals, <br/>uncovered by Connes and Kreimer, appears both in the theory of multiple zeta values and symbol calculations for pseudodifferential operators. Further research has shown that the connections are much more than coincidences, and<br/>the work of Bloch, Connes, Esnault, Kreimer, Marcolli and others points towards the possibility of a noncommutative geometry explanation or a direct motives/quantum field theory connection.<br/><br/>This is the first conference on this topic in the US. Since junior faculty and graduate students are encouraged to attend with partial NSF support, the schedule will include introductory lectures on the three conference areas and on Hopf algebras and multiple zeta functions. Other speakers will give research level talks on the conference areas, with a particular emphasis on their interactions."
